RAINBOW Michael McKenny

Chapter Fourteen Destiny

Suddenly the north wall of the room began to bulge inward. There was
an amazing display of pyrotechnics as our wards flared and faded.
They became an ugly shade of pink, turned to a crystal transparency
and then were gone. A great gaping hole stood there, and through the
middle of that hole, striding out into the middle of the room before
us came a man, or rather an inhuman entity, attired all in black. It
clutched before it a great black staff, and from that staff radiated
an evil as intense as anything arising from this volume it had come
to rescue.

The thing confronting us tossed back its cowl. No doubt that was to
impress us all the more with its loathsome nature, with its
extraordinary ability to defy the laws of life and death. What we
were looking at and what was looking at us was a grinning skull,
whose reddish eyes stared at us with a malevolence in no measure
less than the hate we had felt from this thing on the table before
us.

The book mewed and wailed and called. However, try as it did, it
could not lift itself free of the badarn leaf with which it was
bound.

We stepped a pace back from the table and stood side by side. Then
the realization struck that we had been driven back by the will of
our adversary. So, we made a great effort to regain that pace. To
our enormous surprise, we were not successful. Whoever and whatever
this skeleton was, there was no denying the strength of its will.

Again, the three of us exerted our united effort, willing our feet
and legs to carry us forward. Once more our physical flesh refused
to carry out the commands of our minds. It was a very sobering
moment.

At once, the skeleton struck. It raised its staff and I could read
the intent in its eyes to strike and slay by means of that staff the
Wizard of Orange. Orange perceived the same design and wasn't there
when that staff reached the space he had occupied but a dozen
microseconds before.

I felt a shiver pass through my frame. It was the strangest thing
which I have ever felt. It called to mind a childhood illness,
perhaps the feeblest, sickest and tiredest moment of my life. Yet,
somehow I felt less conscious now than I had then. I figured the
sorcerer was pulling somehow on my psychic energy, that his staff,
which had failed to establish physical contact with the Wizard of
Orange, was still close enough to do mischief of a more than
physical kind to me.

There came a momentary blaze of verdant life from my matrix ring. A
vibrant vitality surged through my being. I felt healthy and alert
again.

Then the thought ran through my head that if I was not satisfied
with the eight hundred years and twenty which I had lived, that if
I greedily wished to behold with my eyes the rising of the morning
sun, then I had best leave this place and depart the scene of this
psychic battle at once. It was the typical will weakening kind of
thought which the forces of evil have ever used against the
guardians of Light and I cast it aside.

"Do not meddle with my property," projected the skeleton in front of
us in thoughts rasping with the most sinister accents of the darkest
dialect in our world's history.

"Ownerless this artefact," I projected, deliberately using the most
sacred speech we know. "Ownerless this entity no ethical being could
ever have possessed. Ownerless this thing that deserved never to be,
never to have come into existence. Now, that we have found it, we
honourably are taking it whither it will cause no harm, we will 
place it where it will be no trouble, we will ensure it is whence it
cannot escape."

"Do you meddling fools not realize whom you are addressing?"

And then it dawned on us. We realized the one and only being in the
universe who could have posed that question in such tones of
authenticity. Now, we perceived as well why it was the grinning
teeth of a skull, which fronted us. Before us stood no ordinary dark
sorcerer, not even just any black magician able to keep his will and
individuality attached to his unnaturally preserved skeleton and
skull. This was the single entity, who had a right to refer to this
abominable book as his property.

"I see," came the telepathic snear of our adversary, "that the
mental might of the great wizards has finally penetrated this simple
truth. Now that you perceive that it is indeed my property, you may
return it to me, and maybe I shall let you continue to exist."

"Your property or your soul?" mocked Blue as she readied an
offensive spell.

Zandala the Black, for who else could it be, though that blackest of
the black magicians in the known universe was said to have died ten
thousand years ago, reached forth to take his book.

Blue's spell visualized as a great fish hook turned into a bubble
and floated towards the ceiling.

"No way," projected Orange, as he hurled himself over the table,
deftly dodging the swiftly swung staff. He pointed a finger at the
huge volume wrapped in the badarn leaf. "You," he commanded, "over
here." From his finger flared and shone a light as orange as the sun
of our world. This pulled the leaf and the book, as though they were
metallic and the vibrant orange ray a lodestone.

"Master!" shrieked the book, as it became aware that it was being
taken further from its creator, in a sense from the other portion of
its own being. It thrashed wildly about inside the huge leaf that
held it imprisoned.

However, Zandala was not to be so easily defeated. The sorcerer, who
ought to have been long dead, raised his left hand in the air.
Around the wrist of that hand glittered a bracelet as black as the
night upon which reposed the representation of a certain vile and
particularly loathsome demon.

"Zhazhsheekhnakhzh!" came the dark spell from the mind of the skull.
Instantly, from the skeleton's bracelet streamed a thick ray of very
black light, if it may be called that.

We watched in horrid fascination as that ray of black light began to
stab through the air, slowly reaching towards the gleaming orange
ray, which held the book in its grip. Our minds quickly swept
through all the permutations and possibilities arising from this
moment, striving to settle on the moves with the greatest chances of
success.

Slowly the two rays of light came into contact. Slowly the orange
ray began to darken, to alter its characteristics, to become indeed
an extension of the ray wielded by Zandala the Black. The Wizard of
Blue was pouring her will into Orange's ray to prevent this and she
was quite evidentally failing. I tried, too, to feed him some of my
own will power and life force. It was clearly not enough. There
could be but one resolution, a single outcome to this battle, if we
persisted. All three of us would be drained of life and the book
would still fall into Zandala's skeletal hands.

Without allowing any time for my resolution to form clearly in my
mind where it might be read by Zandala, I ceased the flow of energy
from my ring of power to the Wizard of Orange who was using it to
bolster his sun orange ray. Immediately, even before friend or foe
became aware that I had halted my participation in the struggle of
rays and wills, I leaped forward. I yanked the book off the table
and jumped behind my two fellow Wizards. Already the orange ray,
deprived of my energy, was close to being completely black.

That lasted for barely a microsecond. Then the colour of the ray
change again. It was once again as brilliant and pure a light as it
had been before the skeletal sorcerer had activated his bracelet and
uttered his incantation. Zandala had decided, quicker than I liked,
that this particular contest, even if it was going in his favour,
was not getting him what he most desired. He raised his wrist, so
that bracelet could fasten directly at me.

However, by the time he could do that, I and the volume he so
understandably coveted, were gone. With a complete disregard of the
need to conserve my energy, I did the only thing that occurred to
me. I willed the door open, and sped through it magically as fast as
I could move my body and the burden I carried. I visualized my
destination and the route through the sky above the city needed to
get there, and left the rest of the ultra swift travelling to my
subconscious mind.

All of my conscious attention I devoted to the increasingly more
difficult task of holding onto the grimoire. It was pulling with all
its might to escape and return to the last place it had beheld its
master. I felt the air around me chilling preternaturally. My hands
felt as if they were holding a huge block of ice. It seemed to
increase its weight enormously. Yet, all of this was as nothing to
another chilling realization that swept through my mind. Zandala had
quitted the structure where he had so recently struggled with us.
All my effort to prevent the telepathic contact of this book with
him was failing. I had barely two seconds.

"Green!" I knew that this faintest whisper barely reaching my mind
through the barrier cast by my awesomely potent pursuer had been
projected as an agonizingly loud psychic wail by the Wizard of Blue.
A poignant sorrow passed over me. I couldn't concentrate enough
energy to project a reply which would reach her.

"Dearest Blue," I thought. And very briefly in the deepest level of
my heart I saw a boat upon the sea beneath the starry sky. 

I arrived at my apartment. I could feel the net John Dee's ghost had
warned of ready to snap shut once I entered the front door. It
mattered not for more than one reason. I sent the mental command to
open the balcony doors of the sixth floor apartment. I darted
through, bearing my captive with me. For perhaps as long as it takes
a human heart to beat once, I rested, attempting to relax and regain
what portion of my energy I could. My ring blazed on my finger. I
felt the matrix of my being, and the wholesome remembrances of all
my predecessors, emanating from this ring.

A great sense of calm flowed over me, a feeling of such peace as I
had never personally felt though I could read from the experiences
offered to me by the ring, that the Wizard of Green had felt this
way before. I stood there holding the dark grimoire between my two
hands, waiting for the confrontation that lay just ahead. I watched
it begin to unfold with a detachment very unusual for me.

I mentally commanded the balcony doors closed, and they closed. I
mentally commanded all the psychic protective spells I had placed
into those doors and the rest of my apartment to be activated and I
sent some of my diminished life force into strengthening them. I
felt the remarkable ease of the analysis, of the focusing in my mind
of every minute aspect of the magical task that lay before me.

I saw the arrival beyond those balcony doors of the black cloaked
skeletal sorcerer. I saw the flashing of emerald energy, as bright
and as swift as lightning, as my wards kept him at bay for three
microseconds. I watched that blaze blacken and fade away. I looked
on as the balcony doors themselves dissolved before my eyes.

Across the threshold, into my apartment, unbidden stepped Zandala
the Black. I could see his skull in no way altered from what it had
been before, though now I perceived with my psychic awareness that
he was absolutely enraged at the effort we had forced him to take to
regain that which, after all, was his, if not, indeed, him.

"Does not my reading here," I projected to him, "include the fact
that no servant of evil can intrude unbidden into the abode of a
righteous person? What, then, is happening? Where is the invitation
to come inside?"

"Meddler, your reading is inaccurate, and even were it true, have I
not been more than merely invited into your miserable den? Have I
not been abducted and carried here against my will? Now, prepare to
die."

I continued to hold the book. Almost one might imagine that I was
presenting my visitor some award, for my hands were reaching out to
him, and between them rested the book he wanted so much. That
unnatural volume had ceased flailing about. True, it was delighted
that its master was so close again. Yet, I could also sense it
trying to figure out what was going on. It was very suspicious of
me.

If his book was quiet and wary of the wizard holding it, this was
not transmitted to the master. What reason had Zandala to be wary of
me? Had he not defeated three of us together, and here I stood
alone? There was no way that I could best him. I was finished.

And now I began the finest game of chess, which I have ever played.
"Yes," I let my mind think and I allowed that thought to reach him,
though some, but deliberately not enough of my fading energy, I used
up in an effort to conceal it. "I am finished. I am going to die
here. Zandala has triumphed and I cannot match his mastery of
magic."

I felt his lightning swift analysis of my confession of his
supremecy. I felt his sudden awareness of my mental calm, of the
sense of determination and heroic death I chose to embrace. He tried
to see the harm in that for himself. Try as hard as he could, he
failed to see any way that I could harm him. All that he could see
was my complete destruction after I had delayed him only a very
small, however frustrating, time.

Again, I allowed him to read my thought that he was completely
correct.

"Such a fool I have seldom seen," he projected to me, as he readied
the potent psychic glyph which would still my heart and solidify my
blood.

I did not comment. Rather, I allowed my mind to compose itself for
my coming death. Now, I began to review the whole of my long life. I
basked in the glow of all that I had done right and felt regret for
all that I had done wrong. I felt the incomprehensible scorn of the
evil entity, that would not admit that it had ever done anything
wrong and surely would never feel apologetic for such wrongs as
troubled me. And the things I took pleasure in seemed to Zandala in
no way worthy of remembering, especially at the hour of death.

I expressed my gratitude to nature or to God for the cycle of life
in this finite and ever changing world. The small seed grows into
the tall tree, which bestows on all the creatures of the woods the
bounty of the shade of its leaves and the fruit of its boughs. I had
grown from the day of my birth, long ago as it had been, into the
adult that now I was. I had lived my life and as the green trees of
my native forest I had tried to provide others with sheltering shade
and beneficial fruit. I was grateful that the universe in which I
had lived had given me that opportunity.

Zandala projected his murderous glyph towards me, and I was amazed
at how slowly it seemed to traverse the distance between his mind
and me.

I thought next, a microsecond long, about the surging of my higher
being above the finite world, even as my comely physical form
disintegrated into the separate molecules and atoms which composed
my body.

I leaped. As this final thought was read by Zandala, who so greatly
feared the concept of death and the disintegration of matter, even
as I felt the initial actualization of the glyph sent to kill me, I
sprang forward. And willing the badarn leaf back to the forest,
whence I'd summoned it, I placed the book into his hands. And with
almost every single erg of energy left to me, I forced deep into his
mind the most powerful weapon at my disposal, the most deadly and
dangerous thing which Zandala had overlooked, the truth.

"We are dead!" I projected. And the mightiest magic, that for
thousands of years had tried to deny reality, could not oppose my
emphatic assertion of what really was.

"No!" he howled. However, his wailing could not change the destiny
his physical form shared with mine and with the physical forms of
all who enter this world. There comes a time when the atoms of our
bodies go their separate ways. So long delayed, the atoms which
continued to hold the skeleton together, now separated with the
utmost rapidity. Just as rapidly that skeleton disintegrated. The
book itself was not immune from this. It, too, speedily began to
fall apart. Soon, all that lay upon the floor was the pile of dust
formed by book and author, now together at last.

And as my eyes closed and I felt myself falling backwards, there
mentally came words which sounded vaguely familiar, "I am very, very
pleased with you."
