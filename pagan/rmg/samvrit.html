1. Prebriefing. We run through the coming rit, so all know what to
expect and everything is prepared.

2. Ringing of Bell Thrice.

3. Procession. There is a procession to the location of the ritual. A
nifty chant could be recited here. "We are walking to the grove" is one
option. Circling the sacred centre three times (deasil, sunwise) feels
likes a sweet thing to do.

4. Gatekeeper:

Manannan, son of Lyr, cherished boatman, kindly bear us across the
misty seas of mystery to the ethereal shores beyond for we have worthy
business there now, as you can perceive in our hearts.

5. Statement of Purpose:

Divining druid:

We have assembled at this very special time, just after a lunar eclipse,
just after a momentous year, just after the arduous efforts to plant the
seed of our by-laws, now on the threshold of the new, of the assertion
of our existence as a provisional grove, of our election at this ritual
of our officers, of another year in the solar cycle, another stage in
our lives, and, we pray, a new, healthy and beneficial epoch in the
history of this planet.

Epona's druid:

We are gathered here and we invite our deities and all benign and
favouring spirits to join us in placing in the care of our sacred tree
our gifts, our hopes, our trust in their support that we may as a
growing grove may constantly, continuously and ever be roots, trunk and
harvest of human harmony.

High One's Druid:

For this reason, to mark the very special nature of this most sacred
ritual of this year, this extraordinary event in our collective lives,
this, we hope, for the greater world around us, beneficial turning point
in human history, we speak straight from our hearts in prose.

Ancestral druid:

Ancestors, we remember you, we respect you, we invite you now watching
over those of us now following along paths you walked, kindly accept
this token of our esteem and join us here. Allow us the favour of your
watchful, able and active attendance.

Natural druid:

You who are the spirits in the world all around us, you who are strands
upon the great web of life embracing this entire planet, you who are so
very much the evidence, the sign, the potency of life upon Earth, along
it's waterways, within the skies of Terra, we remember you, we honour
you, we invite you to come and join us today and grant us the favour of
your able, capable and energizing spirit.

High Ones druid:

You who were the all-known deities of the Celtic peoples, to whom our
pre-monotheistic ancestors communed on a very internal, heart felt and
very real manner, kindly accept this token of our remembrance, reverence
and esteem and, along with any other beneficial high ones wishing well
us, our people, humanity, join us today and grant us the favour of your
able, capable and energizing spirit.

Druid keeping away outdwellers:

If there are any around who are not concerned with what we are are doing
or are even unfavourably disposed to our work here, we ask that you take
this gift and go away from this place.

Divining druid:

We have just invited all of the deities of the Celtic people to attend
and included in this invitation any other deities favourably disposed to
our work. Because of the special nature of this occasion, due to the
extraordinary aspects of this somber ritual, as a consequence of the
astronomical, political and spiritual significance of this time, we now
call especially upon three of the greatest of the divine champions of
our people.

Oghma's druid:

Oghma, god of eloquence, god of wisdom, champion of the gods, we
remember you, we reverence you, we invite you to accept this token of
our respect, to join with us, to favour us during the course of this
ritual, to assist us in the time to come that all of us, all those
dwelling around us, all abiding upon this planet may dwell in health,
happiness and harmony, safe, secure and shielded. 

Lugh's druid:

Lugh, of the many talents, so accomplished in so many skills, you, too,
are a divine champion. We remember you, we honour you. We ask you please
to accept this token of our respect for you, to join us here, to watch
over us benignly during the procedures of this ritual and to safeguard
all of us in the days to come that this grove and all around it and the
planet upon which it is established may be healthy, happy, harmonious,
safe, protected and secure.

Epona's druid:

Epona, spiritual shield defending ancient Celtic cavalrymen, goddess of
birth, goddess of wayfarers from the realm of life, we remember you, we
respect you, we invite you please to accept this token of our esteem for
you, to join us here, to shield us from all who would do us harm from
wheresoever they may be. Epona, please be a strong support for this
grove, for the people living within what used to be this great forest
and for the planet upon which we stand, that we all may rejoice in
health, happiness and harmony.

Individual Offerings.

Natural druid:

This is the time for each one who wishes, beginning in order, one by one
from the direction of the rising sun and in the direction of the sun, to
offer gifts to our ancestors, deities and spirits.

Divining druid does a divination:

Affirmation of Grove Status and Election of Officers:

If the divination does not cause a reconsideration, we now affirm our
status as a provisional grove and elect our executive triad.

Communal Sharing. Here is passed around our communal drink. There may
well be a celebratory and informal time out here.

Epona's druid:

Epona, we are delighted that you accepted our invitation and shared in
our commemoration of this ancient Celtic sacred time. We hope you will
continue to watch over this grove, this former great forest and this
planet so filled with potential, even if you choose to have much of
your attention in otherworldly spaces. Go if you must, stay if you
will.

Lugh's druid:

Lugh, we are very grateful that you came in response to our invitation
and shared in our marking of this very sacred Celtic time. We hope you
will continue to watch over our grove, this former great forest and this
planet so filled with potential benefit, even if you decide to focus
most of your attention on otherworldly matters. Go if you must. Stay if
you will. Thanks again.

Oghma's druid:

Oghma, we are very thankful that you graced us with your presence and
came as invited to be with us as we remembered this ancient Celtic time
of Samhain. We ask you please, even if you must go back to otherworldly
concerns, to continue to watch over our grove, our residue of what used
to be a great forest and this planet standing on the threshold of what
can be a very beneficial time. Go if you must. Stay if you will. A
triple thanks.

High One's druid:

To all the goddesses and gods, all the deities, all the divinities that
accepted our invitation, who came and shared with us on this very
special day, our very special thanks. We are mindful of you and happy
that you are mindful of us. Go if you must. Stay if you will. Very best
wishes.

Natural druid:

To all you spirits all around, all you composing the great web of life,
to you earth, water and air alive, we express our gratitude that you
joined us for this extraordinary marking of the most somber day of our
year. We are mindful of you and thankful you are mindful of us. Go if
you must. Stay if you will. Fare very well.

Ancestral druid:

Ancestors, Grandmothers, Grandfathers, you who lived before us, we thank
you that you came and participated with us at this very special Samhain.
We remember you and we're glad you remembered us. Thanks again for being
here on this special day. All the best.

Gatekeeping druid:

Manannan, thanks for bearing us across the misty waves to the shores
beyond. Time it is for us to return to the realm of mortals.

Divining druid:

We have experienced this day the remarkable wonders of a highly special
Samhain commemoration. We have affirmed our grove's existence, chosen
our executive triad and invoked the protection of our three greatest
Celtic divine champions for ourselves, those who live around us and all
abiding upon this planet. We thank all the mortals who joined with us in
this extraordinary ritual.

Ancestral druid:

Thanks to all. The ritual is ended.
