Introduction to the Solarguard Precis of at Tabari's History

As humanity is a single species, its great attainments are the heritage
of all humans. Their familiarity with their own accomplishments
throughout the human homeworld may enhance their awareness of their
own being.

Among humanity's achievements is the awesome history of Abu Ja'far
Muhammad ibn Jarir at Tabari (839-923) composed in one of the key
surviving languages of the human species.

Besides its great length, its attempt to integrate those remaining
remembrances of humanity's earliest days familiar to the author, its
transmission of significant amounts of quoted verse and cited prose,
this valuable Classic is noteworthy for its extensive statement of the
chains of transmission for the historical facts asserted, as well as
for its effort to retain the memory of the vigorous emergence of one
of humanity's component elements, Islam.

The birth, early days and flourishing of this great tree in the human
grove, is highly significant. As with many human attempts to actualize
inspired kinetic potential, contention for individual leadership and
clashing groups feature predominantly in at Tabari's informative
account.

In the course of time, it is hoped this Solarguard Tabari site may
contain a relatively concise, literary and accurate precis of at
Tabari's entire history. It is hoped that until then this preliminary
and incomplete draft will convey a glimpse of that historian's great
Classic and of the awesome human civilization he presents.
