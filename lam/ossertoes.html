OS SERTOES (REBELLION IN THE BACKLANDS), Euclides da Cunha, transl.
Samuel Putnam, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1944 (Original,
1902).

<p>This has been hailed as the epitome of good Brazilian prose and in English 
this comes through. It almost reminded me of reading translations of Cicero. 
The author, perhaps conscious of Ceasar's GALLIC WAR, starts off with a 
geographical introduction to his history of the religious revolt against the 
forces of the young Brazilian republic. 

<p>In the case of da Cunha, however, this geographical introduction is
quite lengthy and then turns into an account of how the land influenced
the people living there and helps explain how they were inclined to the
religious fanaticism and to the stamina which together with the terrain
so frustrated the efforts of the regular army to put down the revolt.

<p>Many may actually find the introduction of greater interest than the
military history and the author's assessment that this commander was too
rash and that one should have quickly struck at the rebels. Among the
non-military gems are the following:

<p>"According to the testimony of numerous witnesses, the first showers
precipitated from a high altitude never reach the earth. Half way down
they are evaporated between the layers of heated air which are coming up
and so are driven back to the clouds, to be once more condensed, again
precipitated, and to fall afresh in the form of rain. They do not so
much as dampen the ground when they first reach it but very quickly
return to space, being as it were vaporized, as if they had fallen on
incandescent plates. Then they fall again in a rapid and incessant
permutation."

<p>"Maximum and minimum temperatures are recorded at the same time of
year." "Von Martius came this way, with the prime objective of
observing the meteorite which fell on the banks of the Bendego and which was 
already, from 1810, known to European academies through the writings of F. 
Mornay and Wollaston. Making his way through this wild tract, the desertus
austral, as he christened it, he paid little attention to the earth and
the extravagant flora that covered it -- silva horrida in his alarmed
Latin terminology."

<p>"...A vast Cretaceous ocean rolled its waves over the frontier lands
of the two Americas, joining the Atlantic to the Pacific."

<p>There is also the theory he mentions (but rejects as too simplistic)
that the drought cycles observed in the 1700s and 1800s were caused by
sunspot activity. In da Cunha's view, if there is a marked correlation
between solar flare cycles and drought cycles there are also
intermediate causes and other factors.
    
<p>He also refers to prehistoric finds. As well the book should be of
great interest for those enjoying geology and botany.  Da Cunha was writing in 
1902. This gives a certain historical interest to the comments he makes on 
scientific subjects. I know others may also have an interest in military 
history.

<p>However, before proceeding, if I'll ever get there, to the actual
fighting, here's another interesting scientific comment from the turn of
the century: "The studies which have been made of the prehistoric native
races are models of subtle observation and brilliant critical analysis;
and thanks to them, and contrary to the way of thinking of those
capricious builders of the Aleutian bridge, it would now appear to have
been definitely established that the races of the Americas are
autochthonous ones." He goes on to talk about Homo americanus and then
Homo afer and finally, "The aristocratic factor of our own gens, the
Portugues stock, which links us with the vibrant intellect of the
Celt..."

<p>This is from the beginning of his chapter on Man, in which he analyzes
the characteristics of the three races in combination and the effect of
geography on them. One interesting note for those who may be interested
in names, in the description of the role of the Sao Francisco river in
the settlement of that area, da Cunha refers to, "Expeditions to the
mines of Moreya."

<p>The chapter "Man" is more than a hundred pages long. We are shown the
life and hardiness of the backlander, his rounding up cattle, his poetic
challenges, his superstition and the cyclical drought's influence on
him. We next see the family background of Antonio Conselheiro, the
mystical Counsellor, who was the leader of the fanatical rebels. This
presents the feud between his family, the Macies, and the Araujos. Da
Cunha depicts this struggle, with its drama and violence, the courage of
the wronged Macies and the villany of the evil Araujos, with a vividness
worthy of a Hollywood western.

<p>Next we glimpse the young Antonio Vincente Mendes Maciel, a quiet,
timid young man, who through a series of reverses in life ends up
renouncing the world and becoming a wandering holy man.

<p>Then the ascetic attracts a following and exerts a beneficial
influence on a region. "There were the towers of dozens of churches
which he had built; he it was who had founded the settlement of Bom
Jesus, now almost a city; from Chorrocho to Villa do Conde, from
Itapicuro to Geremoabo, there was not a single town or obscure village
in which he did not have his fervent disciples, and which did not owe to
him the rebuilding of a cemetery, the possession of a place of worship,
or the providential gift of a water dam."

<p>However, he disliked new taxes and burned the tax notices and when
thirty policemen arrived to enforce order, Consulheiro's followers
routed them. Then the Counsellor withdrew to Canudos, the centre of his
sect, a town swollen by the arrival of the faithful.

<p>There is the next the interlude of the friar coming to Canudos as a
missionary and attempting to convert the zealots. Consulheiro permitted
him to preach. However, the audience did not keep its disapproval to
itself. "Thus, when the preacher came to deal with fasting as a means of
mortifying the flesh and bridling the passions through sobriety,
without, however, calling for any prolonged self-mortification, but
pointed out that, 'One often may fast by eating meat at dinner and
taking in the morning only a cup of coffee' -- when he reached this
point, his sermon was irreverently and ironically interrupted: 'Why
that's not fasting; that's stuffing your gut!'"

<p>Da Cunha also shares his opinion of the conditions of life in Canudos.
"In the jail...could be seen daily those who had committed the slight
offense of a few homocides, alongside those who had been guilty of the
abominable crime of having failed to be present at prayers."

<p>It is at the bottom of page 178 that we begin to encounter the
immediate causes of the conflict and see how a magistrate of a
neighbouring town breaking his contract to deliver wood to Canudos calls
on the army to defend him from the anticipated attack. And this trivial
beginning, if lumber for the building of a new church can be called
trivial, will eventually lead a succession of armies into the backlands
in the more than three hundred pages still remaining.
    
<p>First, however, da Cunha, who it is said, metaphorically, composed his
work with a liana stalk, reminds his readers of the backlander's
acquaintance with the land and the advantages this will give him in the
coming conflict. "The umbu tree will quench his thirst and give him the
scant shade of its last-remaining leaves; the araticu, the verdant
urucuri, the shapely marizeiro, the quixabeira with its tiny fruit --
all will give him enough and more than enough to eat and drink. The
palmatorias, stripped of their numerous thorns by a process of rapid
combustion, the mandacarus, carved up with a knife, or the leaves of the
juas will serve to keep his horse alive; the juas will also provide him
with a covering for his improvised traveler's couch; the fibrous caroas
afford him strong and supple ropes. And if it should be necessary for
him to continue his journey after nightfall, and in the darkness his eye
is barely able to make out the bluish-phosphorescent glow of the
cumanans, hanging down like fantastic garlands from the tree boughs,
then all he has to do is to light a green branch of the candomba and
wave it in front of him as he goes along the trail, thereby dazzling and
frightening away the pumas with this gleaming torch."

<p>Well, this has already gone on for two and a half pages, so we at
least need a break before we talk about Von der Goltz, Prussian tactics
and draw comparison between fighting in the streets of Canudos and those
of Stalingrad. So, rather than go on at length about trench warfare or
the gaucho lancers or the story of the valiant hero who died alone
guarding his slain general ("This obscure soldier was on his way to a
place in history when -- unfortunate enough not to have died -- he cut
short the immortality that was being thrust upon him by making his
appearance in the flesh, along with the last remaining stragglers, in
Queimadas.") or the Krupp cannons, etc., let's have a change of pace.
