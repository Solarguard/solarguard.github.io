RAINBOW, Michael McKenny

Chapter One Contact

The awesomely vast high forest, the planetary telepathic network,
grew even more swiftly than normal. Every one of its trees flowed
from its normal range and focus of conversation, adding special
rainbow hued leaves, the green band intensely shining. Excited,
poignant, worried, well-wishing came the sincerest thoughts and
emotions of our global population of telepaths. Each projected for
me and the world to read a personal response to my departure.

From five of my colleagues the messages were more subdued. The
Council of Colours had known longer that I was going, and already
these five had sent their most touching thoughts. Yet, they were
here in my mind at this the moment of my leaving. Red was presenting
me with his most updated chart of the neural network of our species
and his hope it would be of use where I was going. Orange was
strumming an ancient Askaran kyola in a meditatively calming manner.
Yellow was eating a Sitoan fish with her ceremonial fork of
farewell. Aged Indigo stood beside a badarn tree, a flitterfy upon
her shoulder, moving her hands to form the word 'thrive,' while in
the shadow of Mount Zhayroon Violet stood at the entrance to her
healing garden holding the livelong herb.

A world of people within my mind, Blue alone stood before my
physical eyes. Behind her began the great azure Sea of Yattashdor,
its waters lapping the sandy shore at the foot of the hill which was
the last spot of my native soil I'd stand on for days, for months.

"How wait, not waste away restraining waves arrayed," she began in
the ancient Southern tongue, projecting a visual of the weeping
heroine beginning her lines in that so sorrowful scene of the First
Empire's most appealing romantic drama.

"I am moved," I projected in our native Forest speech, along with a
visual of the classical hero pointing at his lines, beginning,
"Return to you shall I."

"I'll miss you, Green," she projected. 

"And I'll miss you, Blue," I replied, my heart heavy with the sorrow
of the moment. Around us joywings trilled their praise of the rising
orange sun and two dozen varieties of aromatic herbs cast their
scent upon the breeze. "It is agreed you will receive the reports I
project daily, each time their sun sets and the stars become visible
above me on that distant planet."

"It is hardly the same," she returned along with the picture of a
raindrop hovering above the sea. As this exchange was taking place,
she raised her hand, rearranging the caerulean headband keeping her
long silvery hair from her penetrating blue eyes, and to wipe away a
tear.

"I agree," I projected. "I wish you were coming."

"And distract you from studying that culture and finding the psychic
incongruity," she replied with the visual of a little grampa gowa
laughing. "No, I realize that you are best suited for the task and
you'll work best able to devote your full attention to it."

"Ay-yar willing, my time there will pass swiftly and uneventfully,"
I projected.

"Just don't get so enthralled with all you find there, that you
forget our own prosaic world."

I gazed into her eyes, as lambent and deep as the great sea that
stretched beyond her and smiled. "Blue, I shall include this scene
among my nightly memories. Fear not. I'll never forget you. Every
night I am asleep on that alien world, I'll see you looking at me,
just as you are now."

Within our minds we could feel the unusual stilling of the growth of
the high forest for a moment of global mental silence. Such silence
was a sign of care and respect accorded at the funeral of a wizard.
This first time in history that one of us was going offworld called
forth that tribute and deep concern. I was moved more by that
silence than by the kaleidoscope of verbal and visual imagery I had
just received.

Blue smiled winsomely and seemed about to say something else very
touching. However, just then her lips trembled.

I tensed, puzzled. A shiver passed over my frame.

"Are you cold?" she asked and I was aware the nightly memory was
straying from its regular program.

Then she was shivering and the hill's slope, the seashore and the
waters beyond misted over and grew hazy.

"What in Ay-yar's name is going on?" my slumbering, though stirring,
consciousness thought to my matrix ring. "Why are the scheduled
nocturnal memories being interrupted? What's this other thing
displacing it?"

"Receiving a psychic transmission rated seven point four on the
Goronian scale," came the ring's reply. "Override?"

"No," I commanded mentally. My sluggish semi-consciousness realized
this could be the first real clue to what I sought. "Emerald Defense
now, though. No need to let anyone become aware of me."

One of four dark cloaked figures was reciting something in a field
at night. A breeze carried the pungent odour of incense and caused
five scarlet candles to flicker. I saw those candles stood on the
points of a black pentagram shaped carpet spread out on the grass
between two rows of tombstones.

"O Guardian Spirits of the Night! O Angels Supreme! O Governors of
Mercury now in command! O Sphere of wisdom and mystery and magic now
dominant! O Anubis! O Ferryman of departed souls!"

"How is this banal Terran magic being received so high on the
scale?" I asked my matrix ring.

"Attempting identification. Invisible Terran factor. Ninety eight
point six percent probability this is viewer of authentic dream.
Also, significant possibility, forty eight percent and rising, of
dangerous extraterrestrial factor."

"What? You mean some dreaming Terran is able to project his dream of
some real occult ceremony over my scheduled nightly memory?"

"Yes. He's completely unaware he's doing so. Also, there's now a
fifty three percent probability and rising of a malefic
extraterrestrial factor." The collective expression of the wisdom of
my predecessors which composed the matrix ring was quite concerned.

My slumbering consciousness began pondering whether to come fully
awake. However, would I then lose what was likely my first real lead
to what I had been sent to uncover on Earth?

The cloaked figure continued his recital, "O Thou, Who hast ever
guided those making the journey to the far strands of the spirit
world! We await word from the spirit that departed this mortal
dust."

The unsavoury thoughts of the sorcerer conducting the ritual were
easy to read. In turn he and his colleagues intended to interrogate,
dominate and command the ghost of a murderer, the boatman of the
underworld, the god of wisdom and so on in ever higher spirals,
until they had spoken to and assumed the aspect of all the human
archetypes they believed lay within the sphere of Mercury, and more,
until they were gods, and all tonight.

Then I became aware that the air a few paces away seemed strange,
unnatural. I tried to look at the spot more closely. However, my
eyes were pulled back to the ceremony itself.

"I'd like a closer look at that spot," I commanded the matrix ring.

"Confirm command," replied the ring. "Ninety nine point eight
percent probability we are observing authentic dream. Dreamer
seventy four point two percent likely to awake and detect us if we
attempt to alter viewpoint to conduct analysis. Sixteen percent
probability and rising such analysis will be detected by authentic
malefic non-Terran entity."

"Okay, let's wait and see how the dream unfolds, for now at least."

The one conducting the ceremony had halted and was now staring past
me.

"What is it, Dave?" asked one of the others.

"Don't you see it? We've been answered," he said in a trembling
voice.

"No, I don't see anything. Wait a minute."

Dave looked down at the ground. He was bowing. Then he began
intoning prayers of thanksgiving and praise. He was expressing his
utter submissiveness. So much for any intention of becoming a god
tonight.

The whole scene seemed to lurch.

"What, by the Woods, is that?" I thought to the ring.

"Influence of dreamer. Ninety two point eight per cent probability
of attempted lucid dreaming. He made an effort to reach the city
lights beyond the cemetery, without waking up. It was unsuccessful."

Now I was looking at Dave who was no longer looking at the ground.
He was staring past me, whom obviously he couldn't see. He was
gazing transfixed, rather like a Terran frog mesmerized by a snake.
Mentally, psychically, he was surging with emotion, yet very aware
of his plight and seeking to calm himself and deal with the seething
impotent unbalanced force he felt. I perceived various obscure human
spells passing through his mind as he groped for one which would
break the entity's paralysing grip.

"Ghah," was all he was able to utter.

Suddenly, I felt something like a slithering tentacle of a serpent
or the sticky strand of a spider's web, come oozing into his mind.
At once he hurled his soul from his body in what was more than an
astral projection. To me it seemed a great diamond shaped glyph,
with golden Hebrew letters glowing on it rose into the air.

"Ninety seven point eight percent probability," reported the ring,
"that the sorcerer's soul successfully escaped to begin transition
pending next incarnation."

Then I felt the tentacle thrashing towards me.

"Entity, confirmed powerful extraterrestrial, eighty three point one
percent probability now aware of dreamer," reported the matrix ring.

"Enochian envelope Emerald Rescue Six. Activate. Let's get out and
save the dreamer if we can."

"Activated."

At once the scene vanished. For an instant the disturbed nightly
memory attempted to resume. Again I seemed to be standing with Blue
on the slope of a hill above the Sea of Yattashodor. She was looking
very puzzled.

"Ninety nine per cent probability we and the dreamer both escaped
undetected," reported the matrix ring.

"Green, what's going on?" asked the memory of Blue.

Then the phone rang. Instantly I was fully awake and completely
alert. I grabbed the receiver which lay near my head and pulled it
to my ear. The luminescent numbers on my clock radio read 3:05 AM, a
very peculiar time for anyone to be calling me.

"Hello," I said in a very normal tone.

"Ray Green?"

"Just call me Green."

"Green, this is Kevin O'Meara. I'm sorry to disturb you."

"No problem. What's up?"

"This is probably going to sound weird."

Kevin was a fellow student who had an interest in the occult and
science fiction. We did not move in the same circles, and had little
to do with each other outside of class.

"I saw your face just now when I was awake, just after a dream. It
was more like a nightmare." He paused. I could feel his very
understandable hesitation.

I ensured the Emerald defense was still activated, clothed in
Enochian, so even were it detected my spell would appear native to
this planet. At the speed of thought, I read Kevin's memory of his
dream and this fascinating afterglimpse he'd had of me. His dream
had started before I'd become aware of it, but there was no denying
that this was the same Terran dream which had so forcefully intruded
into my scheduled nightly memories. I also had to accept that it was
a true dream. This had happened. The only questions were where had
it happened, and, more important, when. We could easily have viewed
the impressions of something that had transpired decades ago.

"It's okay," I said out loud. "Since you've gone this far you may as
well tell me the dream."

Although I had instantly read the dream and even experienced most of
it, I couldn't let him know that. My abilities and mission here were
secret.

"And then I ordered myself to wake up," he concluded at last, after
a fairly calm and detailed account. Considering the circumstances,
this was fairly impressive.

"Just in time," I said. I had already decided on the best response.
"That lucid dreaming bit is awesome. It's great to be aware you're
dreaming. This could have made the dream a lot less terrifying for
you. Most of the time you seemed aware that you were in no real
danger, as it was only a dream."

"I guess you're right," he said, though he sure didn't sound
convinced. I couldn't blame him.

"It provided a distance, a double distance, from any feeling of
danger. First, there was your dream self, who couldn't be perceived
by the sorcerers and the demon they invoked. Then there was your
conscious mind telling you that there was no harm as it was just a
dream. Despite your humility there's a good chance that you did
affect the dream more than you realize. Quite possibly this
distance, which includes the fact that you never saw that entity
clearly, only as a dark shadowy tentacle, is the consequence of what
you were consciously willing to happen."

"Very interesting," he said. "I didn't consider that." And, very
clearly, he didn't place much weight on such an interpretation.

"It's not impossible," I said, "that this has some more serious
purpose and meaning. In a way, it's just like a dream about death.
Usually, for the average dreamer, this is an indication of an
awareness, at the level of the unconscious, of a coming change. Yet,
it remains a very good idea, while working with that interpretation,
also to pay attention to health and safety. So, it's probably a good
idea for you to avoid cemeteries, evil magicians and even the
reading of works about black magic. You will agree that, if we apply
normal symbolic interpretation to this dream, there are a lot of
repeated symbols cautioning you against getting mixed up with black
magic. If we take it literallly then the message is still largely
the same. Be defensively minded, and beware of the left hand path."

He saw at once that I suspected him of dabbling in black magic. He
started to stammer something to the effect that he wasn't.

"By the Light," I said interrupting him, "do you think I would be
wasting my time talking to you so early in the morning, if I thought
you really were a black magician? Just be especially on the lookout
for any of their webs or tentacles that could snare you. Just be in
a defensive mode against anyone or anything that may have taken a
special interest in you. It's what I would do myself, if I had such
a dream and probably will anyway, as by this call, you've now linked
me to your dream."

"Everything you say makes sense," he said. I could see that he was
delighted that not only had I faith in his adherence to the right
hand path, but that I took the dream seriously. "Thanks for being
willing to listen at this hour, and thanks a lot for the
interpretation and advice."

"Don't mention it. Take care, and try to sleep during what's left of
the night."

"I'll try," he said, though I could see the internal conflict he
faced between his desire to do that and his yearning to track down
in his books and notes the origin of the ritual and especially of
the entity it had succeeded in conjuring.

"See you, Kevin."

"Bye, Green."

I had been probing psychically ever since I had awakened. My
impressions were no different now than they were then. I doubted
that we were in any immediate danger. It may have been a true dream.
Still, wherever and whenever this real event had transpired, here
and now the Ottawa area seemed absolutely safe and normal. As far as
I could tell, and with something of this intensity I should be able
to tell without even trying, there was nothing of special magical
import transpiring.

I rapidly analyzed the advisability of sending my psychic probe
further. This seemed uncalled for, especially as it appeared the
answer lay not only in a different place, but also in a different
time. From my unconscious sprang the thought that it would be best
to leave any further consideration of the matter until after the sun
rose. This was not only because resting normally in itself would be
a good idea, but also because the magical traditions on this planet
placed a lot of strength in the forces of light when the sun was in
the sky.

My mind was ablur. It was not easy to follow my own advice and fall
swiftly back to sleep. I had to shake off the feeling that a
dreadful doom was about to befall this world, and that this could
only be prevented by me notifying the Council and then getting up
and tracking down the thing in Kevin's dream. Finally, I envisioned
the soothing moonlight shining through the domed roof of the
structure beneath which I most frequently fell asleep. Only then, in
compliance to my will, did my mind cease its near fevered activity
and pass into a peaceful sleep.
