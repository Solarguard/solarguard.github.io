<center>ENDLESS UNIVERSE</center><P>

What you are about to read is brought to you at the special request
of StarWolf, who heard my explanation of why I feel ENDLESS UNIVERSE is
the unintentionally funniest SF novel I have ever read and asked me to
write a review. What follows is not a review, but a short and accurate
summary:<p>

<center>STAR DOZERS</center><p>

— Yes, gentlebeings. May I be of service?<p>

— We are two of the elite space explorers here to pick up some six
week old babies.<p>

— We'll raise them to be trained from the cradle space explorers, just
like us.<p>

— Captain, we aliens charged with looking after the children are
getting bad vibes about this planet. We're not going outside and we're
not letting the kids out.<p>

— Well, you can do what you want. We adult humans will keep poking
around out there.<p>

— Crewman, have you seen the Captain?<p>

— Not recently. Captain, Captain.<p>

— There he is. He's lying down in front of that strange plant. Why,
he's dead, Doc.<p>

— Must have been a heart attack.<p>

— There's one of the children from the nursery. Now we can choose a
new captain.<p>

— Here, little Marina, pick one, just one, of the names out of this
hat. That's a good girl. The new captain is...<p>

— Captain, what are your first orders?<p>

— Well, we'll keep poking around outside.<p>

— Doc, there's someone else dead in front of one of those weird
plants.<p>

— That old man. Must have died of old age. Anyway, I'm fed up with
those stupid aliens. As medical officer of this ship, I order the kids
out to get some fresh air.<p>

— Ahhhh! Help! Ahhhh!<p>

— What the blazes! A dead kid, a dying alien, other hurt humans. Doc,
what's going on?<p>

— Can't figure it out, Captain.<p>

— Well, I'm going to send out some guys in space suits to see if they
can find anything.<p>

FIFTY PAGES after the healthy first captain is found dead in front of a weird 
plant occurs this staggering realization, "So the plants were the danger."<p>

— Another planet. I wonder what it's like.<p>

— The air's alright. We don't need our helmets.<p>

— Ahhhh!<p>
     
— Captain, first landing party wiped out by some disease in the atmosphere.<p>

— Second batch better keep their spacesuits and helmets on.<p>

— Good idea, Captain.<p>

— There, we've decontaminated the spacesuits and the outside of the shuttle 
craft.<p>

— Good. I'll go inside and fiddle with some of the equipment we were
using down there. Ahhhh!<p>

— Drat. Forgot to decontaminate that equipment and the inside of the
shuttle craft.<p>

— Why so glum, Captain?<p>
 
— I don't have enough crewmen. We lost so many in those unavoidable
accidents that even working double shifts it's nigh impossible to keep
the ship flying.<p>

— Wait, Captain, we will be able to keep exploring the universe, after
all. We've just made contact with another ship of trained from the
cradle space explorers. By combining our two surviving crews, we'll be
just able to man one ship.<p>

— Another ship lost, though. I wonder how many of our original hundred
are still flying.<p>

— No, Captain, we won't have to lose a ship. We're going to do
something revolutionary. We're going to take on three dozen adult
volunteers from that planet over there and train them to be space
explorers.<p>
