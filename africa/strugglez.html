The Struggle for Zimbabwe, David Martin and Phyllis Johnson, Monthly
Review Press, London and New York, 1981

The acknowledgements on page iv thank many directly involved in the
independence movement.

The foreword on pages v-vi is by Robert Mugabe. He notes the very good
research of the authors and says this volume will be a worthy companion
to those written by people directly involved.

The preface on pages vii-vii states settlers intransigence forced the
struggle.

1. "The Great Illusion" (1-20): On December 21, 1972, Ian Smith praised
Rhodesian race relations and a White farm was shot at. Guerrillas had
been in the area for a year. They'd come by way of Mozambique, where
Rhodesian troops were covertly fighting.

   Rhodesian intelligence officers divide the war into three phases.
   The first lasted from 1964, after Zambian independence when
   guerrillas began to infiltrate across the Zambesi River, to the end
   of Operation Excess, the last consequential action in Mashonaland in
   1968. The second phase was the lull until the attack on Altena Farm
   at the end of 1972. The third, or decisive phase, followed ZANU's
   reassessment. It encompassed a rapid escalation of the war and
   several international attempts to achieve a negotiated settlement,
   and it ended with the ceasefire agreement signed on 21 December 1979.

In January 1969, leaders of seven national liberation movements met in
Khartoum. ZANU had not been included. However, its eagerness to
struggle gained it the unofficial support of Mozambique's FRELIMO.

2. "Some Vakomana" (21-34): Some of the "boys" are introduced. The
Itumbi training camp in Tanzania operated from 1964 to 1971. There were
close ties with Mozambique's FRELIMO. Some trained in China and learned
the importance of gaining popular support over the long term.

3. "Deception, Invasion and Repression" (35-50): Deceitful treaties had
been signed in the 1800s. In 1890 settlers came in force: seeking gold,
seizing land and forcing people to work for them. Both Matabele and
Mashona, despised by Europeans, rose and inflicted heavy casualties
before being suppressed.

4. "Sowing the Seeds for Revolution" (51-72):
