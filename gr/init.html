Initial Thoughts on the Western Classical Tradition.

In the fullness of time, ideally in the Chinese language, my
crowning work will be Fragrant Garden. That work will be the
fullest extent of my spirit's capacity to express the future
potential of humanity.

These few words now seek to present a balanced assessment of the
ancient Greek and Roman foundation of Western society. Humans may
well be embarassed at the extent to which any unbiased analysis
concludes the species is significantly replicating patterns from
the past. Fragrant Garden will more closely examine the extent to
which such instinctive or little considered decision making comes
from before the existence of humans, from so early in evolutionary
time as to predate the species.

Specifically, however, the Greeks and the Romans present patterns
of behaviour that have been consciously imitated in later Western
societies. In addition, perhaps, some Western assumptions may
unconsciously derive from the Greeks and the Romans. Of course,
generalizations are imprecisely correct and exceptions to them can
well be advanced. However, in general, I believe, the remarks below
are accurate.

The Greeks transmitted to later Westerners a share in the emphasis
on individualism. The Golden Mean (Balance) is also a Greek ideal.
However, Westerners, as other humans, have had enormous difficulty
realizing this ideal. One of the most blatant failures of Western
societies has been in an excessive individualism, an astounding
disregard for fellow human individuals and for the community as a
whole.

Greeks and Romans both provide a template of excessive reliance on
force to resolve differences. The Western experience is markedly at
variance from the Chinese realization expressed in San Guo that the
Empire divided comes together and the Empire united dissolves. This
is a key scientific understanding: atoms combine, forming ever more
complex entities, and complex physical structures dissolve. History
in China is a pattern of a succession of dynasties. The West views
the fall of the Roman empire, never re-established, though there has
been a succession of strong states.

It may thus be more natural for modern Westerners, especially those
so strongly influenced by emphatic individualism and a worldview
that focuses on divisions and conflict, to feel instinctively, if
this may be so expressed, that future world history automatically
will unfold as the domination by this or that country. The power
plays of personalities and competing companies and political parties
within and among countries is reminiscent of such conflict in Rome,
as well as within and among the Greek city states.

In moderation, concern for individuals, appreciation of the artistic
achievements of specific poets, prose writers, sculptors, painters,
musicians, etc. is good. Recognition that there is a limit to such
appreciation and that equally the society as a whole deserves great
consideration appears to be a fundamental challenge for the West.

This has been a quick composition, underlining a problem with an
assumption of the correctness of little restrained individualism.
It ought to be mentioned that awesome diversity is possible without
the level of conflict so observable in Western societies. It is not
diversity that is the problem, as I perceive it. The problem is the
assumption that individuals may legitimately oppose other people,
even pursue personal gain at the expense of the entire community.

A Western contentious attitude may be traced at least as far back as
the Greek and Roman foundations of Western societies.

This little essay may well be enhanced in the course of time. As I
see it, a major challenge confronting contemporary Westerners is to
overcome assumptions connected with how natural are competition and
conflict, to strive to an awareness that co-operation also is a
natural aspect of humanity. Further, the very concept of human, all
members of the human species, humanity as community, remains for the
Westerner, as all others, to attain.
