<h1>Latin America</h1>

Last updated on April 28, 2008 C.E. with the completion of the precis of Piero Gleijeses's Conflicting Missions, this site also contains other material on the vast region of Latin America. This includes three files on Brazil, the largest and most populous country in the vast area. That highly complex and diverse nation has contributed richly to world literature, to inter-racial understanding and to every worthy human endeavour. This site also presents Michael McKenny's review of a book on Simon Bolivar and links to several interesting Latin American webpages.<p>
