RAINBOW Michael McKenny

Chapter Ten Fellowship

"This time since there's no pressing need, we'll use ordinary means
of transportation," I said. "A number 2 bus will take us only a
couple of blocks from where we're staying. It's just an ordinary
ground floor apartment in an old house."

"It's Blue's place?" Kevin asked. That was a good guess since I'd
said Orange had arrived from out of town.

"In a manner of speaking," she replied. "I think of it as mine and
Green's, but there are two extra rooms right now where you and
Orange can crash."

"Well, what do you say?" asked Orange.

I could sense the wave of various thoughts swirling through Kevin's
mind. On the one hand, he was very interested in learning more about
us. On the other, he was somewhat in awe of us. The thought popped
into his mind of Macgregor Mathers, a founder of the Golden Dawn,
describing the masters as beings of such energy a normal person
might not survive the experience of close exposure to one.

"Poppycock," I said out loud and he looked at me.

"Last time I read my history," I said, "no one died because he
happened to be too close to Buddha, Jesus or any of the rest of the
holiest ones on Earth, at least in the sense Mathers used. He wasn't
talking about martyrdom. I have a very hard time accepting the
concept that if you run into someone who is highly evolved in a
psychic or spiritual sense, then your physical health is in great
danger."

"But Mathers..." he began.

I cut him off seeing what was in his mind. "I think Mathers was just
trying to cover up the fact his inspiration, remarkable as it was,
had run dry with the Adeptus Minor ritual. The supposedly higher
evolved members of the GD were agitating for higher ranks and
Mathers had to justify not handing them out. It's part of the same
thing that saw him living in Paris, where he was removed from casual
contact with the ordinary members of the order in England. It's a
well known axiom of imperial rule, favoured a lot by those less
adept at ruling, that people are apt to place a lot more trust in a
remote monarch than one whose warts and blemishes are all too
closely visible. His secret chiefs, I believe, are all part of the
same thing."

"You do read minds," said Kevin.

"Usually, only surface thoughts," I replied. "I think what you need
is to see me in a more normal setting outside class. That will shake
off a little of the excessive awe you have about masters, or at
least cure you of the notion that I am one. It will do you good to
come with us."

What flickered through his mind was that he would really be
fascinated and thrilled to come along with us. It was much more than
simply a matter of being protected. Here were people who knew so
much about the topics of deepest concern to him. The one distraction
was the magnetic personality of Blue. However, he was steeling
himself, and visualizing the perfect balance of the seventh and
eighth qabalistic sephiroth in an attempt to control that.

"Do you think he can really handle his physical attraction for you,
Blue?" projected Orange.

Blue projected a mental shrug. "It's hardly my fault. I took care to
assume only a mediocre appearance, and I've made it as clear as I
can that Green and I are together."

"He's an unusually perceptive adept," I projected. "It's not so much
your physical form here that he's attracted to as the real esoteric
self."

"Or at least," she projected, "the concept that I'm an apparently
young female, who is obviously an adept, if not a master."

Orange beamed the image to her of an old woman with grey hair and
wrinkles. "That would cure him pretty fast."

"It might cure her of me, too," I projected with a mental smile.

"I'll have you understand that I've earned every one of those grey
hairs and each of those wrinkles."

"Green," projected Orange, "you know these Terrans better than any
of us. Do you think we've a problem?"

"They're not that much different from us in this respect," I
replied. "There is more sexual frustration. However, there's a lot
more strength in handling it. And I think Kevin, with his focus on
balancing the different aspects of his being through the disciplines
of the right hand path, is one of those most likely to deal with it
in a healthy manner."

"Good," projected Orange. "Anyway, we can monitor his mental well
being and take action if it proves too much for him."

"Agreed," affirmed Blue and I together.

By this time Kevin had thought through his answer to the spoken
question. "I'd be happy to come. For one thing, I'm kind of looking
forward to checking out your library."

"There are a lot of books I haven't moved over yet, but I hope
what's there will interest you," Blue said.

"I don't recall there being much of interest in the apartment,"
stated Orange beaming a visual of bare walls and empty bookcases.

"That's from your point of view," projected Blue. "We all know the
Terrans are not very advanced in your areas of expertise."

"Not exactly true," I projected. "There's an enormous variety here,
possibly even more so than there is back home today. Had Orange been
our observer for the past nine and a half weeks the Council and the
High Forest would probably have already received home reams of
material on the magical folk music of many of the primitive tribes,
to say nothing of Gregorian, Hindu and Sufi chants. Don't form hasty
conclusions because of my focus on my interests."

Orange beamed the visual of someone playing an intricate stringed
instrument popular along our northwest coast. "We have great
variety, too, Green, as you'd realize, if you didn't spend all your
time pouring over ancient Southern manuscripts."

I sent the visual of my hands held straight out, palms towards the
ground. Then I showed them raised above the head, moving from our
archetypical image of yielding to the Terran one. "Peace. All I
wanted to say is that this planet has rich variety."

"If you like the place so much, Green," projected Blue, "I'm sure
it'll be very dear to my heart, too."

Aloud, to Kevin I said, "I'm sure you will find some of them worth
looking at."

I saw the thought flicker across his mind that the most interesting
things he'd learn would probably be those he could coax us to share
with him, the unwritten qabalah, as it were, if he could only
convince us he was ready to receive it.

"Well, now that we've settled that," said Orange, "let's not dally
around here. And, I, for one, disagree with Green. I don't see any
point waiting for a bus and then creeping across town when Kevin's
already seen us use a more practical and secret means of getting
around."

Since we'd already thrashed this out telepathically, while Orange
was saying his first sentence, and apart from getting teased about
wanting to conceal his forest ranger costume, he'd had no trouble
convincing me and Blue, we didn't say anything out loud.

Kevin nodded. "I'm ready," he said. "You can..." and he halted,
because we were already in that apartment which had been shown to
Blue and Orange by the spirit of John Dee.

There came into my mind the visual of a giant sea shell sitting at
the entrance to Blue's cave. This was followed by one of an
intricate tapestry hanging undisturbed over the door to the Tower of
Orange.

"Delighted," I projected to my two fellow wizards. Then to Kevin I
said aloud, "We've just verified that our wards are in place
undisturbed. This dwelling is magically welcoming us to enter safe
and secure."

"Many thanks," he said, a bit hesitantly. Then he made a motion with
his right hand which I realized was a mystic sign of sharing company
and companionship under arms.

"Well done," said Blue, and Orange nodded.

I saw Kevin's eyes take in the room at a glance and linger at the
bookcase against the far wall.

"You're welcome to take a closer look," said Blue, "but since this
is the most open room in the place, most of the books in it are
ordinary or sort of, including science fiction and fantasy."

"I've an idea," I said, "We could take advantage of the fact that
you make four of us, and play a game of Enochian chess."

Kevin said, "Well, I know some people have reconstructed the game,
but I've never played it, nor studied their rules."

"That's alright," said Orange. "Neither have I. My interests are
more in the direction of Hindu and Sufi musically induced trances,
along with half a hundred other things. Green is our Enochian
expert."

Meanwhile Blue had beamed me, "You didn't say anything about four
handed Enochian chess? All your reports passed through my mind, so I
couldn't have missed it. Why did you leave that out?"

"Possibly I was a bit preoccupied," I replied, "and possibly I
wanted to save it as a pleasant surprise for the first attractive
female wizard from home to visit me on this planet."

"Well, I am surprised and pleased," she projected.

As I explained the rules and the game got underway, we talked with
Kevin about his interest in certain qabalistic paths, about Roman
concepts of magic, and, in a general way, about basic principles of
musically induced trances. Blue said little out loud, though we
warmly shared thoughts about all sorts of things, while we looked
into each other's eyes across the table.

At the beginning of the game Kevin, when it was explained to him
that this was a team sport and that Orange was to be his partner,
had asked, "What's to keep you and Blue from sharing thoughts
telepathically?"

"Nothing at all," I said. "We do it all the time. There's also
nothing wrong with reading the thoughts of the other person on our
team in this game. As to me reading your thoughts about the game,
there is a little matter of ethics. This is hardly the game that
encourages cheating, at least not by those of us who aspire to tread
the right hand path."

"But," said Kevin, "that gives you and Blue an advantage."

"Not so much as you think," said Orange. "I can read your mind, and
with your permission, I can imprint my thoughts on your mind, which
will make it feel the same to you as though you were reading mine."

"You've got my permission," said Kevin who was clearly thrilled with
the concept. "I must say, though, that this is hardly the way to
convince me that you're ordinary people."

I laughed. "I never said that. I just said that we weren't beings to
whom it was dangerous to be exposed."

"Maybe this Mathers," projected Orange, "received his inspiration
from radioactive robots."

Blue and I beamed a smile to him.

With all the attention I devoted to Blue and to the game, I still
observed Kevin with great interest. There was a wholesomeness to
him, a light that shone through his eyes, a healthy vitality,
strength and resilience which deeply impressed me. I was surprised,
while I was thinking this, by the brief stirring of my matrix ring.
All it did was project an image of Earth's yellow sun with a smile
across it. Then it was still.

"What does that mean?" I asked it.

"Everything," it replied, and I realized that this was one of those
times when it would not communicate less cryptically.

I could sense that Blue had followed this and asked her, "What do
you make of it?"

"Only that your great admiration for this alien world increases my
admiration for you."

Of course, it would have been unethical for me, the only one who'd
known about this game before we sat down to play it, to be on the
winning team. Kevin was delighted more at what the game taught him
about elemental tables and correspondences than he was by the fact
that he and Orange won.

"This is really awesome," he said when it was over.

"I'm glad you liked it," I said with a smile.

"I did, too," said Orange. "Thanks."

"I never really thought I'd be playing this game," said Kevin. "I
mean I knew about Yeats playing it with Mathers, the wife of Mathers
and a spirit, and I'd heard some people were reconstructing it. It's
just I never really imagined I'd be a part of that, like, you know,
scene."

"Yes," I said with a smile. "Well, I'm not sure how compatible this
version is with the reconstructed one. I, uh, may not have got their
version of the rules down pat."

"Meaning," projected Blue, "that you crafted this one yourself."

I beamed her a visual of a smile and projected, "I thought you would
like it and somehow missed this bit about the modern reconstruction.
I should have known that would happen."

"Wait till we tell the others about this," projected Orange. "If
ordinary Terran chess is considered such fun, then this esoteric
four handed version of it will really shake the leaves."

"We can adapt it," suggested Blue, "to fit more exactly into the
Gvihlih-lihn world view and use it as a teaching tool."

"I've already been pondering that," I projected. "If you want I can
beam you what I've come up with to date."

She beamed a smile visual in reply. "I'm looking forward to it, but
later. You and I have other things to share right now."

"Wow," said Kevin, continuing the spoken conversation, "imagine me
playing the game, or one similar, that they were playing in the
Golden Dawn more than a hundred years ago."

I could see the thoughts as they flowed through his mind. He was all
set to move in, join the order he imagined we belonged to and devote
his life to the study of magic with us. Somewhere in there was the
image of a girl, sort of like Blue, her sister maybe, or another
young female in the order.

"Very touching," projected Orange who had also read it. "Too bad
that we're going to have to disappoint him."

"I'm not so sure that we will," I projected. "Even if many of his
detailed impressions are wrong, he may not be that far off when it
comes to how the future will turn out for him. He has the makings of
a great ally, even after this present task is finished. I'm not so
sure, now that I've seen the place, that I can just go home and
forget about this planet."

"I can see your point," projected Orange, "though it's one frankly
that never occured to me before."

Blue beamed the visual of a lovely pink egg. It changed and became
the picture of the globe of our world. Slowly, it cracked open and
first a green ray shone out, then a blue and orange one joined it,
and finally all seven rays were shining into space.

"We have dwelt so long on our world alone, barely attentive to the
affairs of the Federation and the rest of the Galaxy," she
projected.

"Well," projected Orange, "it's only two hundred and forty years ago
the Federation established contact with us, and I'd hardly call the
twelve to the power of six or whatever trees in the high forest
dealing with other worlds and the Federation 'barely attentive.'"

"Two hundred and fifty eight years," I stated more precisely with a
beamed visual of eighteen orange suns enthusiastically waving arms
and calling out, "Don't forget about us." "I can tell you from a
Terran viewpoint that's not recent at all. They feel what happened
in the last decade is old. Blue is right. It's a question of
relativity. Yes, we have all these messages posted in our high
forest about other worlds, but still we wizards have had so much to
occupy our attention back home it never occured to us actually to go
and check out one of these other planets. Now, that I've been here
and started really to experience the place, I'm almost overwhelmed
by its variegated wonders."

"Well," projected Orange, "creation is filled with wonder."

Here Blue cut in. "This little high tree could grow quite a bit, but
Kevin's been waiting a second or so for the continuation of the
spoken conversation."

I laughed mentally, and carried that laugh over to the verbal
discussion. "Yes," I said. "I got distracted in a telepathic thread.
Kevin, forgive me for having my mind elsewhere. I'll make it up to
you by going with you and giving you a running commentary of some of
the worthwhile esoteric books here."

"Uh, no problem," said Kevin. "I'd be very interested in seeing
them."

"Okay," I projected to Blue. "Beam me your file of titles and
locations. I haven't looked at these myself remember. There's got to
be some, though, if there really are magicians living here."

"There are, and here it is," projected Blue with a smile.

"We may as well check what's in Orange's room first," I said.
"You'll have all night to examine the ones in yours."

As the two of us walked into the room which Blue had indicated was
Orange's, I was observing Kevin's surface thoughts. He was
energized, sort of on a high. I stood back a bit and let him roll
his eyes over the books in one of the two bookcases there.
Immediately, he inhaled sharply.

"Look at this," said Kevin. "I've only read about it and here it is.
I thought Blue said most of her good stuff was still at her parents'
place."

That was not literally true, though her words might have given that
impression.

"Actually, this is the room of another magician, who is away for the
week."

Something in my tone must have caught his extra-sensory attention.
He swung around, the book still partly opened and said, "Then, we
won't be staying here long."

"I already mentioned that Orange is from out of town. The order, if
you want to call it that, is very interested in you. We feel that
you may have more to do with solving this situation than you can
guess. This doesn't mean that we don't have class tomorrow, nor that
Orange, Blue and I shouldn't proceed sometime tomorrow, while the
sun is still in the sky, to upgrade the wards you have at your
apartment."

He smiled at the mix of modern computer and traditional magical
terminology. I could see that his thoughts were tinged with sadness
that the dream of just entering the order, almost as one may enter a
monastery, though that image was not entirely accurate, was a bubble
bursting in the air. Still, he had fastened a firm mental grip on my
reference to the order's interest in him and his role.

I spent eight minutes pointing out some of the especially good books
with which he was not familiar. Then I said, "Let's rejoin the
others. I think you've got enough to keep you busy for the rest of
the evening, even without counting what's waiting for you in the
room you'll be using. Just make sure you put back any book exactly
where you found it."

"Will do," said Kevin. "I'm looking forward to reading this," he
added, indicating the first one he'd found on entering Orange's
room. "I wonder what the chances are that I could borrow it."

"There's seldom any harm in asking. And one of the normal
characteristics of a true adept is his willingness to share what he
knows, to make it easier for those treading the path a little behind
him, just as his way was made easier by those advancing along the
path ahead of him. As I understand it, the person who owns the book
will be back in a week or so. We can come sometime after that and
see about you borrowing it or reading the book here, if there's too
great a reluctance to lend. No promises, but I think the odds are
pretty good."

"Great," said Kevin, his eyes all aglow.

By this time we'd arrived back in the living room.

"I can see," said Blue, "that you've found something."

"Yes," said Kevin abstractedly and we three wizards exchanged
telepathic smiles.

"I think," Blue projected to me, "we can take our leave."

"Go ahead," projected Orange. "I'll take care of Kevin." Out loud he
said, "Kevin, there's some fruit and juice in the fridge. I'd be
happy to get you some. It's not much, but it's nutritious which
means a lot more than many people realize."

"Sure," said Kevin. "Whatever you have is fine by me."

"Well, we'll call it a night," I said. "See you."

Orange nodded at us, and Blue and I took our leave, wishing him and
Kevin a good night.

I followed her to the room we were to share. Someone had painted a
fairly good Egyptian styled Hermes on the wall to the right of the
door.
