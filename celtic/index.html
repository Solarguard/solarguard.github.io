<h1>Celtic</h1>

The early Celts had a truly awesome civilization: oral, individualistic, heroic, 
astonishingly artistic. At present, this site offers Michel Boucher's essay on Irish Literature (in two parts) and his essay "Celtic Mythology", Michael McKenny's reviews, some quite substantial, of seventeen Celtic books, a look at the game fidchell or hnefetafl and links to the Daltai and Summerlands Irish learning pages. Other Celtic related material, including on ogham divination, may be found under pagan and under poetry can be read a three part tribute to Irish poets. In addition the poem there "Patricia and the Bear" is written in traditional Irish form. Solarguard Celtic was last updated on April 10, 2008 C.E. with rearrangement and categorization of files.<p>
