Soar with the wings of a bird through the sky.
Rise to such heights as they have never dreamed.
In darkest space what glimpses of glory gleamed.
Arise, O mankind. Surge where birds don't fly.

Gaze down on blue Terra's silvery sheen,
Our marvellous planet at one glance seen.
Even an eagle yearns for such a view,
Our triple gemmed jewel arrayed before you.

Still you venture into a new strange sea,
A sea that stretches for eternity.
As the ancient hardy sailors of old,
Into this unknown plunges the most bold.

But your whole planet watches you who go.
The hopes of a world ride with you to space,
And shudder at the dangers that you face.
So wonder not now that seas of tears flow.
Michael McKenny July 4, 1971

This poem is dedicated to cosmonauts Georgi Dobrovolsky, Vladislav
Volkov and Viktor Patsayev who died June 30, 1971 while landing
after twenty four days in space.
