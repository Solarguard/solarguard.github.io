<H1>At Tabari</H1>

This special at Tabari subsection was created on March 15, 2007 C.E. Previously at Tabari files had been placed directly on the main Islamic page. However so impressive a work as at Tabari's voluminous history well deserves this separate subsection. It begins with some dozen or so files summarizing the first thirty four volumes of the English translation of at Tabari and an introduction to these. This was last updated on September 2, 2007 C.E.<p>
