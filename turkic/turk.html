LORDS OF THE HORIZON, Jason Goodwin, Henry Holt and Company, New
York, 1999 (1998).

It is a shame that so splendidly written a book is not wholly 
reliable. It reads like the praise of one in love. The rhythm of 
the prose is captivating, and I found myself reading it aloud, even
when other people were present. The author is surely a poet and it 
is a real treat to quaff the product of his pen.

Alas, even so great a lover of the spoken word as I must confess
that the romance of history includes accurate information. So, if
one already knows the topic, go ahead and imbibe this tastiest
Turkish coffee. Otherwise, it would be better to seek out a more
reliable introduction to Ottoman history.

Among the data incorrect, as I understand it, are: the translation on
page 140 of the name Tamerlane that is unaware, it seems, that leng
means lame, the curious explanation on page 6 that the Shia consider
legitimacy through the line of Ali (this is fine), while the Sunni
consider legitimacy through the line of Fatima, seemingly unaware
that she was married to Ali, and had no descendants who were not
also his.

He is especially treacherous on dates, the building blocks of
history. In at least one place a character is described as doing
something in a given year, and then proceeding to do something else
in another stated year, regretfully several years prior to the first
one, suggesting Ottoman use of time machines, the imperfect
legibility of the author's handwriting for a typist imperfectly
cognizant of Ottoman history, or the author's composition of this
poetical work from frail human memory imperfectly verified. On page
150, Constantine is said to have "founded" Constantinople in 376,
quite a feat for an emperor who died in 337.

It remains a delightful piece of writing, a wonderfully sympathetic
treatment of a fascinating period of history, even though historical
information in the book is not necessarily accurate.
