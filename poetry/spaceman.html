A SPACEMAN's SONG

Oh once I was a spaceman who soared through the skies.
Ceaselessly and joyously we crossed the darkness.
Now only a memory through the spaces flies.
Now others fly my ship to find what no one knows.

Memories are real things that shall never fade.
So once again I reach for adventurers food,
And pilot my spacecraft toward the shiny stars.
Onward to its destination our starfleet steers.

Four searching captains sailing as we did before
Straight into the unknown, so distant, so far.
If I look 'round can I see my own point of light,
Whose gentle world I've not seen these few years of late.

Oh what will it look like when I return again.
What does it matter, for all I know will be gone.
For a year down there up here passes in an hour.
Still how could I choose to be anywhere but here.

Soaring through the spaces between the tiny suns,
Viewing with these mortal eyes celestial scenes,
Alone with the stars, should we gaze in front, behind,
we witness the wonders of the Creator's hand.

We've seen races spring to life and others pass on.
We hurry. There's a thousand worlds we must see soon.
Though emperors have come and gone and still I fly.
The stars themselves are laughing for I am the fool.

For soon this spaceman will cease to soar through the skies,
Ceaselessly and joyously crossing the darkness.
Soon only a memory through the spaces flies.
Soon others fly my ship to find what no one knows.

Here's a song for a world I cannot see.
Here's a love for a race I cannot know.
Here's feeling for a place I cannot go.
Yet with joy I sing for you yet to be.

Here's a song of the gladness of my heart.
I would have talked to you and told you tales.
I would have listened as I roamed you trails,
Of your joy, of your laughter, of your art.

I'd have sailed to see your world strange and new.
These frail eyes would have basked in your splendour,
Warmly reaping chronicles of grandeur.
I'd have loved to walk your world to meet you.

O you peoples of a distant planet,
You know how close and yet how far away,
For I stand singing long before your day,
My world torn, troubled, ununited yet.

Yet perhaps as the wind whispers at dawn.
In the melodies of fading starlight,
You will feel something from this distant night
Of my song of love ever rushing on.
