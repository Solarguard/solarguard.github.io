Ogham is the designation of the original alphabet of the Irish. As the review below of the SCHOLARS' PRIMER notes, it can be suggested that this may have been used for divinatory purposes a millennium ago, if not earlier. It is at least used for such purposes today. At present Michael McKenny's initial ogham understandings in prose and verse, and his alternate history short story, "The Ogham Dance," as well as his reviews of five texts, including THE SCHOLARS' PRIMER, are included in this site. In addition, links are provided to other ogham sites on the web. This was last updated on August 22, 2004 C.E. with the addition of Michael McKenny's ogham verses for kids written at the suggestion of Wry Jones of ADF's Bardic Guild.<p>

10. and 11. Rob Barton has been posting some interesting material on ogham, largely derived from THE SCHOLAR'S PRIMER to the ADF Celtic list. And, Puck,
Heather Chappelle has produced a splendid private work, a magnificent synopsis in 100 plus pages of material drawn from THE SCHOLAR'S PRIMER and a number of other sources, including works dealing with health, incense, dyeing, herbalism, etc. along with a meditative consideration of each few. This is a real tour de force, and, in my opinion, indespensible for anyone interested in the topic. One of the goals of this site is to provide access to these works. You can try Rob Barton's through the ADF page, linked at the top of Solarguard homepage. Puck's Page has been down for some time.<p>
