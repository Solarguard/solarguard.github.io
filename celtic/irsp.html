Celtic Spirituality, transl. Oliver Davies and Thomas O'Loughlin,
Paulist Press, New York, 1999

James Mackey's Preface (pp. xv-xxii): underlines the imminent nature
of Celtic spirituality, notes Christian correspondences of Pagan
Celtic spirituality and points out that particular Celtic expression
can be included in the harmony of a universal Christian church.

Introduction (pp. 1-61): Celtic art evidences a distinct, brilliant
and rich civilization, closely connected to nature and highly
respectful of the word. Those described here as Celts may not have so
self identified, especially with Classical and modern romantic usage
of the designation.

Varied understandings of Celtic Christianity extend from Reformation
times to the present. Different views of church organization vs a
spiritual collective support debates over continuity. Celtic
spirituality existed, felt the feminine, the natural, the resonance
of the Trinity and was exuberantly life-affirming.

Pagan Celtic religion was local, natural, oral, responsive to sacred
triads. Those aspects influenced arriving Christianity.

There were Irish Christians before Patrick. The earliest church
canons contain many references to pagan practises, indicate the
church was organized within existing tribal basis and not integrated
into the larger society.

Late Sixth Century leaders exemplify learning and asceticism.
Columcille founded highly influential Iona. Columbanus, an exile for
Christ, founded monasteries in Western Europe. The Eight Century
Ceili De movement inspired renunciation, hermeticism and a harvest of
spiritual poetry.

Britain's Christians, active since at least the mid Third Century
were impacted by invasions. The organized church survived in the west
of the island.

The sources: hagiography (Patrick, Brigit, Brendan, David, Beuno,
Melangell), monastic, poetry, devotional, liturgy, apochrypha,
exegesis, homilies and theology are outlined.

The texts chosen are a small portion of what survives and were
selected as highlighting distinctly Celtic spirituality.
