Stone Age Business

The armchair warriors rage,
Death dealers are shaking hands,
The same old Tory story,
Shopping with bloody money.

To peoples around the world
Insults and bullets are hurled,
So the Empire's safe and sound,
So more markets may be found.
Who cares for the foreign ground?
Who sees a burial mound?

Time wheels stuck in the Stone Age.
Reborn in the money lands,
The same ancient dynosaurs
Doing business birthing wars.
