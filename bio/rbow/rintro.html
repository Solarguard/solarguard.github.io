RAINBOW, Michael McKenny

Rainbow is a fantasy novel in a modern setting, told in the
traditional and captivating cadence of archetypical myth. The 
story starts with an interstellar agent in the guise of a human
student investigating a magical anomaly on Earth. From that dark
dream opening pulses the book's cyclical pattern of threatening 
darkness and beneficial illumination. The setting includes
extensive esoterica, historical and invented, Terran and alien. 
This pattern intensifies stage by stage into the climactic cosmic
confrontation of light and darkness. It is a tale resonant to the
human psyche, told in a manner and detail designed to appeal to 
readers of traditional fantasy, those of curious and inquiring 
attitude, those yearning for youthful empowerment, for contact 
with beneficent aliens and for a brilliant resolution of the 
problem of evil.
