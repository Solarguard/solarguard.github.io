Chapter Seventeen Confrontation 

We were not to get it. As soon as we were beginning to heave our
collective sigh of relief, that the ultradimensional creatures had
been sent back where they belong, our minds, no longer concentrating
on that problem, became all too aware of another and far more
serious one.

The images, and even the fake television broadcast, had not been
totally false. They had been, even as we knew at the time, a clear
indication of the intention of our adversaries. Now, the masterful
complexity of their designs was revealed before our tired and weary
mental gaze. While we had spent our energy moving a mass of the
cattle, as it were, of that other dimension back to the old mine,
while we had used our resources and our time to close down that
passageway in the mine, the intelligent dwellers of that other realm
had come forth in large numbers, determined to conquer completely
this planet and turn it into a stepping stone in their seizure and
domination of this entire space time continuum.

Now it was not faked and contrived mental impressions which we
received in our enemies' hope that they could trick us to leave the
North American continent. Now with all the psychic clarity we
possessed we beheld the terrifyingly real scenes of black flies
flying through yet another interdimensional portal and transforming
themselves into pterodactyls.

"This is not going to be easy," projected Blue.

"Yet, trees grow," projected Violet. I realized she meant that the
very difficult happens and even happens normally.

Our weary minds were still highly evolved and enormously capable. We
continued to analyze, consider and resolve at a speed comparable on
this world only to computers. We noted the locations of the
pterodactyls, their numbers in each location and, very importantly,
the place the other passage was located. This was by no means as
concealed as an old mine shaft. In the sky some ten metres above a
remote mountaintop in the Swiss Alps hung what appeared to be an
enormous spider web. It was the lines of such a web, which had
given the sky in the image of the Indian village its appearance of
being so unnaturally cracked.

Remarkably, the few huts and even the score of curious Swiss, who
stood watching from barely a kilometre away, were still completely
unharmed. The pterodactyls were simply using this as a transfer
point. From here they were teleporting themselves to all corners of
the globe.

Mentally, I saw airplanes falling from the sky and frantic
infantrymen sending bullets, shells and rockets from the ground at
the living aerial antagonists so effectively making short shrift of
Earth's most modern air forces. It was all in vain.

What had been the exception in the false images, now turned out to
be the rule. The ultrdimensional creatures with quite a competent
grasp of strategy, were engaged in a vicious strike at numerous
military bases all over the world. The action was quite intense and
it was not the pterodactyls, which seemed impervious to any
conventional Terran weapons, who were in serious straits. On all
inhabited continents of the globe, they were winning hands down.

Even as the complete planet wide picture of this action was still
being processed by our five minds, we teleported to the source of
the problem. I could read the astonishment on the part of the Swiss
villagers. It was almost more amazing to see humans appear in your
sky as it was to watch dragons flying out of mowhere into those same
skies.

We could all read the amusement and contempt on the part of the
dozen pterodactyls who swung out to intercept us.

"Here come the latecomers," one projected derisively.

"Here come the dawdlers," sneered another.

Yet, we sensed that behind those sneers lay a very healthy respect
for our magical capacity. They knew our history, certainly that part
of it concerned with keeping normal space free of their kind, at
least as well as we did. They knew that there had been other times
those such as themselves had striven to vanquish the Guardians of
Light and run rampant in our dimension. They knew that on each of
those occasions we wizards had driven them back to their own place.

We hurled this thought at them as the opening move in this colossal
struggle.

They cast it aside, as easily as a goalie stopping a long slow shot
with no one blocking his vision.

"This is an entirely different situation," projected one of them.
"You appear to be the same creatures as those who confronted us in
the distant past. Is not your power identical to theirs? Yet, we
have had a hundred thousand of our generations to evolve. Have we
not proved this evolved strength? Has not a single one of us all but
proved too much for three of you? Indeed, has not the least of us,
not even one of us, but an ally from your own dimension, succeeded
in killing one of you?"

Zandala was the greatest sorcerer of his age," began Orange.

I, however, finished the retort. "Are you saying that I am dead?"
I asked and threw all the scorn and contempt I could into that
question.

"Yes," sneered one, whom I took to be the leader of this squadron.
"And not only are you dead, but each of the four fools with you."
They all laughed at that joke, which was their affirmation that they
would utterly defeat us.

And then there were aerial acrobatics in the Swiss sky, though at
such a speed as to deny the villagers any enjoyment at their
proximity to what would have proved an amzing spectacle, could only
they detect motion so remarkably rapid.

The pterodactyls tried to treat us as if we were military aircraft.
This failed, for we were much faster that the fastest jets the skies
of Earth had ever seen. So, as they dove at us in formation, as they
strove to appear where they thought we might go, on the basis of
what they read of our intent in our minds, we eluded them. Often
this was with barely a microsecond to spare. Twice we succeeded in
tricking them to a spot in such a way that two of them collided with
each other. Even though this resulted in four of them being damaged
a bit, and not up to par for the rest of the confrontation, it still
left us with eight uninjured ones against the five of us.

"This can go on for ever," projected Yellow. "We are no closer to
closing that passage than when we arrived."

"They're not even bothering to throw any reinforcements against us,"
projected Orange. We could all perceive that even as our struggle
raged, pterodactyls continued to emerge from the passage. However,
instead of rushing over to take part in the battle against us, they
vanished from these skies to reappear over the various military
bases around the world, which were simultaneously under attack.

"Right," agreed the Wizard of Yellow, as he dodged, at computer
swift speed, a pincer move by three of the pterodactyls. "Let's
show them what we can do."

Then our five minds, shielded in their depths, deeper than the
pterodactyls could reach with their keenest offensively telepathy,
conceived a plan. We created a mental construct replicating the
matrix of the spell, by which we had closed the squirrel hole and
the passage in the old mine shaft. We also wove together again a
psychic image of the same kind of net, containing the same most
powerful magical formula as had almost trapped the first pterodactyl
to emerge here.

For half a second the gymnastics and maneuvers continued. Then Blue
sensing the thoughts in each of our minds, realizing all was ready,
gave the mental signal, "Now!"

On that signal, we teleported the actualizing image, the concrete
reality of the first of these spells. The net formed a wall between
us and the pterodactyls. We could feel them sneering at it, even as
the psychic equivalent of shivers ran up their spines. This was
anethema for them. They still didn't realize that we were up to more
than simply trying to hold them off, that we were doing more than
erecting a defensive barrier between them and us. Then, we activated
an aspect of the magical net which drove them back towards the
portal. Our five minds calculated the possible escape routes within
this dimension, ever shrinking in number as the distance from the
portal to them shrank. I could read their various thoughts
attempting to overcome the net.

"Let's alter the spacial co-ordinates of the terminal on this
planet," projected one of them. Then, I saw the image on another
mountain range in his mind. I could feel the appropriate energy
building within them to act on that decision. Yet, six microseconds
before the terminal would have been moved to the Urals, the second
half of our plan was enacted. Even as we had closed the squirrel
hole, exactly as we had blocked off the passage in the old mine
shaft, so, now appeared the psychic cap in this very spot, which had
been the Terran terminal of this interdimensional passage.

We could sense the astonishment of the pterodactyls. They were
amazed that they had not detected that thought within our minds.
They were quite surprised that we had the magical skill, not simply
to keep our design a secret from them, but to cause the material and
psychic elements of this barrier to their interdimensional portal to
appear at the precise spot it was required, despite their harrying
us and inspite of all their protective spells designed to keep their
gate open.

We sighed in relief. We had won the Battle of the Alps. Not only had
we chased a dozen of them back to their own dimension, but we had
closed another portal.

"We're not finished, not by a long shot," projected Blue.

"Right," projected Yellow, "There are still two hundred and sixty
eight of them here."

Even as he stated the exact number, we were mentally viewing the
various sites where each of them was located, and quickly trying to
come up with a plan to deal with them.

"I don't think we have the energy to open up a new gate for them and
then close it again," projected Violet. She was feeling regret that
this analysis of the problem was bringing us very close to a
decision that could involve a loss of life on the part of our
adversaries. We value life very highly, and had taken great pains up
to this point not to slay any of our foes, but merely to drive them
back to their own dimension.

"It's theoretically possible," projected Yellow, "to construct an
area of psychic containment and transfer them all there."

"For two hundred and sixty eight highly capable magic users?" asked
Orange.

"For how long?" queried Violet.

We were swiftly analyzing the liklihood that were we to teleport
them somewhere off this planet, outer space, the moon, the sun, or
somewhere else, they would be able to damage this space time
continuum.

"I guess the sun is a better bet," projected Orange, though he was
still analyzing this situation, as were the rest of us.

"I don't like it," projected Yellow. "There are too many variables
and unknowns."

"Not least of which," projected Blue, "is the nature of the place
they come from. If their fellows there are able to track them and
open a portal to them, then won't they simply be able to divert the
energy of the sun out of this dimension, leaving only a black hole
in its stead?"

It was a very disturbing thought, and since we could not be sure,
one of our best options seemed unusable.

"How about this planet's satellite?" projected Orange.

"The moon controls the tides," I projected with an image in my mind
of a coastal city being overwhelmed by a massive wave.

"The other planets?" Violet offered the next logical possibility.

No one could come up with any serious objection. The containment
spell which we envisaged had been designed to take advantage of a
planet's gravity. While the gas giants were huge, even while the
gravity to found on their surface exceeded that of Earth, still,
their frozen atmospheres, in a psychic sense allowed one to
associate levity and release from them.

There was some debate on this, as Orange felt that if even the air
on them was held in a frozen state, it was foolish to consider them
as magical symbols of escaping confinement. Nevertheless, following
a consideration that would have occupied several academic sessions,
though it took us a third of a second, the vote was four to one
against the gas giants.

"Mars is closest right now," I projected.

There was about a hundredth of a second of intense analysis. No
objections were raised. "Then we are agreed," declared Blue.

The instant she affirmed our conclusion, the area of confinement and
the binding spells to accompany it were readied. Our visualization
was greatly aided by the fact that at least some of them, including
the introductory one, had first appeared here in the form of black
flies. This enabled us to project the image of a huge strip of
adhesive fly paper to which we could bind them.

The instant we had this, we appeared over a French military base. We
paid no heed to the signs of utter devestation, to the wrecked
aircraft and tanks scattered about on the ground. We could feel the
astonished gaze of the surviving French soldiers when they noticed
us appear. This, too, we ignored.

What we did was thrust the full force of our will upon the
pterodactyls. They felt the intensity of this will, and were not
able immediately to resist their return to the size of black flies.
At once, we cast at them the large psychic strip of fly paper. Even
as they enraged began to struggle to break free of the spell which
had so greatly reduced their size, they discovered that they were
trapped in a far more serious and lasting sense than they had at
first imagined.

Ignoring the mental fury that seethed within that flypaper, which
now prevented them from hurling any spells and even any simple
telepathic comments towards us, we moved on to Egypt. Then we went
to Pakistan and continued around the globe until we had visited all
the threatened military installations where there were still present
pterodactyls and had collected all two hundred and sixty eight black
flies. I could feel our collective sigh as we perceived them all
firmly stuck to our magical flypaper.

"Now!" exclaimed Blue, as an image of an area on the surface of Mars
came into my mind and the minds of my fellow wizards. As instantly
as this was thought, we projected the flypaper with its clinging
black flies to that very spot. It was then warded with the strongest
spells we knew. It was possible that spot would prove impenetrable
as long as that planet existed.

We hovered there in the sky above an American military base and
could feel how much energy had been drained from us. Millions of
miles across space the pterodactyls were imprisoned, never, we
hoped, to be capable of threatening this planet and this dimension
again.  Perhaps, sometime soon after we were completely revivified
we could devote special attention to altering their alignment,
transforming them into more apt visitors to dimensions of order and
light.

"Ah," projected Yellow, "I'm looking forward to a good rest."

"We all are," projected Blue.

Even as we planned what was to come next, whether three of us, or
one would remain on this planet, and how intense a state of alert we
would maintain for how long a period of time, we five took a moment
to express our gratitude to the god of Gvihlih-hih, the one god of
the universe. He had brought our Council into existence, in the
incredibly ancient past. At that time, when the ruler of the other
dimension had stretched forth his hand to extinguish the Light on
Gviglih-hih, the great god of the forest had himself intervened and
chased the demons back to their own dimension. He had not done that
this time. However, we credited him with giving us the energy and
insight which resulted in our victory.

It was a strange position for me, who prior to becoming the Wizard
of Green had little to do with gods, save in gaming, but those were
just imaginary constructs. They didn't require any acceptance by
logic and faith.

It was agreed that the five of us sweep once more around the world,
ensuring that we had missed nothing, and that the planet was safe,
at least from all external threat. Then, one would remain,
continuing our observation here and our historical research on the
use of magic by Earthmen past and present. The other four would
return home, though for some time to come, we would be on maximum
alert.

"I guess it should be the Wizard of Green who remains," I projected,
though truthfully I was itching to check out my tower in the
southern mountains. I had all these fine memories preserved in the
ring. However, I had yet to step inside the walls of my own tower.

"Not at all," contradicted Orange. "Do you think I'm going to pass
up this opportunity to check into Hindu, Sufi, Aboriginal and
Tibetan magical chants? No, you go and get acquainted with the Tower
of Green and all the fascinating things to be learned in the south."
