FORTUNE-TELLERS AND PHILOSOPHERS, Richard J. Smith, Westview Press,
Boulder, San Francisco, Oxford, 1991.

This book is subtitled "Divination in Traditional Chinese Society", and
it is a fairly comprehensive and fascinating look at that topic, very much
worth the attention of anyone interested in the subject.

Following a preface (pages xi-xiii) in which the author introduces readers 
to a definition of divination, to its popularity even today, and to his own
interest in Ch'ing society, and an introduction (pp. 1-11) offering scenes
of present day divination, and thoughts on cultural unity and diversity,
comes a survey of divination prior to the Ch'ing Dynasty.

This historical survey, Chapter One, "Viewing the Flowers from Horseback"
(pp. 13-47), begins with the traditional view of Fu Hsi inventing the
trigrams and the development of the hexagrams. It mentions oracle bones in
pre-Shang times, the importance of Shang rulers communicating with
Shangdi, the first ancestor, shamans, dream interpretation and phrasing
questions as statements.

The change to the Chou Dynasty is seen as a movement to a more secular
time. However, there are concepts, such as the Mandate of Heaven,
correlative cosmology and five elements, as well as the continued use of
divination, including by milfoil, astrology, geomancy, physiognomy, etc. A
very significant contribution is the text of the I CHING. This has drawn
numerous commentaries (more than two hundred in a 1715 edition) and quite
varied understanding.

The Chou preserved the I CHING. The early Han scholar Tung Chung-shu (c.
179 -- c. 104 B.C.E.) underlined correlative cosmology, emphasized the
three relationships (emperor/subject, husband/wife, parent/child) and
focused on ethics. Great attention was paid to the I CHING, of which
alternate versions were available, as well as alternate systems inspired
by the I CHING. The most important of these was Yang Hsiung's (53 B.C.E. -
18 C.E.) T'AI HSUAN CHING (CLASSIC OF THE SUPREME MYSTERY). This had 81
tetragrams, instead of 64 hexagrams and a trinary (heaven, earth and man)
system, in place of the binary I CHING.

There is mention of the sense of rivalry that could exist between
Confucian scholar officials and the fangshi, but also of the admiration
such officials could have for such a specialist in divination as Sima
Jishu. 

The reader is reminded that while the fall of the Han Dynasty, as the fall
of Rome, resulted in division, in China this period of division was one of
intense intellectual and cultural stimulation. Buddhism and Taoism throve.
Wang Bi (226-249) wrote an impressive commentary on the I CHING. Despite
religious prohibitions, Buddhist and Taoist priests divined. During this
period geomancy became popular, though:

   The earliest book on grave location, entitled the Zangjing (Burial
   Classic), is generally ascribed to a Mr. Qingwu ("Green Raven") of the
   Qin-Han period, whose pseudonym became a common term for geomancy in
   late imperial times. p. 37

There is reference to diviners such as Guan Lu (210-256) and Xiao Ji (d.
610). And there's the reunification of China with the Sui and then the
T'ang Dynasties. There were similarities to the Qin and Han Dynasties:

   It is true that during both eras the reigning emperors continued to
   promote the ancestral cult and state religion, paid close attention to
   portents (with an eye toward using them to enhance their own power and
   legitimacy), and tried to maintain official orthodoxy, however defined. 
   They selected auspicious days on which to undertake important events,
   and employed both fangshi and regular officials to undertake
   astrological and calendrical calculations on behalf of the dynasty. 
   p. 39 

Different was Buddhism's influence and the extent of imperial concern to
control divination, without much success. The great diviner Li Xuzhong
(fl. c. 790-835) is mentioned and his still extent BOOK OF FATE. 

Next comes the Sung Dynasty with Neo-Confucianism and its attention to the
I CHING. There's mention of inventions such as the compass and printing,
and such developments as increased literacy and refining astrology by
inclusion of the hour of birth. There is also spirit writing which the
book claims originated in, "The Tang-Song period." (p. 44. The Mongols
were very interested in divination, drawing upon Arabic astronomy and
Tibetan divination. The Ming continued this cosmopolitan approach, adding
the Western astronomy of the Jesuits.

Chapter Two, "Orthodox Cosmology in the Qing" (pp. 49-91, begins with the
deliberate Manchu support for traditional Chinese culture, and the quite
complex Chinese cosmological system. The traditional Chinese approach to
harmonizing varying factors is noted.   

   As Paul Unschuld has observed in his study of Chinese medicine:
   "Somehow a way was always found in China to reconcile opposing views
   and to build bridges -- fragile as they may appear to the outside
   observer -- permitting thinkers and practitioners to employ liberally
   all the concepts available, as long as they were not regarded as
   destructive to society." p. 51

There is Zhu Xi's Supreme Ultimate generating yin and yang which develope
into greater yin and lesser yin, greater yang and lesser yang, then into
the eight trigrams and sixty-four hexagrams. There is spirit, fortunate
and baleful, growing and declining. There are the five agents and their
sequences. There are correspondences and numerology. There is the
complexity of astrology, including heavenly influences from spirits not
visibly manifest in the sky.

   The Xieji bianfang shu, following in the footsteps of the Xingli   
   kaoyan, provides an inventory of about 250 star-spirits -- the
   majority of which were negative -- together with background
   information on each, including the year, month, hour and position or
   direction in which they were presumed to be dominant. Among them, only
   the spirits associated with the sun, moon, five planets, asterisms of
   the twenty-eight lodges, and the Big Dipper (Northern Ladle, or Beidou) 
   seem to be linked to observable celestial bodies. pp. 63-65

There were celestial correspondences on earth. For example:  
 
   Accordingly, when Beijing was correlated with the Jupiter station Ximu, 
   its major asterisms appeared to be Wei and Ji; and because Ximu was
   also part of a group of seven asterisms called the Green Dragon
   (Qinglong, one of four such groupings for the twenty-eight lodges), the
   city became identified with yang, wood, the east and spring. But when
   Beijing was viewed in isolation from the system of stations, it fell
   under the primary influence of the asterism known as Tianshi yuan
   ("Heavenly Market Enclosure"). In these circumstances, the city's
   primary identification was with yin, water, the west, and fall. p. 67  

While some scholars might be critics of some aspects or systems, none
objected to the concept of correlative cosmology. While some scholars
criticized the misuse, especially fraudulant, of fortune-telling, none
objected to divination per se.

Then there is the state calendar, its importance, its annual ceremonial
presentation at dawn on the new moon of the first winter month (eleventh
month of the year), European domination of the Qing imperial Board of
Astronomy, various calendrical details, including spiritual influences,
lucky and unlucky days, methods of overcoming inauspicious influences, etc.

There follow the very popular almanacs, cheap, often with lucky red covers
and with much useful information.

   For example, some tongshu identified the daily location of "womb
   spirits" so that pregnant women and members of their households could 
   avoid miscarriages and birth defects by staying away from those parts
   of the house (front gate, pestle, mill, chicken coop, kitchen, stove,
   bed, storage area, toilet, etc.) where such spirits might be present at
   a certain time. p. 84

There was information on preparing for births, dream interpretation,
looking after growing children, and, of course, lucky and unlucky days,
even if some scholars might criticize day-selection, as evidenced by a
reference to the popular novel Hunglu meng (Red Chamber Dream).  

Chapter Three, "The Yijing in Qing Society" (pp. 93-129), begins with the
ubiquity of this primary Classic, the many commentaries on it, the
differing views on placing weight on its ethics or on its numerology or
divination, the efforts of Chu Hsi at reconciling both, the work's
absorbing complexity and cryptic nature, debate on the authenticity of
Neo-Confucian diagrams, with the whole issue of Han vs Sung scholarship,
Ch'ing textual analysis.

Then comes a description of the solid (yang) and broken (yin) lines, their
appropriate position (yang, odd, yin, even), the superior rank of higher
numbered lines, relationships of lines, dominating lines, trigram
configurations (lines 1,2,3 with 4,5,6 and lines 2,3,4 and 3,4,5), trigram
correspondences, and various factors in interpreting hexagrams.

Then comes the divination proper:

   The fundamental aim in divining with the Yi, as explained in the "Great 
   Commentary," was to understand the situation represented by a given
   hexagram, to identify the incipient moment (ji) of change within it,
   and to respond to the situation and its changing circumstances in an
   appropriate way. By internalizing the spiritual capacity of the milfoil 
   as well as the mind of the sage, a person could not only know the
   future (that is, the pattern or principle [li] of unfolding events,
   which was already present in incipient form), but also develop the
   capacity to adopt a sage-like response. p. 108 

There's the ritual ablution, entrance from the east, burning of incense,
invocation of the milfoil stalks, detailed process of drawing the
hexagram, though one could shorten this by tossing three copper coins,
once for each line. And, there's interpretation, as exemplified by the
letter Zeng Guofan received from his son, Yan Fu's divination journal and
accounts of the Kangxi emperor. This emperor devoted some considerable
study to and consideration of this topic.

At times, people were reluctant to give an unfavourable reading to a
ruler. The Kangxi emperor wanted the truth. However, when a diviner,
following the Boxer Rebellion, understood the reading as stating there
should not be a woman ruler, a high official conveyed a much more
favourable interpretation to the Empress Dowager, and to his surprise, the
diviner received a rich reward. There are a number of cases cited of
people consulting the I CHING, some at important points in their lives.
Thus, Lu Gong became Grand Secretary, and Le Zhixian a Taoist sage.

There are some observations from foreigners in China, perhaps the most
fascinating mentioning the detail that the three coppers are shaken inside
a tortoise-shell.

Then comes consideration of the I CHING's influence on Chinese cosmology,
numerological and metaphorical symbolism, art, poetry, popular literature
and science. The point is made that China's great minds contemporary with
Harvey, Galileo, Boyle and Newton were focusing their attention on ancient
words, rather than the modern scientific world.

Chapter Four, "The Ways of Wind and Water" (pp. 131-171), begins with the
definition of geomancy. "The Chinese art of selecting auspicious locations
for tombs, houses, and other structures." It mentions the modern term,
"fengshui (lit. 'wind and water')" and the more prevalent Ch'ing, "Kanyu
(lit. 'cover and support')" and specialists were often called, "fengshui
masters (fengshui xiansheng)" p. 131

The most significant objects requiring careful siting were tombs, because
appropriately located burial places not only respected ancestors, but also
empowered them in their aspiration to exercise beneficial influence on
their descendants. Most geomancers looked back to Guo Pu (4th C.C.E.). The
luopan (compass) was a significant tool.

   This device, which will be described in greater detail below, had a
   magnetized needle, the red tip of which pointed south, and a series of
   concentric rings or layers (ceng) that contained the major Chinese
   symbols used to deal with space, time and cosmic change: yin and yang, 
   the four seasons and cardinal directions, the five "agents," the eight
   trigrams, the nine moving "stars" (jiuxing; also designated
   "star-spirits"), various "palaces" (gong), the ten stems and twelve
   branches, the twenty-four directions, the twenty-eight lunar lodges,
   the sixty-four hexagrams, and so forth (see chapter 2). p. 135 

Usually made of lacquered wood, the luopan was used, sometimes along with
intuition and such factors as the shapes of land formations. There was the
significance of timing in considering the various factors whose
interrelationships were in constant flux. A good site would be cradled by
a hill, spared the north wind and enjoy moderate breezes and water flow.
Trees or groves could substitute for hills. Some basic caveats included
not building a house on a battlefield or opposite a prison gate.

   Few locations were ideal, but a truly bad site could usually be
   improved, either by the use of charms (see next section) or by physical 
   changes in the environment. One such modification might be to break off 
   the sharp point of a dangerous "fire" rock to transform it into the
   harmless form of "wood." Building an appropriately-scaled water tank or 
   redirecting a brook could achieve the same effect. "Geomantic pagodas"
   (fengshui ta), whether fashioned out of piled-up stones or built
   according to orthodox architectural principles, had the capacity to
   ward off evil influences if situated correctly. pp. 144-146 

There is discussion of factors benefiting cities, such as the two chains
of hills at Canton. Beijing was naturally protected by mountain ranges,
augmented by siting of gates, by artificial hills and streams, etc.

There is mention of the wide variety of backgrounds of those practising
geomancy, of the scholarly air of geomancers, of the rarity of female
geomancers, of geomancers encouraging offspring to enter the civil service
and the transmission of geomantic knowledge to be literary, rather than
within the family.

If family fortunes demonstrated that a tomb had ceased exerting beneficial
influence, geomancers could assist in selection of a site for reburial.
Filial piety inspired some people to study geomancy. Ethics was considered 
essential in the profession. Often instead of offering much money, clients
provided bounteous and respectful hospitality. Geomancers could also
provide negative advice, such as that given to the Empress Dowager, who
cut down a tree at a grave site in 1899 to lessen the ability of Prince
Chun to confer benefit on his predicted imperial grandson. It is
beneficial siting that draws recorded praise, and also both practical help
on waterworks and an aesthetic eye. 

While many people considered geomancy a kind of insurance, there was
awareness of unscrupulous practitioners and there were sceptics, whose
scepticism often fluctuated with their fortunes. Geomancers were
criticized for delaying burials.

   The Qing legal code, which devoted enormous attention to matters
   pertaining to proper burial, included specific provisions designed to 
   prevent "ignorant people, deluded by geomancy" (yumin huo yu fengshui) 
   from delaying interment, or disturbing the remains...But reports from
   cities such as Suzhou in Jiangsu, of thousands of coffins lining rivers 
   and covering fields, all awaiting a propitious time for burial, suggest
   that many people simply ignored the law. p. 162

Critics also mentioned the social unrest of competition, even by brothers,
for good fengshui. There are several pages devoted to disputes over
fengshui, including those caused by Western Churches, etc.

Chapter Five, "Reading Fate" (pp. 173-219), begins with the ubiquity of
belief in fate, and then examines astrology, physiognomy (head, hand,
including fingers and joints, and other parts of the body), and fathoming
written characters, noting that these were interrelated. He notes the
distinction between Chinese and Western astrology, with the Chinese less
connected to the visible heavens. He names some significant texts.

   The primary textual authority for fate extrapolation in Qing times was 
   the Sanming tonghui (Compendium of the Three Fates), commonly
   attributed to the Ming astrologer Wan Mingying. Reprinted in both the
   Siku quanshu and the Tushu jicheng, it remains to this day a standard
   work of fortune-tellers in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Like the Xieji
   bianfang shu and most geomantic handbooks as well, the Sanming tonghui
   begins with an explanation of general principles, laying out in detail 
   the cosmological variables pertinent to fate extrapolation: yin and
   yang the five "agents," stems and branches, solar periods, and the
   usual inventory of celestial influences, including palaces, stars and 
   star-spirits. p. 177   

One significant attribution is the determination of fate for the first
twenty years of one's life based on the year on one's birth, the next two
decades on the month of birth, the third score of years on the day, and
the fourth on the hour. Of course, Chinese clients of diviners included
many highly concerned with examination results. Another very important
application was the analysis of the horoscopes of prospective marriage
partners.

   After preliminary investigations by a matchmaker, the "eight
   characters" of a prospective bride were sent to the home of the
   prospective groom, where they would be placed in front of the ancestral 
   altar for three days. If no inauspicious omens appeared during this
   period, the girl's horoscope would then be sent to a professional
   diviner by the boy's parents. If this divination proved favorable, the
   go-between took the boy's horoscope to the girl's family, where it
   underwent similar scrutiny. p. 185

   The Shenxiang quanbian (Complete Guide to Spiritual Observation [and
   Analysis]) was to physiognomy what the Sanming tonghui was to fate
   extrapolation. Compiled in the Ming dynasty by Yuan Zhongshe, a
   practicing physiognomer, it was reprinted in the Tushu jicheng
   (although not the Siku quanshu) and it remains to this day the single 
   most important Chinese reference work for "body divination." p. 188

There are illustrations of faces and palms to augment the text. There are
references to other characteristics such as bumps on the back of the head,
complexion, neck, stomach, etc. Also, some physiognomers took into
account, not only the physical body, but also a client's "inner spirit." 
(p. 201)

Next comes reference to analysis of Chinese characters, and the kind of
word play possible by adding and deleting strokes, or reading words within
characters, etc. There is reference to the ancient and revered nature of
the written language by a society which called for ceremonial burning of
all written refuse.

Next comes a look at diviners mentioned in surviving records, with their
official and elite biases as to gender, class and education. And, there's
the public nature of divinations conducted at stalls in the street, in the
market, or at temples. And, of course, the diviners were adept at deducing
information from their clients' clothes, speech, etc., even where they did
not make use of informants to enhance their extraordinary air. Sometimes
they made errors, as when a scholar in mourning and hence not attired
normally was informed he would never pass the exams, already successfully
completed. There are references to diviners rendering services to the
authorities, civil and military. They helped locate lost objects,
including escaped prisoners, provided weather forecasts, helped in the
selection of subordinates, and, sometimes, having studied military
manuals, could offer useful advice to generals. 

There are stories about diviners' foreknowledge, for example, Li Taichu
who kept his family home one day, and, thus, they escaped suspicion for a
crime commited then. There is reference to political predictions,
sometimes extracted from such initially unsuspected sources as the poetry
of previous dynasties.

Chapter Six, "Spirit Mediums and Spirit Messages" (pp. 221-257), begins by
mentioning the opposition of the elite to the lower classes consulting
shamans, even though it was considered fine, even necessary, for such
contact with spirits to happen in higher and in official circumstances.
Shamans were especially popular in the South and among Manchus and other
minorities. Despite official opposition they were popular, even in urban
areas. Descriptions of shamanic performances and spirit-writing are
provided. There is reference to the varying literacy of shamans and the
ability of some spirits to communicate in elevated language, even
exchanging matching couplets with scholars. Sometimes major deities
spirit-wrote. Sometimes unfavourable spirits came. Good spirits would
include ethical advice.

   One did not, of course, require shamans to receive spiritually-inspired 
   messages. Signs portending the future were visible everywhere. All
   sectors of Qing society had an acute awareness of the importance of
   omens, from the Son of Heaven to the lowliest peasant. p. 233

Many things could serve as omens, and depending on what time the thing
happened, could presage a variety of cominf fates. Divining blocks were
used for yes and no answers, and for more complex readings. Bamboo
spiritual sticks were very popular. The manner of their use and a reading
from the most popular kind of manual (associated with the War God, Guandi) 
is provided in some detail.

The fortunes provided were weighted in the favourable direction. Clients
were also urged to focus on ethical behaviour. Other methods of divination
included letting a bird select from slips of paper, or cards, with
fortunes written on them. Turtles and snakes were also used to indicate
such fortune cards. And, there was dream interpretation. People would pray
for dreams, spend the night at temples, draw on the rich supply of dream
references in classical literature and history, consult dream books,
accept dream messages from ancestral and other spirits, realize the
intricacies of symbolic interpretations, sometimes connected with the
nature of the written language.

   Some of the dream interpretations offered in the Zhougong jiemeng would 
   seem to be at least plausible in almost any culture. One might assume,
   for example, that the positive imagery of a rising sun or new
   vegetation, like the negative connotations of storms and damaged
   property, would resonate in most societies, past and present...But the
   vast majority of images and interpretations contained in the Zhougong
   jieming are quite specific to Chinese tradition. Without knowing about
   the sage emperor Shun's dream life, who could guess that long eyebrows
   would have a decidedly positive oneirocritical connotation? The image
   of a flying swallow entering a person's breast might well not conjure
   up the idea of a noble birth in the absence of information about the
   jade bird dream of Zhang Yue's mother in the Tang dynasty. And without 
   appreciating the pervasive Chinese principle of paradoxical
   interpretation, one could hardly imagine that good fortune could arise
   from a dream about being covered with urine and feces, or that a dream
   of a man and a wife beating each other would indicate marital harmony. 
   p. 254

Chapter Seven (pp. 254-287) is the conclusion, repeating and summing up
points made earlier. I would sum up the book by saying it has much
fascinating detail, including names and references to many diviners, about
a variety of quite interesting systems and their influences on the wider
society. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the
topic.<p>
