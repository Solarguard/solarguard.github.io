<h2>A Dream of Red Mansions (Hung Lou Meng)</h2>

Tsao Hsueh-chin and Kao Ngo, transl. Yang Hsien-yi and Gladys Yang, Foreign 
Languages Press, Peking, 1978.<p> 

<p>Some consider this the best Chinese novel. It was written about 250
years ago and thus may be seen as a culmination of novels from the Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644). Since the reading and writing of novels was not
considered proper in imperial China, the authorship of this one has been
attributed, according to Twentieth Century scholarship, to Ts'ao
Hsueh-Ch'in and Kao Ou.

<p>This is a long (close to 1,900 pages) family story. Even if the authors
of novels in imperial China withheld their names from such frivolous
work, this reader was quite impressed by the highly polished quality of
the account of the Chia family. Largely, what we see is the young
aristocrat Pao-yu and his relatives and maids who through much of the
story are living in the mansion's exquisite garden.

<p>Pao-yu is supposed to be preparing himself for the state exam by which
one entered the civil service. At one point his father tells him to
present himself the next morning with the work he has been doing for the
past three years. That night, Pao-yu's maids stay up writing out
calligraphy assignments in Pao-yu's handwriting. Pao-yu is able to
impress his father, however, even before being called on to produce such
proof of his ongoing studies. He does this by composing a poem.

<p>Poetry is very evident in this work. The characters, at least Pao-yu and
other dwellers of the Garden, often compose poems. They even form a
poetry club, and, I believe, it is at the first meeting that they
compose poems on the theme of chrysanthemums. This is described fully
and a dozen poems occur at this point of the text. There is rich
allusion to China's history and culture. For example, at one point a
character writes a poem which includes the phrase, "Tapping at the
door." There is a note here by the translators that a famous T'ang poet
(hence about a thousand years before this novel was written) had
deliberated on the use of, "Tapping," or, "Pushing," here, and this came
to be used to indicate careful composition. 

<p>The characters are well drawn (I especially like the Old Lady), the
window provided by the book on many aspects of imperial China
fascinating, and the way the plot proceeds does not appeal to me. It is
still a great piece of literature and I read to the end.
