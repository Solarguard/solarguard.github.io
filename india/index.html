<p>The Subcontinent of India is a vast and diverse area long inhabited by humans. It is of enormous interest for its many accomplishments across the spectrum of human endeavour. This includes an especial harvest of humane and peaceful philosophical and theological expression.<p>

Created on September 8, 2008 C.E., Solarguard India now offers a brief summary of the Bhagavad Gita and one of the first two chapters of Romila Thapar's A History of India v. 1, as well introductory comments on Stuart Piggott's Prehistoric India and on the Penguin Hindu Myths translated by Wendy O'Flaherty. It is hoped all four will be fully available by the New Year and that these will inspire even further enhancement of this very significant subsection.<p>
