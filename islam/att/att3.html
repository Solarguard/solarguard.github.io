This third portion of the Solarguard precis of at Tabari is gratefully
completed this July 17, 2006 C.E. This file now contains a brief
summary of books eleven to fourteen of the English translation. It is 
hoped more of this key primary text will be available soon in fourth
and further files here.

As stated at the beginning of the first file, this summary fails to
convey the vast scope of the scholarship of the original with its so
very impressive listing of the chain of transmission of accounts and
presentation of differing accounts. The simplicity of this precis can
be very misleading. 

vol. 11, "The Challenge to the Empires," transl and annotated by Khalid
Yahya Blankinship, SUNY, Albany, 1985

The translator's forward (pp. xiii-xxx) notes this volume covers A.H. 12
to 13 and is largely a detailed account of the Arab campaigns in Persian
Iraq and Roman Syria. It mentions the place of Sayf as source and Sayf's
inclusion of fantastic material, oral narrative, a preference for Iraq,
in particular Kufa, an effort to describe the harmony of the early
Muslims and his preponderance of unknown sources -- reasons Medieval
Muslim scholars rejected Sayf's authority, although his strong Sunni
bias would have been expedient for them.

The text describes Khalid's advance into Iraq. He wrote a letter (p. 3
to 4) acknowledging receipt of tax from some towns and promising them
safety. Hirah agreed to pay tax. He wrote a letter calling the Persians
to submit. He met the commander Hormuz is single combat and killed him.
Khalid won victories at Madhar, Walajah, Ullays and Amghishiya.

Khalid defeated Persians damming the Euphrates, pushed and took Hira.
Peace was made with those who wished peace and paid the tax. Persia was
divided, failing to agree on who should be king. Khalid advanced further
into Mesopotamia taking Anbar, Ayn at Tamr and Dumat al Jamdal. Victory
was won at Husayd. Many fled Khanafis and Khalid seized Musayyakh.

At al-Firad, Persians and Romans sought to help each other. Khalid
decisively defeated them. Abu Bakr sent a letter commanding Khalid to
reinforce the Muslim armies in Syria. Khalid attacked a Roman force.
Bahan's forces defeated Khalid's and Khalid's son was killed. Heraklios
sent a large army to oppose the Muslim advance into Syria. Abu Bakr
ordered the Muslims there to combine their forces. He fell ill and
passed away ten days before the great victory at Yarmuk.

News of the Caliph's death was kept secret until after the battle. A
Roman commander named George converted and rode towards Khalid's tent.
His soldiers charged. The Muslims threw back the charge and slammed into
the Roman infantry. Emperor Heraklios was at Jerusalem urging restraint,
but he was not heeded. Battle took place and the great Roman army was
vanquished.

Abu Bakr named Umar to succeed him. Abu Bakr had lived in the manner of
the Prophet and died in his sixty third year, as had Muhammad. The first
Caliph had been a simple, honest merchant who continued his ordinary
hard work even after he was Commander of the faithful.

Umar presided at the funeral and appointed Abu Ubaydah to succeed Khalid
in Syria. Damascus submitted in the late summer of 635. Tiberias also
made peace, agreeing to pay the tax. In Arabia, Umar sent Yala ibn
Umayah to arrange the move of the non Muslims from Najran in Yemen. He
commanded that there be no temptation for them to convert and that they
be provided land equivalent to that they left.

Persia was beset by internal disharmony. Abu Ubayd won battles at an
Namariq, as Saqatiyyah, but when an elephant felled him at Marwahah, a
third victory was transformed into a defeat. Persian disharmony
prevailed and the Muslims steadied themselves. Al Muthanna, a just
commander, won a great victory at Buwayb. He led his troops in further
successful actions.

The Persians chose Yazdigird as king; Umar mobilized more troops.

vol. 12, "The Battle of al Qadisiyyih and the Conquest of Syria and
Palestine, transl. Yohanan Friedmann, SUNY, Albany, 1992.

The translators introduction (pp. xiii-xxii) notes the predominant role
in this volume of the significant Battle of Qadisiyyah and the
unresolved historical questions concerning it. It mentions the many
facets of the volume reminiscent of the professional story teller,
including the dramatic contrast between simple, upright Muslim envoys
and opulant, arrogant Persians. Included in this volume are the
Byzantine losses of Palestine and Syria.

The text describes Umar's dispatch of an army under Sa'd ibn Waqqas
against the Persians. Al-Muthanna succumbed to injuries; Bashir ibn al
Khasasiyyah succeeded. Umar urged Sa'd and those with him to be honest,
reliant on God and courageous. Sa'd ambushed a Persian bridal party,
capturing her and much booty. He distributed even his share of the
booty.

Sa'd camped at Qadisiyyih. The Persians requested an envoy. Al Mughirah
went. He explained that either the Muslims would die and enter paradise
or triumph or collect the tax. The Persians fought and lost. King
Yazdigird met Arab envoys who invited him to embrace Islam, pay tax or
fight. Yazdagird gave them dirt; they took that as a good omen. Arab 
scavenging caused Yazdagird to order general Rustam to cease his patient
policy and engage the enemy. Rustam's troops mistreated the local
population; Rustam beheaded some of his misbehaving soldiers.  

Tulayhah raided the Persian camp, taking a fine horse, killing two
pursuers and capturing a third. Rustam conversed with Zuhrah who assured
him that if the Persians accepted Islam, recognized the brotherhood of
humanity and ceased being masters of other people, the Arabs would only
arrive for peaceful trade, etc. Rustam was convinced, but others did not
accept.

Another account has an Arab envoy riding a horse and sticking his spear
into carpets and cushions. He issued the three choices of conversion,
tax or battle and would accept only a three day delay for Rustam to 
consult Persia's leaders about these choices. Rustam told Arab envoys
some parables, encouraging them to leave in peace. They persisted in
their three options. 

The Persians advanced; Sa'd ordered Koranic text on sacred struggle to
be read to the troops. After initial exchanges, Persian elephants
panicked Arab cavalry. A fierce Arab attack turned the elephants. 
Fighting continued until after sunset. The second day went badly for 
the Persians and fighting went on until midnight. A third long day of
intense fighting followed. Elephants again caused damage to the Arabs.
Again heroic action brought them down. Fighting persisted all through
the night. Next day Arab endurance told. Rustam fell, his forces
defeated.

Umar, informed of the victory, ordered the Muslims to stop and
consolidate their holdings. They had difficulty locating a healthy
base. The inhabitants of the conquered land now paid tax to Arabs.
The Persian royal estates were kept intact by the victors. Basrah was
founded. Some say Sa'd founded Kufah in A.H. 15.

The Byzantines were badly defeated at Marj ar Rum. Muslims beseiging 
Hims endured the cold; shouting "God is Most Great!" they shattered
the walls and forced submission of the city. Qinnasrin also fell.
Heraklios returned to Constantinople.

Caesarea was taken. Umar left Arabia and arranged peace with
Jerusalem. He entered the city, prayed and cared for the people. He
established the funding system for Muslims.

vol. 13, "The Conquest of Iraq, Southwestern Persia, and Egypt,"
translated and annotated by Gautier H.A. Juynboll, SUNY, Albany,
1989.

The foreward (pp. xiii-xviii) notes the heavy reliance of this
volume on the highly questionable Sayf, the presence of inflated
numbers, the conciseness in places of the Arabic original and other
challenges for the translator.

Zuhrah routed Persians at Burs. Sa'd shattered Persian troops at
Babil. Further victories followed. Abu Nubatah Na'il ibn Ju'shum at
Araji defeated a Persian noble and wore his armlets, the first
Muslim to wear such. In 16 A.H. Muslims took Bahurasir. Zuhrah was
felled by an arrow. Inspired by a dream, Sa'd ordered his cavalry to
cross deep water. Salman is said to have secured agreement of those
remaining in the White Palace to pay the tax. He with Sa'd led the
Muslims across the water. 

Muslims took Mada'in and used the great hall for prayers without
disturbing the statues there. Among the booty seized were royal
crowns, swords, armour, etc. Pursued from Mada'in the Persians made
a stand at Jalula. Muslims prevailed. Informed of further victories,
Umar urged a halt, saying he preferred peace to plunder. Yazdajird
fled towards Rayy. 

In May/June 637 (16 A.H.), Takrit fell. Masabadhan and Qarqisiyya
followed. Umar, in consultation with Ali, began the Islamic calendar.
In 17 A.H. Kufah was founded as a more salubrious abode for Arabs.
Some fifteen pages (61-75) describe its building, etc. Byzantines 
advanced towards Hims, but were repulsed. In 17 A.H. other Syrian 
cities and al Jazirah submitted. Accepted were conditions babies
not be baptized and conversion to Islam unhindered.

Plague broke out. Abu Ubaydah, Arab commander in Syria, died of it,
as did his successor, Mu'adh ibn Jabal. In 17 A.H. Umar built the
sacred mosque at Mecca. Al-Hurmuzan, a leading Persian noble, made
peace with advancing Arabs. He broke his word, was defeathed and
withdrew, his region falling to conquering Muslims. An unauthorized
attack was made by ship against Istakhr (Persepolis). There was 
tough fighting, but the Arabs were rescued and reached safety.
Yazdajird stirred up further conflict leading to further Persian 
losses. 

Al Hurmuzan, brought before Umar, converted to Islam and received a
stipend. The Persian fortress of Sus fell. Jundaysabur was taken.
In 18 A.H. there was severe drought and famine. Umar finally called
for help and the garrison cities promptly responded.

Events of 19 A.H. (pp. 160-161) include some already described in
varying reports. There are differing views as to when Egypt fell.
Some say 20 A.H. The leader in Alexandria accepted peace; some there
converted, some paid tax. There was fighting at Ayn Shams. Amr
forced its wall and it surrendered. The peace treaty (pp. 170-172)
granted immunity to Egypt's religion, land, possessions, etc.; the
tax was to be paid in three installments; those wishing to move out
of Muslim jurisdiction could safely do so. Fustat was founded.

Advances occurred to the west. Nubia repulsed a southern thrust. 
Umar drove Jews out of Arabia. 

vol. 14, "The Conquest of Iran," translated and annotated by G. Rex
Smith, SUNY, Albany, 1994.

The Foreward notes this volume covers the years 21-23, the expansion
eastward and the assassination and character of Caliph Umar. It notes
continued heavy reliance on the dubious Sayf for material. There's a 
brief bacground of conquests related in previous volumes, reference
to lack of clear military description in battle accounts, dating
discrepencies and improbability of Umar's close control of distant
events as asserted in the text.

After Nihawand, Arab armies thrust deeper into the Sassanid realm. 
There was fighting near Isfahan. After single combat between Abdallah
ibn Warqa and Fadhusafan, the Isfahan leader recognized the worth of
his adversary and made peace. The treaty obliged payment of tax and 
assistance to visiting Muslims in exchange for protection. Hamadan
submitted. There was a great battle at Waj ar Rudh. Fierce fighting
at Rayy delivered the town. A standard Muslim treaty was signed. The
towns or forts of Dunbawand, Qumis, Jurjan, Tabaristan, Azerbayjan,
the Armenians in al Bab (military service could be in lieu of tax),
Muqan in the Caucasus, Tiflis followed.

Umar dismissed Ammar from Kufan command. Yazdajird came to Marw ar
Rudh. He appealed to the Chinese (who advised peace), Soghdians and
Turkish rulers for troops. He was defeated at Balk. Turks arrived,
then withdrew. Persians seized Yazdajird's treasures, killed him and
made peace with Muslims.

In 23 A.H. Tawwa, Istakhr, Kirman, Sijistan and Makran were taken.
Persians and Kurds united at Bayrudh, but were defeated. A special
personal offering of booty to Umar was angrily rejected.

Umar was assassinated by a slave. Dying he appointed a committee to
name his successor. He died on November 5, 644 C.E. He was buried 
next day, joining the Prophet and Abu Bakr.

There follow (pp. 95-143) remarks and reports on: Umar's genealogy,
age, wives and children, memorable deeds, being first called the
Commander of the faithful, his instituting the calendar and state
registers, some quotes from his addresses and eulogies of him and
further meritorious deeds.

The five named to appoint the successor disturbed the dying Umar by
the loudness of their deliberations. He added a sixth. Ali and
Uthman were the two keenest contenders, Uthman the more popular. He
was chosen. There was great effort to restore and retain the unity
of the community.
