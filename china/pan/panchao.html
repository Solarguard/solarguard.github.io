PAN CHAO: FOREMOST WOMAN SCHOLAR OF CHINA, Nancy Lee Swann,
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 2001 (1932)

This fascinating and richly annotated work begins with a preface
(pp. ix-xv) by Susan Mann outlining the fluctuating awareness of
this significant and influential Han scholar and a brief look at her
American biographer and translator (1881-1966) who resided in
Montreal for the half decade or so prior to the 1934 move of the
Gest Chinese Research Library from McGill.

The Introduction (pp. xvii-xxi) mentions the eminence of imperial
historial Pan Chao (Ts'ao Ta-ku), her literary work and surviving
sources. Nancy Lee Swann makes the obligatory acknowledgements.

Chapter One, "The Age in Which She Lived" (pp. 3-11), outlines the
flow of Chinese history down to Pan Chao's times, noting the
replacement of feudal families with imperially appointed officials,
theoretical concepts of Classical thinkers underlining the
significance of Heaven's approval of virtue in a legitimate ruler
and the harmonious and civilized nature of the early ancestral model
of the Chinese state.

Chapter Two, "The Literature of the Age in Which Pan Chao Lived"
(pp. 12-21) considers the adoption and editing of the Confucian
classics, Han promotion of literature and scholarship: some of the
prominent figures in Former Han and Latter Han times, including:
Tung Chung-shu, Ssu-ma Ch'ien, Liu Hsiang, Liu Hsin, Yang Hsiung
(criticized for his enforced support of Wang Mang), Wang Ch'ung,
Tsui Yuan, Ma Rung and Ma Hsu, as well as the impressive high
imperial service of several generations of the Pan family.

Chapter Three, "Her Ancestry, Her Father, and Her Two Elder
Brothers" (pp. 25-39) notes the origin of the family from an
illegitimate son of the Ch'u royal Mi family. Ku-wu-t'u, born 604
B.C.E., allegedly was nourished by a tiger (pan). Swann sketches the
family's move north c. 223 B.C.E., Pan I's move further north in 210
B.C.E., the prosperity and scholarly attainments of his descendants,
the outstanding personality and literary ability of imperial
concubine Pan Chieh-yu. Her three brothers, Po, Yu and Chih, were
renouned. Yu read to the emperor and received copies of rare books.
Pan Chih avoided high service under Wang Mang.

Chih's son, Pan Piao, Pan Chao's father, strongly supported the Han
restorer Kuang-wu, was known for his amiable nature, omnivorous
reading and nine volumes of literary work.

Pan Ku and Pan Ch'ao (Pan Chao's brothers) were twins. Ku was the
literary figure who continued his father's historical work. Ch'ao
was the great military figure who extended Han authority far to the
west.

Chapter Four, "The Life of Pan Chao" (pp. 40-58), quotes the nine
paragraphs of Fan Yeh's early Fifth Century C.E. biography which
includes such information as Empress Teng as regent consulting Pan
Chao, Ma Rung's studying under Pan Chao and a listing of the dozen
genres Pan Chao's sixteen volumes of writings included. Quoted also
is the 1778 French translation in five paragraphs of an epitaph of
Pan Chao attributed to her daughter-in-law. This includes reference
to subjects Pan Chao taught the empress and palace ladies (poetry,
eloquence and history) and her work in the library.

The library work allows Nancy Lee Swann to comment on the 105 C.E.
notice concerning the invention of paper and to speculate concerning
the early use of this material for works being transcribed under Pan
Chao's direction, works which could include her own.

Next is mentioned and discounted the longer biographical sketch
published along with the epitaph in French in 1778. Nancy Lee Swann
briefly outlines references to Pan Chao, generally reiterations of
Fan Yeh, throughout succeeding dynasties and into Republican times.
Much of her literary work was lost and her influence endured largely
from her "Lessons For Women" and from historical recording of her
exemplary conduct.

Chapter Five, "Her Share in the Han Shu" (pp. 61-73), quotes three
paragraphs of Pan Piao's remarks on previous histories. It considers
the Han Shu as a worthy continuation of the Shih Chi, as the first
truly dynastic history, as being finally completed by Ma Rung (whose
method of smaller interlinear commentary enabled a distinction of
text from commentary), as receiving the attention of seventy-three
or seventy-five commentators, as being composed of one hundred
chapters with analysis of topics and the authorship of which topics
by which members of the Pan family. There is no unanimity on the
exact extent of Pan Chao's contribution and it is suggested that she
wrote nine chapters consisting of about a quarter of the complete
text.

Chapter Six, "Two Memorials" (pp. 74-81) contains Pan Chao's
petition for the retirement of aged Pan Ch'ao and Pan Chao's support
for the Empress Teng's brother to observe the traditional mourning
period.

Chapter Seven, "Lessons For Women" (pp. 82-99) begins with Pan
Chao's self-deprecatory remarks, references to her marriage at the
age of fourteen and admonitions her lessons be practised. She urges
women be: humble, industrious, sober, reverent, learned, generous,
respectful, modest, cleanly, obedient and a facilitator of harmony
with in-laws.

Chapter Eight, "Three Short Poems" (pp. 100-112), provides text,
translation and notes of the poems on the unusual bird sent to the
emperor by Pan Ch'ao, on the cicada and on needle and thread.

Chapter Nine, "Travelling Eastward" (pp. 113-130), describes Pan
Chao's journey with her son. Here, too, is text, translation and
annotation. The notes include reference to Yuan Yuan's (1764-1849)
calculation that the journey took place in 95 C.E.

Chapter Ten, "The Moralist" (pp. 133-139), notes Pan Chao's value in
enunciating feminine ethics, examines her advice, highlights the
significance of so early and emphatic a recommendation for the
education of girls, notes the accent on humble acquiescence and
harmonious relations with husband, parents-in-law and their children
and mentions some more recent advocates of women's education, such
as Lan Lou-chou in 1738 and Li Ju-chen in 1825.

Chapter Eleven, "Her Philosophy of Life" (pp. 140-144), draws from
her writings a glimpse of a likeable person, bracing herself for
that eastern journey, perhaps an animist, though one aware of the
influence of Heaven, one embued with the Classical spirit and
accepting of prevalent inequalities of class, sex and age.

Chapter Twelve, "The Woman of Letters" (pp. 145-155), traces the
presence of Pan Chao down the centuries in Chinese literature from
the compilation of her collected works by her daughter-in-law to
quotations from this in the c. 530 C.E. General Collection Wen Hsuan
to T'ang and Sung Dynasty cyclopedias to Yen K'o-chun's Nineteenth
Century careful gathering of three segments of the fragmented poem
"The Cicada." It considers her poetry as generally meeting the
description of fu and assesses Pan Chao in terms of current (1932)
Western poetic taste.

There is a bibliographical note (pp. 156-163) on sources and an
index (pp. 165-179)

This is an absorbing little book, an intersting presentation,
worthily annotated, of an eminent literary figure, illumining an
outstanding Han family.
