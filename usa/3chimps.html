The Third Chimpanzee, Jared Diamond, Harper, New York, 2006 (1992)

1. "A Tale of Three Chimps" (15-31): Defining a one percent species DNA
difference as a difference of one degree Celsius in the melting points
of the combined DNA and single species DNA, the author states humans
and chimpanzees have a 1.6 percent DNA difference. Junk DNA is
mentioned and some human/chimpanzee difference held to be said "junk".
Use of chimpanzees for medical experimentation is questioned.

2. "The Great Leap Forward" (32-57): Significant early evolutionary
changes included ability to walk upright (c. four million years ago)
and make stone tools. Neanderthals, physically distinct (including ten
percent larger brains and larger birth canal permitting hypothesis of
twelve month pregnancy) from modern humans, lacked regionally and
chronologically varied artifacts. They used fire, cared for the infirm
and buried the dead. Cro Magnons, similar to modern humans physically
and in varied and effective tool use, replaced Neanderthals in Europe
some forty thousand years ago, foreshadowing more recent enormous
impacts of contacts between higher and lower technologically advanced
societies. The Great Leap some fifty thousand years ago possibly
resulted from genetic modification permitting complex speech.

3. "The Evolution of Human Sexuality" (67-84): As human infants take an
unusually long time to train so they'll survive on their own, humans
normally mate and raise children long term. Human females do not
outwardly display fertility at the time of ovulation.

4. "The Science of Adultery" (85-98): Scientific analysis has
demonstrated extramarital sex is not uncommon. Asymetrical stringent
measures to ensure female fidelity are uniquely human, as is human
ethical focus at variance with simple evolutionary inclinations to
provide as many descendants as possible.

5. "How We Pick Our Mates and Sex Partners" (99-109): One seems most
sexually attracted to people most resembling those of the opposite sex
one saw most as a child (e.g. parent, sibling, though an incest taboo
applies to them specifically).

6. "Sexual Selection and the Origin of Human Races" (110-121): Natural
selection and sexual selection may both have contributed to human
species variations. Some, including colour of hair and eyes, may be
due to sexual selection.

7. "Why Do We Grow Old and Die" (122-136): Natural selection optimizes,
propelling forward entire individuals with enhanced traits. Rapid
reproduction and less biological repair could be expected for species
more liable to be eaten than winged avians and shell protected turtles.
Human children requiring lengthy rearing benefit from mothers avoiding
the risk of pregnancy and childbirth in old age.

8. "Bridges to Human Language" (141-167): Vervet monkeys have at least
ten "words." Scientists taught some gorillas and chimpanzees "the
meanings of up to several hundred symbols" and a chimpanzee understood
but didn't speak "a good deal of spoken English" (p. 151). Human
languages have complex grammar and have had such since recorded history
five thousand years ago. A study of similarities of creoles suggests
possible possession of a human genetic language blueprint.

9. "Animal Origins of Art" (168-179): Art experts have praised elephant
drawings and ape paintings unaware they weren't produced by humans.
Bowerbirds construct impressive mate attracting structures; unlike
songbirds whose utterances are innate, they learn to build them. Art
can arise from leisure time.

10. Agriculture's Mixed Blessings" (180-191): "With agriculture came
not only greatly increased food production and food storage, but also
the gross social and sexual inequality, the disease and despotism, that
curse modern human existence." (p. 160)

11. "Why Do we Smoke, drink, and Use Dangerous Drugs" (192-204):
Continuing to take addictive drugs is not surprising, commencing is.
Superiority assertion through handicap display is an effective
evolutionary characteristic maladapted by humans becoming harmfully
addicted.

12. "Alone in a Crowded Universe" (205-215): There unsurprisingly have
been no indications of aliens in the vast universe. That's just as well
as any such existing could treat humans as humans have treated each
other.

13. "The Last First Contacts" (223-234); Only in the last few thousand
years have humans routinely travelled afar. New Guinea's geography and
sparse food preserved isolated societies into the Twentieth Century.
Very localized languages, diseases and genetic abnormalities
flourished. First contact was intense, reducing human cultural
diversity. Present dominant American society has very negative
features, including "our treatment of old people, adolescent turmoil,
abuse of psychotropic chemicals, and gross inequality." (p.233)

14. "Accidental Conquerors" (235-248): The prevalence of Old World
domesticable animals strenthened those thrusting into places lacking
them. Cereal crops also favoured the Old World, as did its east-west
axis.

15. "Horses, Hittites and History" (249-275): Indo-European languages
spread throughout Europe, whence they were carried after 1492 around
the world. Examination of these languages permits postulation of the
parent language's vocabulary, date and possible location in southern
Russia. Hittite and Tokharian writings have been found in areas no
longer inhabited by Indo-European language speakers. The domesticated
horse appears to have facilitated Proto Indo-European expansion.

16. "In Black and White" (276-309): English colonists exterminated the
Tasmanians and greatly reduced the population of Aborigines on the
Australian mainland. Land lust was a major cause of genocide here as
elsewhere. Throughout history, this along with religious and political
differences, seeking scapegoats, etc. have produced massacres. Other
animals, including chimps, murder other bands of their species. Humans
have long treated fellow group members ('us") differently than "them,"
feeling murder acceptable in dealing with "them." Modern communications
and travel is blurring such distinctions.

17. "The Golden Age That Never Was" (317-338): Across the world,
premodern humans caused numerous species extinctions and destroyed
natural habitats. "While courses in the history of civilization often
dwell on kings and barbarian invasions, deforestration and erosion may
in the long run have been more important shapers of human history." (p.
335) Modern people have the advantage of scientific awareness of the
consequences of continuing unsustainable environmental behaviour.

18. "Blitzkrieg and Thanksgiving in the New World" (339-348): The first
humans arriving in the Americas may have begun a rapid extermination of
the continents' mammoths, etc.

19. "The Second Clous" (349-362): Humans now face two threats to
continued existence, nuclear and environmental holocaust. the latter
(notably species extinctions) is currently underway.

"Epilogue: Nothing Learned, and Everything Forgotten?" (363-368): The
Great Leap Forward some fifty thousand years ago involved a small
portion of genes, very likely enabling language. Murder and
environmental devastation are two very negative traits. From ignorance
and selfish greed some persist in such self-destructive activity.
Humans, nevertheless, can learn from past mistakes. Some effort, even
government attention, is being focused on preventing these holocausts.

Comment: The wide ranging considerations of this book stimulate thought
on issues crucial to the future of humanity. The author's unawareness
of present thought on functioning introns ("junk" DNA) can be explained
by the date of publication. His equal void when it comes to sightings
of UFOs and global warming is more interesting. In my opinion, this
work encourages thoughtful readers concerned with humanity's prospects
to seek further and try to learn specifically how to overcome self
destructive behaviour. MM
