The Science of Science, ed. Maurice Goldsmith and Alan Mackay, Penguin,
Harmondsworth, 1966 (1964)

This fascinating anthology is introduced by the editors (pp. 7-12):
Bernal's 1939 "The Social Function of Science" was much opposed. Now
there's rapidly increasing heavy investment in science, national
science policies, quantatative analysis embracing more fields. Science
permits human problem solving, impediments are largely psychological.

1. C.P. Snow's "J.D. Bernal, A Personal Portrait" (pp. 19-31): He was
studious, imaginative and energatic. He researched crystallography. He
birthed numerous ideas, encouraging others to write the papers. He
devoted much effort outside science.

2. E.H.S. Burhop's "Scientists and Public Affairs" (pp. 32-46): In the
1930s scientists felt clallenged to address public need for peace and
economic well-being. With the atomic bomb, scientists faced the reality
of potential human extinction. They became more politicized, organized
nationally and in 1946 founded the World Federation of Scientific
Workers. In the 1950s eminent individual scientists attended Pugwash
conferences aimed at constructively influencing governments and the
public.

3. P.M.S. Blackett's "The Scientist and Underdeveloped Countries" (pp.
47-64): The costs of industrialization exceed the ability of newly
independent countries. Rapid population increase exacerbates the
problem. Growth of cities in Italy and Northern Europe and mercentile
attitudes, including religious tolerance, provided the foundation for
scientific and technological advance. Science has not confirmed racial
superiority. Technical expertise offerred to non industrialized lands
requires adequate financing. Financial investment in such countries may
prevent significant harm to humanity.

4. Gerard Piel's "For the Living Generation" (65-84): Inequality,
beginning with slavery, attended technological advances. India seeks
democratic form and know how more than money. Agricultural advances
enable the US to export large surpluses to India, etc. further
stimulating the US economy. The cost to India would be significantly
lowered were fertilizer, were fertilizer production provided and the
Indian harvest increased. Further Indian industrialization would
further benefit India. This is possible.

5. C.F. Powell's "Priorities in Science and Technology for Developing
Countries" (pp. 85-112): Agricultural research, geological surveys
disclosing valuable resources and relevant education are priorities.
Higher education can avoid glamour and focus on applicable
requirements. Reducing armaments spending and investing in developing
countries' science enhances science's knowledge, experience and
potential human benefit.

6. Herbert Coblans' "The Communication of Information" (pp. 113-124):
In 1939 Bernal urged researchers have easily accessible documentation.
In 1958 he suggested abstracts are more essential than papers to most
readers. His concept of competent abstract writers and providers a la
Gmelin Institute challenges human preferences for the greater prestige
of actual research. Mechanical search will likely prove inadequate.
(This predates 21st Century computers -- MM)

7. Peter Kapitsa's "The Future Problems of Science" (pp. 125-139):
discovering light, strong alloy at 1,000 degrees C.; exploring
practical applications of polymers; nuclear reactions; expanding into
outer space; augmenting transformation of chemical to electrical and
chemical to mechanical power; understanding biological processes and
directed mutation of species; further quantatative study of social
sciences.

8. Alexander King's "Science International" (pp. 140-158): Previously
indifferent national governments now consider science important for
military purposes, economic prosperity and international prestige.
Complex expensive instrumentation requires national, even international
investment. United Nations efforts promote science in developing lands,
encourage global and regional scientific activity. There are various
regional organizations with a wide range of focuses and operational
procedures. In 1963 West Europe's science ministers met, considered
national and international science policies and science's role in
economic growth.

9. Joseph Needham's "Science and Society in East and West" (pp. 159-
188): China until the Fifteenth Century more efficiently than Europe
addressed human needs. A state bureaucracy organized a canal system,
irrigation, distribution of harvest, salt, iron and wine. Literacy and
reason were more prized than force and wealth. Slavery was rare.

   Wei meant the application of force, of will-power, the determination
   that things, animals, or even other men should do what they were
   ordered to do; but wu wei was the opposite of this, leaving things
   alone, letting Nature take her course, profiting by going with the
   grain of things instead of going against it, and knowing how not to
   interfere. This was the great Taoist watchword throughout the ages,
   the untaught doctrine, the wordless edict. It was summarized in that
   numinous phrase which Bertrand Russell collected from his time in
   China, 'production without possession, action without self-assertion,
   development without domination.' p. 179

Nature is investigated, applied, extensive mercentile intervention
inhibited.

10. J.B.S. Halldane's "The Proper Social Application of the Knowledge
of Human Genetics" (pp. 189-197): Outlined is understanding, popular
and scientific.

11. N.W. Pirie's "The Maldistribution of Research Effort" (pp. 198-213)
Original thinking is rare. Some who went into other fields would have
made good scientists. Women are not yet proportionately represented.
Human basic needs are few, but many are beguiled by fanciful wants.

12. R.L.M. Synge's "For the Good of Your Soul" (pp. 214-225): Current
high investment in science is largely for military and economic ends.

   the main public duty of the scientist is to know, a little more
   clearly than others, just where the boundaries of human knowledge
   lie. p. 219

A very great deal remains to be discovered. Much scientific work is
routinely monotonous. Needed are more support of education, awareness
of maternal responsibility and flexibility regarding part time study.

13. Maurice Korach's "The Science of Industry" (pp. 226-243): Each
science has theoretical and experimental aspects. Industry conducts
scale model testing, variables testing.

14. D.J. de S. Price's "The Science of Science" (pp. 244-261):
Historians of science are more historians than scientists. These
disclose the mythic nature of dispassionate, methodical scientific
advance. Scientists themselves rarely scientifically examined science.
J.D. Bernal's The Social Function of Science was the first significant
such study. Some statistical analysis has been done, of numbers of
Ph.Ds, of publications, etc.

   Although some 70 per cent of all scientists are in industry, they
   produce only 2 per cent of the scientific papers and only 33 per
   cent of the technical papers. p. 258

15. Stevan Dedijer's "Research Policy-From Romance to Reality" (pp. 262
to 284): Only this generation witnesses focused national attention on
scientific research. Such is recognized organizationally, including
with government ministers of science, even the prime minister holding
this portfolio, though dealing with only some limited research aspects.
Pressures for national rational research planning transcend political
ideologies.

16. J.D. Bernal's "After Twenty-five Years" (pp. 285-309): There is
awareness of the scientific revolution, the enormous gap it has created
between developed and undeveloped countries and of the threat to human
survival.

   If we can survive the dangers of the immediate present we have every
   chance of realizing a world so different from anything we have had
   before that the transition is greater than any which has occurred
   since the first appearance of humanity. We have the potentiality of
   abundance and leisure, but the actuality of a divided world with
   greater poverty, stupidity, and cruelty than it has ever known.
   p. 288

There has been increased energy efficiency combined with discoveries of
vastly increased energy resources. Computerization will alter the
concept of labour and permit scientific research to address more
effectively such challenges as life extension and curing incurable
diseases. Computerization enables swift provision of specific data and
enables popular scientific education.

Currently scientists emigrate accentuating imbalance. Global scientific
co-operation is ideal, hopefully to be more keenly realized.

   The powers of ignorance and greed distort science and lead it astray
   for war and destructive ends. p. 308

Pages 310-317 contain biographical notes on the eminent contributors.
