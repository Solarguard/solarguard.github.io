To Marion Zimmer Bradley

A new star is in the sky tonight,
A new voice in the wind blowing,
A new rose is gladly growing,
A new light in the sky so bright.

Our leronis has slipped away,
Left this world of mortals today.
To the Overworld she has gone.
Darker below the coming dawn.

She shattered chains and raised towers
Forbidden by former powers.
Great grey havens for battered hearts
Sprang from her laran and her arts.

Honour her in that youthful Tir
Among the spirits in the West.
We'll recall her priceless bequest
Given to her grateful heirs here.

Michael McKenny September 26, 1999 C.E.
