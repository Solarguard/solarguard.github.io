THE GREAT LAW AND THE LONGHOUSE, William N. Fenton, University of
Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1998

With chapter seventeen, this author begins his more historical
account of the Haudenosaunee. The first part of his book may be
summarized separately here in the future. Frankly, Fenton's English
prose rhythm was very jarring to this reader and at first proved
quite annoying, until finally a realization occurred. The key was to
take him more slowly, according often his clauses the weight of
sentences.

In this summary insulting designations are restricted to direct
quotations. The Longhouse People (Haudenosaunee) and Flint Folk
(Kanyen'kehaka) are appropriately identified in the summary proper.

Ch 17 (pp. 243-258): Champlain in 1603, etc. fought Flint Folk. St.
Lawrence trade began much earlier. In the early Seventeenth Century
the Dutch appeared on the Hudson River. Flint Folk thrust others
aside for direct trade with the Dutch. Haudenosaunee, especially
Kanyen'kehaka, attacked Huron trading convoys on the Ottawa River.

   Trigger (1986:186) has summarized the nature of Indian trade: "It
   is clear that in historical times all neighbouring tribes either
   were at war or traded with one another. Archaeological evidence
   reveals that for millennia trading...had been an important
   mechanism for maintaining peace and friendly contacts among
   tribes. It is also evident that intertribal trading did not take
   place in the absence of political alliances." Indeed, years
   later an Iroquois speaker at an English treaty affirmed: Trade
   and Peace we take to be one thing" (Wraxall 1915: 195). p. 245

Armed with European guns and yearning for trade, Longhouse People
destroyed Huronia and disturbed the Nipissing, Algonquins and others
in many directions. Flint Folk fought separately in some wars
without apparent League approval. Jesuit missionaries wrote on
language. They were impressed by Haudenosaunee protocol and
eloquence. Some titles are mentioned, including some of more recent
peace chiefs, but then applied to war chiefs.

Internal disputes there were. In 1656 Flint Folk killed two Seneca
envoys to the French. The condolence ceremony restored harmony. The
French invasion of 1666 led to twenty years of peace.

   The Mohawks were never the same afterward. Within three years, an
   emigration of converts to La Prairie (and later Caughnawaga) on
   the St. Lawrence carried off leading families, including the
   lineage of the first founder of the confederacy, Tekarihoken.
   Soon the manpower in the "praying settlements" would outnumber
   the stay-at-homes. These praying Mohawks became the eyes and ears
   of French governors, and neither the league nor English governors
   ever succeeded in repatriating them p. 253

Frontenac arrived in 1672, treated the Haudenosaunee well and was
impressed by their democratic practises, oratorical skill and
business acumen. Longhouse visitors to France disparged glaring
social inequalities and lack of charity. Frontenac's successor, La
Barre, led a force that fell ill and were mocked by a Longhouse
orator. In 1684 Denonville, La Barre's successor, attacked the
Seneca, burning the crops and stored food of four villages.

Ch 18 (pp. 259-268): The response saw the seige of Ft. Cataraqui and
the sack of Lachine. In traditional Haudenosaunee warfare,
responsible feminine insistence on the priority of the people's
future sought an avoidance of Haudenosaunee casualties and the
provision of captives for adoption as replacements for previous
loss. After 1675 there was a war deficit. While fighting memorably,
the Longhouse People also sought peace and the balancing of European
powers. Prominent leaders, confederacy title holders, can be
identified as participants in treaty sessions.

Colden's record of the 1690 is summarized, the failed naval attack
on Quebec mentioned and Frontenac unfavourably assessed for his
peripheral victories instead of a direct blow at Albany. The Ottawa
attacked Haudenosaunee hunters, "killing fifty-one and taking
twenty-one captive." p. 267

Ch 19 (pp. 269-276): begins with Dutch trade from 1613, though this
author rejects "the so-called Tawagonshi treaty of 1613" (p. 269)
and dates Flint Folk Dutch contact to after 1624. Early Dutch
Kanyen'kehaka contact was hostile. The Dutch refused to sell guns
until the English did by c. 1640. Flint Folk and Dutch agreed to
peace in 1643. This was reaffirmed in 1659 in the Covenant Chain.

Dutch observers were impressed by Kanyen'kehaka self-confidence and
skill. The natural annual cycle was noted. Dutch accounts describe
Flint Folk visiting and dining at Dutch residence. There were heavy
Kanyen'kehaka losses in fighting. Around 1660 came the first sale of
land, "the flats at Schenectady." (p. 275)

Ch 20 (pp. 277-295): mentioned are: Hotrewati (escaped Montreal jail
in 1658, envoy to French governors, the one who chided La Barre and
condoler of Frontenac in March 1699), Garakontie (from 1655-1677
energetic pro-French voice at Onondaga, convert to Christianity and
opponent of such traditions as dream guessing), Kondiaronk (The Rat,
Huron chief, inciter of French Haudenosaunee conflict, Christian
convert, participant in 1701 negotiations) and Teganissorens (keen
diplomatic speaker, able to speak persuasively to English and
French, losing his wife slain for alleged witchcraft).

These famous speakers for the Longhouse Council did not hold Council
titles. Title holders largely passed unnoticed. The Kanyen'kehaka
Tekarihoken was a war chief in 1653 and a successor migrated to the
St. Lawrence. The Oneida Odatshehde was held by father Milet in the
1690s.

Ch 21 (pp. 296-329): In 1664 Haudenosaunee agreed to peace with
England which had taken over New York. Dutch traders at Albany
continued, under English rule, as the main contact with the
Longhouse People. raiding continued in the backlands of other
colonies. A 1677 agreement with Maryland had to be renewed shortly.

Dongan sent Englishmen beyond the Senecas. Meetings in 1684 and 1685
included references to the Covenant Chain and Tree of Peace covering
Massachusetts, Maryland and Virginia, to the need to renew
agreements, to Susquehanna land ceded to Pennsylvania, to French gun
trading to Seneca enemies, to the difficulty sachems had restraining
the warriors and Dongan's suggestions, among which were encouraging
the Christian converts to return home and expelling Jesuits.

Fenton notes evidences of disharmony in the League. Christian Flint
Folk guided the French attack on the Seneca. There was some support
for France at the consultation at the Grand Council, but the
decision was to maintain the English alliance. Already, on August 5,
1689 1,500 Haudenosaunee had destroyed Lachine. Frontenac returned
in October 1689. There was discussion at Albany and Onondaga. Noted
is the practise of several people memorizing different parts of a
speech, conveying these before his reply to the orator and prompting
him if required.

Schenectady was sacked in return. A prompt pursuit rescued some
captives and slew some foemen. Condolence sought to uplift the
Europeans. Meetings there were with comments on the absence of help
from other colonies. Illness took Governor Sloughter and Tahaiadoris
a leading Kanyen'kehaka. War chiefs fell in battle. Governor
Fletcher's rapid response to the French attack against Flint Folk
centres earned him the name Swift Arrow. Christian Kanyen'kehaka
forsook the French and came home. Failure by the other colonies to
help encouraged a policy of neutrality by the Five Nations. A peace
mission was sent to Canada. Details were related at Albany in August
1694. A peace had been negotiated, subject to the governor's
approval. Fletcher was not amused. The Haudenosaunee were divided.
War parties went out. Frontenac advanced and rebuilt Ft. Cadaraqui.
Thence he struck at Onondaga. Even the New York council had refused
funds for troops to resist. Afterwards, before renewing the Covenant
Chain, the Haudenosaunee insisted a map of Canada they provided be
sent to the king of England.

   These campaigns, as one scholar has written, "combined with
   disease, had taken a terrible toll of their ranks. At the
   beginning of the struggle for the west their warriors had
   numbered some 2,800; by 1698 they were reduced to 1,320" of whom
   1,000 were Senecas (Eccles 1964:201). Meanwhile, the population
   of New France rose from 10,523 in 1688 to 12,786 ten years later.
   Peace was the only alternative for the Iroquois p. 329

Ch 22 (pp. 330-348): Neither France nor the Haudenosaunee had been
able completely to defeat the other. Each saw advantages to keep the
other as a balance to the English. La Potherie and Cailliere are the
primary sources for the treaty of 1701.

There was significant diplomatic activity during the 1690s with
individual Haudenosaunee nations sending envoys to Frontenac. the
sack of Onondaga and Oneida in 1696 and the end of the European war
in 1697 were followed by Frontenac's death in 1698. In 1700 an
embassy expressed condolence and explored peace. Gov. Calliere
insisted his Native allies be included and the treaty be held at
Montreal. In 1699 the English had strongly opposed Five Nations
peace with France. The issue of returning captives met the refusal
of some captives to leave their adoptive Haudenosaunee homes.

French envoys met at Onondaga. An arrogant English messenger
forbidding the Five Nations to meet with the French and ordering
them to Albany was ridiculed. He was told openly they were going to
Montreal to make peace and shown the five wampum belts confirming
the unanimity of the Five Nations. In April 1700 two English envoys
at Onondaga denied rumours of English poisonings, confirmed
intentions to build forts and presented invitations to a council at
Albany.

In Montreal in 1701 there was agreement over exchanging captives,
Haudenosaunee neutrality and the end of hostilities. There was a
grand ceremony on August 4, 1701 sealing the peace between France,
her allies and the Five Nations.

Ch 23 (pp. 349-360): Fifty Haudenosaunee leaders met Governor
Bellomont at Albany in late August 1700. There was discussion on
building a fort at Onondaga, on making peace, on getting rid of
Jesuits and bringing in Anglican ministers, of regulating the fur
trade and of sending children for White education, etc. Bellomont
died in 1701. When his successor, Nanfan, pressed the Haudenosaunee
about French moves in the west:

   The sachems confessed their inability to prevent the French from
   fortifying Detroit, and on 19 July 1701, the twenty sachems
   signed a deed to the English king quitting "for ever" title to a
   tract some eight hundred miles long and four hundred miles wide,
   including Detroit, which they alleged to have a acquired by right
   of conquest. They thought they were putting the land under the
   protection of the English crown. p. 356

Such early commentators on the Haudenosaunee as Captain Hyde,
Cadwallader Colden, Bruyas and Lafitau are mentioned.

Ch 24 (pp. 363-381): Despite Queen Anne's War in Europe, the
Longhouse People and the French wanted peace. French missionaries
returned and a French smith repaired weapons at Onondaga. An
Anglican missionary, Thorgood (sic p. 366) Moore, lasted but a year.
In 1709, despite failure to agree, some Haudenosaunee prepared to
assist a British invasion of Canada. This, however, was not
launched.

Three Flint Folk and a Mahican went with Peter Schuyler to see Queen
Anne in 1710. They requested missionaries and action against the
French. They were lionized spectators at London theatres, puppet
shows, cock fights. Portraits were painted of the Native "kings."
The 1711 British thrust at Canada was dismal. Anglican missionary
William Andrews served from 1712 to 1719. Later missionaries Henry
Barclay and John Ogilvie are mentioned.

Ch 25 (pp. 382-397): There is mention of six Nations in the 1710
London visit (though Fenton considers not that Nicholas's Mahicans
might be the sixth), but 1723 is when officially this designation
begins. The Tuscaroras fought bitterly in 1711-1713 and for much of
the century moved north. Treaty sessions are described and
Haudenosaunee insistence at meeting the English at Albany.
Tuscaroras were hostile to the English. The missionary Andrews was
advised to avoid them. In 1722 Longhouse People agreed to stay west
of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The French quickly built a fort at
Niagara. The Tuscaroras settled separately, were treated as
subordinates and their settlements split in supporting the
contenders in the Revolution.

Ch 26 (pp. 398-415): In 1732 Philadelphia became a treaty place.
Great land swindles occurred. Condolence on leaders' deaths was very
important throughout the Eastern Woodlands and Great Lakes regions.

   The interests of both Albany and the lower Iroquois focused on
   the French threat, while the upper Iroquois, or western members
   of the confederacy, looked to the south. This division of
   interests helps explain the want of Mohawk participation in
   Pennsylvania treaties. pp. 401-402

Noted are concerns for land, about dishonest traders, about the
presence of smallpox, about Haudenosaunee authority over other
Native peoples. Virginia wished Longhouse people to meet there, but
that was not a meeting place. In 1738 nine sachems died of smallpox.
There was not unanimous agreement to a French fort at Niagara. There
was hunger.

The 1742 Pennsylvania treaty is considered in several pages and some
significant points made:

   Clearly, Canasatego's rhetoric on this occasion exceeded logic or
   precedent. There is no historical record that the Iroquois
   Confederacy ever conquered the Delawares, unless it occurred in
   prehistory. And on several known occasions, Iroquois sachems
   protested that they could not sell lands without the sanction of
   the women. p. 414

Ch 27 (pp. 416-433): The clash of Haudenosaunee and settlers led
Conrad Weiser as Virginia's representative to go to Onondaga in 1743
to condole the dead, bury hostility and invite the Six Nations to
Lancaster. At formal council this was done. The 1744 treaty at
Lancaster 22/6/1744-4/7/1744 confirmed peace, but allowed
contentious settlement into Ohio.

   The Lancaster treaty conformed to a pattern of sequence that
   governed other such negotiations. Traditional council-fire
   protocol governed the proceedings: the formal invitation, the
   time appointed, the delegates selected, their travel and
   approach, their reception at the landing, their conduct to the
   treaty site, and the procession into town. Ritual hedged the
   entire event. After the preliminary welcome, the visitors
   withdrew and camped apart by nation, establishing a temporary
   village, a replica of Onondaga, where they could council apart.
   Preliminaries settled who would speak first, and the Iroquois
   requested two days to rest. Parties to a treaty had to have
   Indian names and be properly condoled and charged. A treaty
   involved a formal agreement. The hosts hung the kettle for a
   concluding feast. Valedictory speeches sealed mutual amity. A
   climactic dance united the participants. p. 423

At this treaty the orator Canasatego recommended to the colonists
the example of the Longhouse People's Confederacy.

Ch. 28 (pp. 434-447): The 1744 treaty conference impressed some
colonials, aroused English and Colonial interest in the Six Nations
and was included among forty five pre Revolutionary treaties
published. Further negotiations arose from French English conflict
and fears both of English attacks on the Longhouse People and of Six
Nations on the English colonists. The Confederacy largely sought
neutrality. In 1746 the English swayed those attending a conference
at Albany. Smallpox marred the proceedings and cut down many
Natives, effectively halting the response by the Flint Folk to
urgings they take the side of the English.

Ch. 29 (pp. 448-464): In 1746 William Johnson, at home in Flint Folk
culture, went to Onondaga on behalf of New York Governor Clinton. In
1747 Mississaugas sought peace with the Longhouse People. The policy
of neutrality fractured. The council could not control warriors
intent on supporting England. On Shikellamy's death Scaroyada was
appointed successor, but stationed in Ohio, not Shamokin. The French
reasserted themselves in Ohio. Canasatego and a large delegation to
Pennsylvania were told they weren't welcome. Unable to produce
written confirmation of that, Weiser led them to Philadelphia. There
Canasatego's concern about illegal settlements, land values and the
murder of his nephew met appropriation of land title beyond his
awareness.

Thomas Lee failed to unite the colonies and the Confederacy. Weiser
went to the Six Nations seeking peace for the Catawbas. Canassatego
died and Weiser participated in the condolence ceremony. Allowed to
speak, his encouragement that chiefs go to Fredericksburg failed. He
observed increased French influence. In 1751 Governor Clinton did
not impress the Longhouse People by his failure to follow council
protocol, nor by his reluctance to deal with William Johnson. In
1753 Clinton was informed the Covenant Chain was broken.

Ch. 30 (pp. 465-480): Clinton's continued inability to deal
responsibly with Natives and even with Conrad Weisar led to his
replacement. The French disdainfully rejected Haudenosaunee
warnings. Johnson went to Onondaga and was thanked for speaking in
the traditional Haudenosaunee way. Benjamin Franklin's admiration of
the Six Nations is noted, but Fenton feels some modern views for the
Longhouse People influencing the US constitution excessive. There
was a council to mend the broken chain. William Johnson was
appointed and assumed duties as representative to the Haudenosaunee.
He welcomed people to his estate, where he exemplified traditional
protocol and hospitality. More than a thousand came to his
conference starting on June 21, 1755. He did not gain many warriors
for Braddock whom the French defeated. Although Johnson failed to
capture Crown Point, he won a battle and was awarded a baroncy.

Ch. 31 (pp. 481-495): 586 Haudenosaunee, including Senecas, and
allies came to Johnson's place on February 18, 1756. Traditional
procedure and symbolic language were employed. There possibly the
largest wampum belt and largest pipe were presented. The
Kanyen'kehaka, as head of the confederacy, were entrusted with
handling landless Delawares and Shawnees. Pennsylvanian Quakers
surprised Scaroyady in January 1756 with a white wampum for peace.
They attended the 1756 gathering at Eaton, spoke in favour of
Natives and provided customary gifts to the Natives attending. There
was reciprocal talk of peace, if Pennsylvania respected Native
territorial integrity. The Seven Years War broke out and Johnson
employed the structure of the Confederacy to oppose the French.
