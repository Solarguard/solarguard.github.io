THE SCHOLARS' PRIMER (AURAICEPT NA N-ECES), ed. George Calder,
Four Courts, Blackrock, Dublin, 1995 (1917).

A book nearly attired with the mantle of a sacred divinatory
scripture within Celtic Neo-Paganism, a religious environment
normally including the absence of scripture among its definatory
characteristics, invites prefatory textual remarks.

Classical authors seem agreed that the spirituality of the pagan
Celts led them to refuse the limitations of the written word. Hence,
these Celts appear to have avoided that fundamentalism which has
blighted the great monotheistic and text based religions, generating
such tragic mockeries of ethics as acting on a literal insistence on
passages, including, "Thou shalt not permit a poisoner" (witch) "to
live," and "O rulers" (men) "of the House of Justice."

In religion, as in scholarship, a broad open minded tolerance seems
least likely to precipitate future replications of such
reprehensible behaviour. And, surely it is not beyond the bounds of
possibility that any spirits (ancestral, natural and/or divine)
seeking to communicate through a diviner could have the awareness to
make use of that diviner's understandings, rather than the
apprehensions of those looking on, or not even present.

Although the words within THE SCHOLARS' PRIMER were written down
centuries ago, they were written down long after the earliest known
ogham inscriptions. The thoughts of the bright minds creating this
text cannot be proven to correspond to the concepts of those earlier
users of ogham, to say nothing of the earliest and very likely
prehistoric inventors of the system. Perhaps, from very early times,
ogham already was employed in a manner corresponding to the familiar
tables of the modern ceremonial magician. Such, however, is one
speculation and it cannot be exclusively and absolutely proven that
the literate authors of THE SCHOLARS' PRIMER had such concepts in
mind, or that, even if they did, their perceptions in the Christian
period really bore much relationship to the considerations of
pre-monotheistic users of ogham.

Having attempted the above Celtic caution on dealing with the
written word, here follows an initial look at the English portion of
the book. There are, of course, grave aspects of dealing with
translated material, as the citations above about "poisoners" and
"rulers" clearly attest.

The book begins with a preface stating that current events in 1916
have adversely impacted on Celtic studies, that the book is
published anyway, albeit with a shortened preface, and offering the
customary thanks to others.

The introduction (pp. xix-lvi) begins with the identity of scholars
with poets, with the wide expanse of the poet: "poetry, romance,
history, biography, geography, grammar, antiquities, and law." (p.
xix). It mentions the poetic guild, the modern outlawing of poetry
and the use of satire. It lists the poetic curriculum over a twelve
year period and the seven grades of poet, with their metres and
entitlements.

Next is the influence of the Latin grammarians on the work, its
similarities to and differences from Latin grammars, the presence of
text and commentary, references to material treated indicating that,
though what survives is in Middle Irish, Old Irish is being
considered.

There follows traditional authorship, principally: Cenn Faeled (d.
679 CE p. xxvii), Ferchertne, Amergen, Fenius. Two further works,
Duile Feda and Cin Ollaman, are mentioned. The issue of the high
level of Irish learning in the Dark Ages is addressed and a passage
from Jordanis (c. 550 CE) adduced for the migration of scholars from
chaotic Europe to Ireland. Zimmer's identification of Ferchertne
with Maro the Grammarian (473-521 CE) is cited and rejected.

   Maro's tract had a profound influence on the Auraicept, but none
   on its early stages. According to internal evidence Cenn Faelad
   wrote the part ascribed to him about the middle or second half of
   the seventh century. That is the superior limit. The inferior
   limit lies in the eleventh century, or perhaps the tenth, and is
   determined generally by two facts--(1) that the Auraicept is
   found in two families of MSS., the variations in which postulate
   many generations of scribes, and (2) the immense development
   which has taken place in the tract itself as it has advanced from
   crude statements to a prosody which is exceedingly complicated
   and difficult. p. xxxi

Also, Irish grammarians are named in the text according to surnames,
such surnames not dating before the tenth century.

The influence of Isidore of Seville's ORIGINES on the Auraicept is
treated for the next nine pages. There follows the influence of Maro
the Grammarian, especially on the Trefhocal.

There is a brief look at each of the oghamic fives: stating F is
pronounced V in inscriptions, mentioning that the H group can be
remembered by counting from one to five (in Irish, of course),
noting the absence in inscriptions of initial H and of the letter
STR. The system is described clearly on pages 71 and 73:

   This is their number: five Ogmic groups, i.e. five men for each
   group, and one up to five for each of them, that their signs may
   be distinguished. These are their signs: right of stem, left of
   stem, athwart of stem, through stem, about stem.

Pages 2 to 169 present the Primer in both Irish and English
translation. It is in the form of questions and answers, with the
responses often beginning with the phrase "Ni ansa" ("Not hard").
Several layers of text and commentary can be discerned. Briefly,
this is a grammar demonstrating the influence of Latin and of
Christianity. There is the embroidery of Latin stitched into the
text, Latin text often being introduced by an expression such as,
"As the Latinist says," and Irish is contrasted with Latin (for
example, longest words in Irish are eight syllables long, in Latin
there are thirteen syllable words, fiannamailcecheterdarai and
anrocomraircnicsiumairne vs honorificabilitudinitatibus p. 111). As
to Christian influence, the origin of the Irish language is, of
course, traced to the Tower of Babel. Not surprisingly, the Irish
authors of this text consider their tongue the select speech of the
seventy two languages that are the consequences of the building of
that Tower. It is asserted that Irish has a richer vocabulary than
Latin.

This is also a poetic primer advising the reader not only on
grammatical inflections, etc., but also on poetical classifications,
poetical lapses and their remedies, the entitlements of the
different grades of poets, etc.

The scholarly mind's fascination with number, etymology and
genealogy is evident. Among specific points mentioned are: the Tower
of Babel was seventy two paces wide (p. 21), there are three hundred
and sixty five herbs and the three hundred and sixty five measures
of poetry (p. 151), the word filid comes from philosophus (p. 51),
Tuthmes (Thuthmosis) was ruling when Troy fell (p. 85) and Gaelic
takes its name from, "Gaedel, son of Ether, son of Toe, son of
Baracham, a Greek" (p. 17).

This review focuses mainly on ogham. Very understandable is the
medieval grammarian's concern with letters and ogham does receive a
fair amount of attention in these pages. Of course, there is legend
such as the tale of ogham being the final and more perfect product
of Fenius Farsaidh, whose preliminary efforts were the Hebrew, Greek
and Roman alphabets. Of interest is the assertion that some of the
trees from which some claim ogham names derive are currently
unknown (p. 89).

   For there are four classes of trees, to wit, chieftain trees,
   peasant trees, herb trees, and shrub trees; and it is from these
   four that the Ogham vowels are named. Chieftain trees, quidem, to
   wit, oak, hazel, holly, apple, ash, yew, fir. Peasant trees, to
   wit, alder, willow, birch, elm, white-thorn, aspen, mountain-ash.
   The shrub trees here, to wit, black-thorn, elder, spindle-tree,
   test-tree, honeysuckle, bird-cherry, white-hazel. Herb trees, to
   wit, furze, heather, broom, bog-myrtle, lecla, to wit, rushes,
   etc. pp. 89 and 91.

Among specific points of interest are: alder is used for shields,
ash for both spear shafts and weavers' beams, holly is one of three
woods in chariot wheels, broom is "physician's strength" (p. 93).

The Ogham tract and its translation appear on pages 273-313. This
begins by identifying Ireland as the place of ogham's invention, by
stating that Ogma invented it and by classifying the trees:

   How many groups of Ogham? Not hard. Three, viz, eight chieftain
   trees, eight peasant trees, and eight shrub trees. Eight
   chieftain trees first:--alder, oak, hazel, vine, ivy, sloe,
   furze, heath. Eight peasant trees, viz, birch, quicken tree,
   willow, ash, whitethorn, whin, apple tree. As to their letters
   all other shrubs are peasant trees. p. 275

It likely escapes not one familiar with the runes that the elder
Futhark is perceived as being composed by three eights.

At the outset of the following preliminary listing of kennings or
pithy references to the ogham letters, it ought to be noted that
Damian McManus in his A GUIDE TO OGAM spoke of, "The creations of
idle schoolboys," (p. 138) though this in the context of the ogham
tables later in the text. Still, the wordplay encountered in the
kennings, in what often feels like commentary, rather than text,
often seems to confirm his assessment. It is not impossible that the
meditations of inspired diviners would have a very different flavour
than many of these kennings.

McManus himself questions the system wide application of tree names.
However, a system of writing that rises from the ground, is three
dimensional (carved on two sides of a stone using the edge as trunk
from which to append the appropriate number of branches) and calls
its letters "trees" resonates as one that did, indeed, quite likely
very early, if not originally, have trees corresponding to the score
letters. The five diphthongs, found only in later manuscripts and,
indeed, being much less of a challenge for a writer than a carver,
are clearly later additions.

With this typically Celtic caution in mind, let us proceed to an
attempt to list the kennings, more as an effort to convey what is in
the manuscript, than to suggest divinatory significances of the
ogham letters. For Michael McKenny's feelings on that check out:

Another section of the text is the attribution of the letters of
the ogham to various categories, such as colours, names of churches
and rivers. Such a listing can suggest, as it perhaps did to Damian
McManus that we have the evidence of schoolboys with too much time
on their hands. It can also indicate to some that ogham was used in
the manner of the Hebrew alphabet by the modern ceremonial magician.
Either theory is valid, though neither validly excludes the other or
different opinions.

In concluding, the most striking passages in the book for this
reviewer were those referring to holly (the eighth ogham letter) as
a third of a wheel and classifying the ogham into three sets of
eight trees, thus having twenty four letters (pp. 91, 91 and 93 and
275). These passages raise the possibility that in the eleventh
century C.E., if not earlier, there was consciousness of the runes
by at least some of those studying ogham, and it would seem also
conceivable not only that some effort at correspondences between the
runes and the ogham may have been attempted, but that we have what
can be suggested as evidence for the possible use of ogham in
runic-like divination a millennium or more ago.

This review is the result of a first look at THE SCHOLARS' PRIMER.
Future readings will likely enhance and modify the content of the
review. The book itself remains a foundation for ogham studies, with
traditional Celtic textual cautions.
