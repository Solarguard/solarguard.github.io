<H1>South-East Asia</H1>

The vast area of South-East Asia, whose complex cultures, even in early times, displayed the harvest of local, Indian and Chinese influences, more recently has been enriched by Islamic and Western arrivals and by growing global awareness. At present, this site contains Michael McKenny's review of three books on the region and of one spectacular film. There is also a valuable link. It is intended, as this site develops, to more fully survey the rich history, literature and spirituality of South-East Asia. Various national histories (including Agoncillo and Guerrero's History of the Filipino People) and literary works await perusal and review. One already read and enjoyed has been the English translation of Sanya Polprasid's The Edge of the Empire. The concept (providing the Thai people with their Aeneid) was grand and the book deserves wider awareness in the English reading world. This section was last updated on April 11, 2008 with rearrangement and categorization of files and minor edits.<p>
