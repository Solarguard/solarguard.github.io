THE BEAST MASTER, Andre Norton, Ace, 1959

This is the story of an elite special forces agent, Hosteen Storm,
trying to start a new life on the frontier world of Arzor following an
interstellar war that saw the Terran alliance successful, but its home
world destroyed.

Storm is the human member of a telepathically linked team that includes
several animals (horse, eagle, two meerkats as large as pumas). They had
formed a special forces unit in the now ended war. Storm is a Native
American, a Navajo, one very sympathetic to the aboriginal inhabitants
of Arzor.

He becomes involved in interesting events in the backlands and
encounters evidences of the fascinating Forerunners, previous star
farers. This is a well written glimpse of Andre Norton's galactic
civilization, a portrayal of a young, self reliant hero facing danger
and discovery in an interesting place.
