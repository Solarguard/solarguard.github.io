RAINBOW Michael McKenny

Chapter Twenty Two Sacrifice

Suddenly, a strange thought came to me, as comes even in the desert
a cooler breeze at evening. What means this word "Master?" There
flashed through my mind the image of a wise old easterner, whose
physical sight had gone, but whose spiritual vision had risen higher
than the sky. He walked with the aid of a cane. He held a magical
staff and his face was African. He had a long white beard and his
hair was the colour of snow, while his penetrating eyes were as
azure as the sky. His aged coppery wrinkled face lay beneath a
headband and an eagle feather. A thousand different faces filled the
word master, Frazer and Jung's mythic archetype of the sage, the
wise old man.

It sensed my thought. I could feel it recoiling from it. something
in all these faces of the real masters of humanity, those who had
mastered the most difficult thing of all, their own desires, greatly
disturbed this self proclaimed master of the universe. It pulled
back. I could feel the essence of its being shaking as though it
were a cat tossed into a bath tub. However, if I expected any
lengthy respite, I was doomed to disappointment. Only three
microseconds I was allowed to relax freed of the pressure of its
presence. Then, again it swept towards me.

This time it reached out to grab hold of me, and not just to dangle
my physical form in its grip. Nay, it wanted to hold my soul within
its abominable psychic grasp. I could feel the flames seething
within my brain. I could feel my mind writhing and wailing in agony
within the grasp of its omnipotent thoughts and will.

"Now thou knowest," came its grinning thought, "what is the real
meaning of the word master. Also, thou art learning who is master
here and who is slave. Now thou perceivest the futility of further
struggling with thy sovereign superior."

Then it hurled at me a terribly tormenting thought. As I was from
this planet, it would bestow a great honour upon me. It didn't wish
to continue to use either largely illusory forms drawn from the
fauna of this dimension, nor to attempt to maintain the life support
here of a body so utterly alien to this habitat. There was clearly
one solution. The answer was for its mind to enter into and dwell
within a host body from this world. It had chosen me for this
special honour. And as it intended to live here forever, that meant
that I would have an eternal awareness of its tenantship and control
of my body. I would always be conscious that I was the host of the
master of the universe, and there would never be anything I could do
to free myself from that role, nor to impede, in the slightest
degree, the least thing it wished to accomplish, the least
abomination it desired to commit, as it used my body.

"Thy time has come," it thought at me. "I'm arriving this instant.
Ready thyself to receive thy true master." I could sense its keen
vision of the process of its occupation of my mind and body, from
the kinetic activation of the first electron and erg of the mind
transfer, to the walling off of the centre of my will in an area of
my brain and spirit apart from the motor and control centres of my
brain and being. Almost at once I felt it begin the process, and
what was only a plan, an intention, a design, began to unfold as
actual reality.

My will, my spirit, all that really was I, dropped rapidly back from
the surface of my own brain. Despair and utter hopelessness seeped
down, the advance guard of its occupying thoughts. A hundred
thousand visions of the atrocities it would in future commit, while
it wore my form, thronged behind the initial depression as black as
any night of the soul. I could do nothing to thwart its aim. My
conscious mind buckled before it.

Then from the depths of my spirit, from the inmost heart of my
unconscious, into my awesomely oppressed mind, sprang six syllables
in the sacred dialect of the forest dwellers of Gvihlih-hih.

"Ay-yar ih Ay-yar nih!"

There is no more potent spell, no greater power in that tongue or in
any other in the known universe.

As the call of the nightengale, as the wafting of attar of rose, as
the taste of honey, as the sight of a butterfly's wing, as the touch
of the finest silk, as the occult awareness of samadhi rose the
thought patterns of those six syllables. Across the essence of my
being permeated those soothing syllables and the myriad of
associated correspondences.

The master of all demons had already begun the transformation of its
potential to possess my being, body and soul, into kinetic
actualization. Its vast and alien being had begun the initial stage
of its merging with me. Already it possessed the fringes of my
being. Into those edges of my mind was wafted this sweet hexagram,
was radiated this light filling each of my six senses, completely
permeating them with the god name of the creator of all that was
good, better and best.

I felt Kaylooree's mental gasp of astonishment, bewilderment and
fear. This was the last thing it had imagined it would encounter
here. And all the positive images that filled my being, of the ever
creating, all merciful, omnipotent god were perceived by the would
be usurper of heaven and Earth as mirror images, as visions of
absolute horror and dismay. So very well it could access its own
distant memories of the god of the Gvihlih-hihns, of the single time
it had encountered one who could frustrate its will, one who could
chase it back to its lair, one who could, indeed, master it.

I could feel its mind, its being, its soul lurch as if stung, halt
and fall back, abandoning its attempt to take me over. In the most
fleeting of moments, it was completely gone. My mind was free, and
instantly filled with the hexagram of the god name. I basked in my
deliverance. I rejoiced in my liberation. I was happy to be free.

Above the white covered surface of the continent of ice and snow, an
overgrown arachnid roared with the voice of a prehistoric dinosaur.
The lightless limbs of the creature of night flailed in impotence
and rage. I could read its fury that I, who had chased it from my
mind, thought nothing of my victory. Really, it had not been by my
ability or action that I was preserved from it, save to use the
Terran term. It had been a deed of the Prime Mover. With vehemence
the huge spider before us thrust that thought aside. It much
prefered to believe that a human being could best it, than to yield
any acceptance on this other planet of the power and authority of
the one god who guards the people of the forest of Gvihlih-hih.

For the shortest of moments, I felt the thought flicker through its
mind, that any one of my colleagues would do as a host. However, as
it reached out to scan them for a more convenient subject, it found
each of them was mentally encased in the grip of the very same
hexagonal god form as was I. On reading its intent, each of them had
responded to the imminent psychic attack by the simultaneous
activation of the most powerful magical glyph, of the most mighty
paen to the Light in all the worlds we know.

And on top of the overwhelming joy I felt at my deliverance from the
role this Satan had destined for me, came the wondrous thrill of no
longer being alone, at being aware of the other wizards and what
they were thinking.

"Welcome back, Green," came Violet's melodious thought. She sent a
thrilling musical visual, a purple tear in the shape of a heart that
was singing an ancient song of delightful greeting. This quickly
turned into a violet smile that thanked me for rejoining her and the
others. Each of the other wizards projected a welcome, though none
was as highly emotional as Violet's. I could read her thought that
she had considered me dead and her frustration at a paralysis that
had kept her from attempting a rescue.

The creature was livid at the undeniable reality that something it
had intended could not be brought to pass, because the will of
others lay opposed to its desire. Its response was to bring to the
forefront the first of those atrocities and dark designs with which
it hoped to initiate its reign in our dimension. To underline its
displeasure and to drill into us its potent capacity to do harm, it
projected these images towards our minds. We shielded ourselves, to
a degree, with the realization that it was still engaging in an
occult attack against us, and had but switched its tactics.

"Do you fools imagine," it projected, "that a mere word or simple
phrase will give you final victory? Do you think that it is my loss
that you refuse the honour of being my throne? Do you feel in your
utter folly that I have been in any way weakened by all that has
occurred? Can you crazy fools conceive for an instant that the
unfoldment of my sovereign will within this universe has been
delayed the least measureable chronological unit by anything you
have done?"

Actually, we could clearly discern that it was completely aware and
furious that those rhetorical questions could be answered otherwise
than it had purposed. We had undeniably hindered and delayed its
plan to dominate this dimension. Yet, in its megalomania it was
denying that, and assuming it was convincing us of what it wanted to
believe. This did not make it any less dangerous or decrease in any
way the peril it represented to this planet and its people.

"I am right on schedule," it projected. "I will now proceed with my
plans for this world and its miserable solar system. After I have
dealt with it, I will go and fetch you on your backward and deprived
home planet, if you are still alive there." It was clear that it
wished us to be satisfied with our partial victory of escaping it
here, head home and leave it free to work its will on Earth, without
further opposition. Very transparently, it was projecting images of
the security of our own world, in the hope that it could induce us
to return there. This time it treated me as the Wizard of Green, the
dweller of the wizardly tower in the Southern Mountains and not the
individual who had been born on Earth.

"Why does it want a free hand here?" asked Red and I could feel our
strongest logical mind seeking to analyse this situation.

"Yes," projected Blue. "Just what does its grand design entail?"

"Let's find out," projected Indigo, along with the visual of a very
sharp sword cutting through a shadowy cloak.

"Agreed," projected Yellow and we did. At once, the image of a sword
leaped from Indigo's mind and plunged into the veiled thoughts of
the entity. Before it could erect any deflective or defensive
shields, we were through. The enormity it was preparing to commit
here stood exposed to our gaze. Displayed within our minds, in the
mental form of an architect's blueprints, was the devilish
premeditated design this prince of darkness had long crafted for
this fine planet, this first world in this dimension to fall into
its grasp, and the species dwelling upon this globe. It had been our
persistent pestering of it, which had so far delayed the
implementation of this great plan.

Now, however, it decided to proceed, whether we remained here and
were unsubmissive or not. If we remained, we would be spectators of
this first demonstration of its awesome and irresistible power. It
would show us and everyone else in this universe how grandiosly it
could plan. It would blaze with the heat of the sun. After all, was
it not the sovereign lord of that dimension the dwellers of Earth
called Hell? The heat it could generate itself would in a very short
time melt most of the ice of Antarctica. The resulting floods would
be just the prelude to the real testimony to its might and authority
in this dimension.

As soon as I perceived this despicable deed lurking within its mind,
I dared to project this thought to it, "The people of this planet
have an old legend that once long ago they were subjected to a world
flood and that they will never be called upon to suffer that fate
again."

It deigned to reply. "What do I care for the legends of this world?"
came its disdainful thought. "You have not reached far enough into
the grandeur of my plans. Yes, I will blaze with such heat as the
surface of this world has not known in ages. Yes, I can and will
melt the ice of this whole continent. It will take but an
insignificant fraction of the enormous energy which I control to
accomplish that. Yes, this melted ice will flood all the coastal
areas of the world. Yet, this is nothing, not even worth mention.
Why should I stop there? Why limit myself to that? For me, it will
be the simplest matter to burn through this planet's crust until I
reach the molten core. Once I am through that crust, once I am in
direct control of the molten interior that fiery matter can be
released.

"That, too, is a small accomplishment. It will be very easy to
project the particles from this burning world towards this system's
puny star, and follow it. I can then open another gate there and
draw on the power of my entire dimension to cause that star to nova.
That nova will be the clearest visible sign of the commencement of
my rule in this universe. Is not that something more worthy of
consideration?"

As the visual of its mental concept of that nova touched my mind, I
felt a shiver run up my spine and I sensed the curious fact that
each of my six colleagues was experiencing a similar tingling. Each
of us had the impression that Kaylooree's thoughts concerning the
destiny of Earth's sun were a foreshadowing of things soon to be
realized. Each of us was feeling that we had just glimpsed a
foretaste of the future.

"We cannot allow this to be completed," projected Indigo.

"You cannot alter the destiny I determine for this insignificant
sun. It will nova as evidence of my supremecy."

Curiously, an alteration in tone took place in the message my mind
received. "Yes, soon you will have irrefutable proof of how greatly
this entity can affect the destiny of this system's sun." Did this
continued and seemingly repetitive thought truly come from it? Was
it just an intensification of its attempt to sap utterly our will?
Strangely, I could not feel another wizard musing on these words,
until they were glimpsed in my mind.

"I guess the entity has hurled them only at me," I projected.

"Curious, though," projected Violet, "that it referred to itself as
the entity, rather than as the master or whatever."

"And," added Red, "that what I'm reading from your mind has a
totally different flavour to Kaylooree's normal thought patterns."

"Whatever it is," projected Blue, "we can bounce back any aspect
feeling like the sapping of our will."

"Yes," projected Orange, "let's prepare ourselves for an appropriate
response."

Kaylooree read our intent to oppose its great demonic design. For a
moment it hesitated, trying to decide whether it was worth the
effort to try to drive us away. It decided not to bother. We saw the
realization flit across Kaylooree's mind that even if we were chased
away, we could always return, even if we had to use time travel to
do so, to confront it anyway. I could almost see it shrug as it
decided to simply leave us be. We would have front row seats as it
conquered our universe.

We did not waste any time engaging in argument with it. Instead, we
began to plan and consult, at the maximum computer swift speed, of
which we were capable.

"This is not going to be easy," projected Orange.

"I'm working on a modification of the Thantay 2C spell," projected
Red.

Indigo projected a visual of a rainbow and the thought, "I think it
is going to come down to this in the end."

"The Terran myth," I projected, "is that the rainbow is the promise
Earth will never again be subjected to a world flood."

"Very intereseting," projected Violet.

However, I could follow Yellow and Blue's intuitive leap and Red's
sobering precise analysis. A touch of sorrow appeared in, and then
quickly disappeared from, Violet's mind. She quickly put it aside as
she got down to business. "Red," she projected, "I think we should
use its reference to time travel as a guide on how to dissipate much
of the excess energy we're going to have to handle."

"The complexity involved," projected Blue, "may exceed our
capacity."

As I watched the recalculations passing swiftly through Violet's and
Red's minds and sensed the reaction of the others, I realized that
our chances were not considered to be very favourable.

"Right you are," came Kaylooree's intrusive comment. "You do not
have a very good chance of success. So, you had all best get on your
way back to your own planet. Now, my full attention will be devoted
to implementing the grand design. If you interfere, as you
yourselves have figured out, you'll only die sooner, rather than
later."

"Perhaps," responded Indigo, "but some things are worth dying for."
As she thought this, the visual of what she was giving up flashed
within her mind. There, in breathless wonder, reposed the verdant
glade wherein she dwelt. There were the green leaves, the merry
flitter flies, scamperers and leaf trillers.

"Yes," projected Red, and I saw the Crimson Tower bathed in bright
moonlight and the awesome array of magical formulae painted upon so
much of the surface of that tower's circular wall in the
astonishingly harmonious and admirable calligraphy of a dozen dozen
Wizards of Red.

In succession came the continuing affirmations of the consensus of
the Council of Colours. There was a lonesome boat upon the sapphire
hued sea beneath a star spangled sky. There was a homely cottage all
arrayed in mosaic of yellow and gold. There was an orange tower by
the shores of the Sea of the Sunset. There was the lovely and
aromatic hedge of health. And, there, too, cast into the flowing
visual, as precious and as inadequate as the rest, was the domed
Tower of Green in the Southern Mountains. 

Yes, Indigo was right. Not one of us cared to leave now, even though
the odds clearly were more than eleven to one against us leaving
alive afterwards. We might be facing a likely death, but we were
going to try to stop the destruction of Earth and its sun.

As the trickle of a little creek came the thought how appropriate
that was for me. From very ancient times the magical motto, to use
the Terran term, of the Wizard of Green has been, "I'll try."

A strage feeling came over us as we readied ourselves. The matrix of
the spell formed in our conscious minds. Yet, below that conscious
surface, something seemed to be stirring, something that included,
though was not really comprised of an exquisite emotion. It was a
feeling midway between sorrow and joy, terrible tragedy and glorious
triumph. The thought sprang simultaneously into all our minds that
it was our intent to jointly sacrifice ourselves defending the
people of this alien world that was the crowning glory of the
evolution of the Gvihlih-hihn species. That a Terran stood here as a
ray of the rainbow was an embellishment of our honour.

So great a sacrifice, even at this stage when it was only an
intention, was more than enough to call forth a response from the
Fashioner of All. Here I seemed to hear the humourous voice that had
spoken once inside my mind when I wasn't dreaming.

"I am very proud of you. Do not imagine for an instant that what you
have intended will result in the destruction of my rainbow. That
would have been the consequence of your refusal to stand against
Kaylooree here. However, because you have chosen well, my rainbow of
light will shine higher on more planes and for longer ages than even
my colours of light can as yet conceive. The results of your
decision will be felt throughout all the planes of existence for
ages to come. You will perceive shortly what no one in this universe
could ever have believed possible. You may now proceed knowing that
you are right, and not only have divine approval, but divine
assistance. This is the turning point in the history of heaven and
of Earth and of all the regions in between."

Then, without foreknowledge or design, without even being aware of
what we were doing, our minds moved closer together. I felt, for an
instant, a smiling thought of Violet's concerning the colour of the
rainbow. And then I was aware only that we were a single entity
within seven physical forms.

All of our planning, the words we'd received from the forest god,
even our sudden fusion into a single being composed of seven minds,
seemed to have been missed by the would be ruler of the universe in
its preoccupation with its sinister designs. Now, holding clear in
its misguided mind, the matrix of the spells it planned one after
another to launch against Antarctica, Earth and the sun, it moved
from potential to active psychic energy.

The single rainbow responded to that flow. We also moved from
potential to kinetic mode. Without a thought for the morrow, knowing
only that this was our moment, we placed our bodies between the
enormous spider, now hanging fifty metres above the ground and the
ice above which it hung.
