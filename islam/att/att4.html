Tarikh al-rasul wa'l-muluk, Abu Ja'far Muhammad b Jarir al Tabari
(839-923), THE HISTORY OF AL TABARI, vol. xv, "The Crisis of the early
Caliphate, transl. and annotated by R. Stephen Humphreys, SUNY, Albany
1990.

Foreward: As empire expanded, internal divisions increased. Al Mada'ini
(for Iran), Waqidi and Sayf (for Arabia and Iraq) are at Tabari's main
sources. Waqidid seems overly crafted, Sayf popularly pious depicting
spiritual heroes. Prym's Leiden text was used, among its problems the
single Berlin ms for stretches, including the final eighty five pages.
Baladhuri was also consulted. He largely used Waqidi, in paraphrase to
at Tabari's direct quotation.

A.H. 24: Waqidi says Uthman became Caliph on November 5, 644, Sayf
November 9th. Uthman increased stipends, directed gaze heavenwards,
appointed Sa'd governor of Kufah and retained Abu Musa al Ashari in
Basrah. Al Walid ibn Uqbah triumphed in Adherbayjan and Armenia. Salman
reinforced Syria against Byzantines. Muslims won.

A.H. 25: Amr ibn al As retook Alexandria. Muslims thrust into the
Maghrib and Ifriqiyah (Tunisia).

A.H. 26: Uthman restored the sacred boundary stones around Mecca. Unable
to repay a loan, Sa'd argued with treasurer Abdallah ibn Mas'ud. Uthman
appointed al Walid ibn Uqbah to replace Sa'd.

A.H. 27: Abdallah ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Sarh conquered Ifriqiyah, killing its
leader and camping at Qayrawan to be. Disputes over booty led to his
removal. Spain was invaded by sea.

A.H. 28: Mu'awiyah conquered Cyprus. The treaty allowed payment of tax
to Muslims and Byzantines, required Cyprus inform Muslims of any
Byzantine attack and pledged the Caliph to appoint a Cypriot ruler of
Cyprus.

A.H. 29: Uthman appointed Abdallah ibn Amir governor of Basrah,
replacing Abu Musa. Fars rebelled and was retaken. Uthman prayed four
prostrations on pilgrimage. Some, including Ali, criticized him.

A.H. 30: Sa'id ibn al As attacked Tabaristan. Abu Shurayh al Khuzai, a
Companion of the Prophet, was killed in Kufah. His murderers were caught
and executed. Uthman purchased residences to serve as hospices in Kufah.
He encouraged people not to take the law into their own hands. He
punished innocent al Walid and appointed Sa'id governor of Kufah. Sa'id
reported the place tense from inequalities.

Uthman traded land in Iraq for land in Arabia. Uthman's signet ring fell
into a well. He had another made. Pious Abu Dharr was sent from Syria to
Medina. Predicting war, he moved to ar Rabadhah. Al Mada'ini says
Yazdagird fled this year.

A.H. 31: A large Byzantine fleet assailed the believers and was
defeated. There was grumbling against Uthman. Some say Yazdagird was
killed this year (pp. 78-90). Abdallah ibn Amir advanced through
Khurasan.

A.H. 32: Abd ar Rahman disregarded Uthman's advice and fell in battle.
Yazid ibn Mu'awiyah was killed fighting. Abu Dharr passed away alone.
Mada'ini says in this year al Ahnaf won victories and made standard
Muslim treaties in northeastern Iran.

A.H. 33: Dissensions in Kufah led some to be exiled to Syria. Mu'awiyah
failed to soothe them. Abd ar Rahman calmed at least one. Some were
exiled from Basrah.

A.H. 34: Men plotted. Uthman appointed Abu Musa governor of Kufah. Abu
Musa called for obedience and harmony. Uthman's governors advised
distracting external war, greater wealth distribution, justice. Ali
admonished Uthman for having relatives in high office and not
controlling them. Uthman defended his actions and condemned rumour
mongering.

A.H. 35: Abdallah ibn Saba, a convert from Judaism, opined Muhammad
would return. He intrigued against Uthman. Uthman's governors advised
the Caliph. Mu'awiyah warned Ali and others that unless spiritual
priority was heeded, former contention for leadership would re-emerge.
He urged Uthman to come to faithful Syria or to accept Syrian
bodyguards. Uthman declined both.

Uthman answered dissidents accusations on the four prostrations, grazing
prohibition, standardizing Koranic text, return of an exile, appointment
of young governors, ibn Abi Sarh's booty and nepotism. Dissidents urged
Ali, Talhah and az Zubayr to seize power. They refused. Dissidents
advanced on Uthman. He appealed to the garrison towns for aid. On a
Friday, as he stood at the pulpit, dissidents stoned him.

Other sources note Uthman's agreement to reserve the stipend for those
fighting, the departure of Egyptian dissidents, their angry return on
encountering the Caliph's messenger carrying their death warrants and
his talk of forgeries. Some say Uthman heeded Marwan's advice and lost
respect. Ali avoided him. He stood in the pulpit and was stoned. Jahiah
seized from Uthman the Prophet's staff, broke it over his knee and then
Jahiah's knee became infected from a splinter.

Uthman asked three days to address demands. Ali, intermediary with the
dissidents, accepted. Uthman used the time to try to gather forces.
Confronted he warned his death would permanently sever Muslim unity. He
refused to abdicate. He was killed on June 17, 656. Some fell defending
him. Marwan was wounded. Fatimah bint Aws interposed herself, preserving
Marwan's life and winning Umayyah gratitude.

Uthman's favouring of Quraysh relatives permitted Islamic factionalism
to thrive. He defended himself from accusations of innovation. He was
very wealthy, enjoyed dining well and was charitable. He preached
spirituality.

His body lay unattended for three days and was stoned when moved for
burial. There are remarks on the date of his death, age, ancestry, wives
and children, governors, physical appearance and there are verses
concerning him.

Brockett, SUNY, Albany, 1997.

Editors Foreward: This volume finishes A.H. 35 and treats A.H. 36. This
is the time of Ali's election and A'ishah's inspired opposition to him.
It raises issues of dissension still unresolved. The text continues its
single reliance on the Berlin manuscript. The translator writes of the
severe divisions herein recorded.

A.H. 35: There are various accounts as to who swore allegiance to Ali.
He delivered an uplifting sermon. He strove for calm, tried exerting his
authority and restoring harmony. Not all heeded him. Ali was advised to
confirm at once the governors. He refused. He appointed his own
governors. The Syrian and Kufan ones were turned back. The Basran and
Egyptian ones found their lands divided. Mu'awiyah rebelled.

A'ishah in Mecca learned of Uthman's murder and condemned it. She
stirred up a force opposing Ali. This proceeded to Basrah. Ali failed to
intercept her. He replied to criticism. In Basrah, A'ishah urged
revenge. Basrans split and hostilities broke out. A messenger to Medina
ascertained Talhah and az Zubayr were compelled to give allegiance to
Ali. Ali's Basran governor was defeated and imprisoned.

Talhah and al Zubayr defeated Uthman's killers and their associates,
only  Hurqus escaping alive, protected by his tribe. Talhah and az
Zubayr dispatched letters to Syria, Yamanah and Medina. A'ishah wrote to
Kufah. Ali warned of continuing sectarianism. He sent his son Hasan to
Kufah for aid. Ali welcomed some nine thousand who responded. There were
peace talks. A dream supported Ali. He calmed down some fighting. Some
withdrew from approaching battle.

Forces formed for battle and realizing peace should prevail dispersed.
Fearing reconciliation's punishment, Kufan opponents of Uthman launched
surprise attacks inciting battle. A youth holding aloft Ali's Koran was
cut down. Talhah and az Zubayr were killed. Details are related of
combatants and incidents. Seventy fell at A'ishah's howdah. She was
captured. Ali provided her with funds and escort to Medina. He mourned
the losses on both sides. He received allegiance from all Basrans.
Marwan went to Syria.

Ali appointed ibn Abbas governor of Basrah. He had appointed Qays ibn
Sa'd governor of Egypt. Qays read publically Ali's letter stating Ali
would cease Uthman's innovations and appointing Qays. Qays received
allegiance from all save a group in Kharbita village. He was lenient.
Mu'awiyah, failing to seduce Qays, made Ali suspicious of Qays. Ali
named Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr governor. Qays joined Ali, displeasing
Mu'awiyah. Kharbita beat off an attack sent by the new governor.

Ali sent an envoy calling Mu'awiya to allegiance. The envoy returned to
report Mu'awiyah had aroused deep anger over Uthman's killing, blaming
Ali.

vol. 17, "the First Civil War" transl. and annotated by G.R. Hawting,
SUNY, Albany, 1996

Translator's Forward (pp. xi-xxi): This volume continuing Ali's
Caliphate and its dissensions is a key to Islamic consciousness, one
keenly studied by modern scholars. Major sources are: Abu Mikhnaf (d.
157/774) cited by al Kalbi (d. 206/821) for Kufan events, al Mada'ini
(d. ca. 235/850) cited by Umar ibn Shabbah (d. 264/877) for events in
Basrah and Musa ibn 'Abd ar Rahman al Masruqi (d. 258/871-872). Noted
are issues concerning the manuscript, citations and translation.

A.H. 36: Ali and Mu'awiyah prepared for confrontation. Ali advanced over
the Euphrates. Soldiers fought, clashing for access to water. Ali urged
Mu'awiyah to preserve Islamic unity. Warriors contended.

A.H. 37: There was a truce during the month of Muharram. Ali then told
his forces to defend, not attack. The Battle of Siffin began. Off and on
it lasted for a week. Ali inspired his warriors. His right wing was 
pushed back. Ibn Budayl fell thrusting at Mu'awiyah. Al Ashtar came up.
Ali was pleased with the reformed right wing. Heroes, including 'Ammar,
died fighting.

Ali pushed up to Mu'awiyah challenging him to single combat. He declined.
All night raged the clangour. Amr suggested Mu'awiyah raise Korans on
Syrian spears. Ali unwillingly was forced by his fighters to respond and
accept arbitration. Prisoners were freed; the battle's dead were mourned.
Some of Ali's men considered human arbitration wrong. They opposed him. 
He offerred them continued prayer in the mosque, sharing of resources and
peace unless they started a fight. A number of them made their way to
Nahrawan.

The arbiters met. Amr tricked Abu Musa to announce the deposition of Ali,
while Amr proclaimed the supremecy of Mu'awiyah. Ali raised forces. The
misdeeds of the separatists diverted his attention to them. He quickly
defeated them. His army then largely melted away, rendering war with
Mu'awiyah impractical.

A.H. 38: Ali's governor in Egypt, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, rejected the
advice of his predecessor. Ali appointed al Ashtar who was poisoned. Ibn 
Abi Bakr was annoyed. Amr led an army to Egypt. Ibn Abi Bakr asked Ali 
for aid. Amr defeated and killed ibn Abi Bakr. Amr took Fustat.

Ali's envoy to Basrah, A'yan ibn Dubay'ah, was killed. Some Najijah
people opposed Ali and went towards Basrah. Pursued they held their own
and got away. A larger force defeated them. Ali's men went further, 
achieving greater victory, collecting tax and punishing apostates.

A.H. 39: Mu'awiyah raided across the border. Ali sent Ziyad who imposed
order and collected taxes in Fars and Kirman.

A.H. 40: A Mu'awiyah force took Medina, Mecca and Yemen. Ali accepted
Mu'awiyah's offer of a truce. Some men dissatisfied at the worldly 
wrangling of their leaders made a pact to kill Ali, Amr and Mu'awiyah.
Ibn Muljam stabbed Ali. Ali dying urged his sons to be spiritual.

Mu'awiyah, wounded by his assailant, recovered. Amr was sick and the 
assassin killed another man leading prayers. Outlined are: Ali's
appearance, ancestry, wives and offspring, governors and accounts of his
admirable conduct.
