Michael McKenny was born in 1950, the Year of the Tiger, in Ottawa,
Canada. He moved with his family across the Ottawa River in 1958, thus
growing up in the Province of Quebec. He attended St. Patrick's College
in Ottawa, taking three courses (Russian history and two Russian
language courses) at Carleton University, and graduated in 1971.

Studious, a voracious reader, he completed Ontario's High School Latin
program in two and a half years by correspondence and then proceeded to
obtain a BA Honours in Latin and Classical Civilization in 1989. His
poems, short stories etc. were published through the years. He was one
of the collaborators of PEACE IN THE ANCIENT WORLD (1981). He edited and
published BARDIC RUNES, Canada's magazine of traditional and high
fantasy, from 1990 to 1997.

Resonating intently to mystical and spiritual influences he has explored
a variety of religious paths. He is a universalist, believing the most
unacceptable thing in religion is intolerance.

He has used a variety of pen names, including Green, and, since March of
2004, Red.

He is grateful for being alive on this planet at this time, as the human
species faces the opportunity and the challenge to lift itself above its
previous conflicts into that awareness of its harmonious humanity that
in his estimation is the definition of intelligence.

Michael McKenny, September 15, 2006 C.E.
