(xiii-xv) Preface: Do we study periods or problems? This volume's imposed chronology dpes not completely cover the Renaissance. Exploring relationships between different fields (e.g. politics and economics) can be informative.

I.  (1-6) Introduction: In 1454, the future Pope Pius II wrote a pessimistic letter, lamenting the failure of European leaders to unite in opposing the expanding Turks. He also deplored the lack of respect accorded to both Pope and Emperor. There were clerical abuses. Reform proposals at recent councils had failed. There was a significant divide between scholastic, intellectual and mystical, emotional experience. The beginning of the Renaissance was not much felt outside Italy. Even Italians barely perceived growing tensions from a Classical focus and from economic transformation. Not unity, but self-centred competition, would lift European civilization to unimagined heights. Common European advances include local and regional varieties. Europe's frontiers shrank in the east and expanded in the west.
ii. (6-21) The Turkish Threat: The fall of Constantinople ended the some seven hundred year long Mediterranean three way stability of Islamic, Byzantine and Roman Christian spheres. Turkish Balkan advances presented the prospect of the end of Christian civilization. Toloerant Muhammad II made effective use of the twofold Ottoman education system (elite soldiers and administrators from converted sons of the conquered and Muslim born clerics, judges, scholars and teachers). Ottomans encountered some fierce resistance in the Balkans. They took Syria and Egypt and moved the Caliphate to Constantinople. Turkish sultans were restrained in their expansion. The West enjoyed superiority in technology. Constant talk of crusading against the Turks occurred, alongside less open attempts to get along. Arabs in the Seventh Century and Mongols in the Thirteenth appeared about to extinguish Christian Europe. Fifteenth Century Europe understandably felt their peril more severe, though their economy and military strength was actually far greater. Christian faith provided believers assurances that the Turks would not overwhelm all Western Civilization. Many Balkan peasants chose to move to the Ottoman Empire.
iii. (22-37) The Progress of European Discovery: China's dynastic change and Ottoman successes in Western Asia and southeastern Europe severed the land route used in the Thirteenth Century. Atlantic maritime explorations sponsored by Portugal's Henry the Navigator significantly began another way. His death in 1460 briefly halted voyages of discovery. A grant to merchant Fernando Gomes in 1469 resumed them. King John II directly focused on them. His explorers found the Congo (1484), then the Cape of Good Hope (1488), then after his death Vasco da Gama reached India and spices from even further east. Soon Portugese bases were established. Resistance, even joint Egyptian-Indian resistance (Battle of Diu 1509) was defeated. Spain backed Columbus's effort to reach Asia by sailing west around the world. In 1492, he reached the New World, known as America by 1507. Portugal's Cabral discovered Brazil in 1500. Spain's Cortes took Mexico c. 1520 and Pizzaro Peru barely a decade later. Spain first issued grants to conquerors, then had two New World governors (one for New Spain, one for Peru). It had one legal port in Spain.
    These two European thrusts, one east, one west, began the global extension of European civilization. The Chinese (who sent out impressive naval expeditions in the early Fifteenth Century) and Arabs did not follow up their advantages. Europeans were more curious, their rulers, more financially restrained, authorizing private ventures. Profit prospects inspired explorations. European competition (individual and state) was also a factor, the discoveries weakening Europe's sense of community.
iv. (37-42) The Title to Dominion and the Unity of Christendom: Canon law, the Papacy, and stable geography underlined European Christian identity. Altered borders weakened this identity. The Pope's dual political and spiritual roles presented him complications, including consulting the Sultan concerning the Ottoman pretender Djem. Muslim Turkish dominion within Europe was accepted. The Papacy's authority to decide European dominion (e.g.  dividing the world between Portugal and Spain) was less and less accepted. Religious, continent wide, identity was changing into individual state identity.

II i. (43-49) The Commercial Revolution: Control of trade shifted from the Mediterranean to Western Europe. The Arabs had been middlemen. Two main trade routes had permitted the Muslim rulers of Persia, Egypt and the Ottoman Empire to benefit from tolls, etc. Portugal's military supremecy let it replace them. Spain's king monopolized trade in New World gold, silver, etc. Low countries financial supremecy had them collecting a significant amount from Iberian debt. Antwerp became a major money market. Inflation occurred. Economic changes were gradual. Trade in lumber, wool, textiles, wines, etc. continued as since long before. Venice continued prosperous Mediterranean trade. As nations strengthened, the Hanseatic League declined.
ii. (49-56) The Devvelopment of Industry: The success and criticism of capitalism prompted attentive consideration of its origins and development. Early examples include: "Flemish and Italian textiles, the Venitian ship-building industry and English wool-growing." (p. 50) This period saw economic growth. New industries (e.g. printing) emerged. Older ones became more extensive. In both, workers were increasingly restricted in wages and opportunity for advancement. Strikes occurred. Silc production spread. Tours in 1470 had sixteen silk workers. In 1500, it had 4,800. Alum mining opened, or reopened in Italy. This soon became intricate and labor intensive. The Fuggers mined "copper, iron and silver." (p. 54) in Hungary and Tyrol. There were advances in mining technology. Governments sought control of mines. Some English mines were run by small partnerships. While industries grew, Europe remained largely an agricultural society.
iii. (56-60) Banks and Bankers: Commercial growth prompted increased credit access. Large banks (e.g. Medici and Fugger) had branches accross great distances. In part due to Lorenzo's preoccupation in other matters, the Medici bank was declining by 1500. The Fugger family had several generations of keen businessmen, whose interests included banking. While national leaders depended on bankers' loans (Charles V even using Fugger money to bribe electors to choose him Holy Roman Emperor), rulers determined policy and bankers lived in high style, including as great patrons of the arts. At the city level (e.g. Venice, Florence, the Hanseatic League) bankers and rich merchants were more in political control.
iv. (60-64) The Working of the Land: Economy was largely agricultural. Urban and population growth meant increased farming. An attractive wool market enticed some to  turn cropland into pasture. English enclosure of common land accelerated. While it caused hardship, it seems only three percent of arable land was enclosed. Royal support for Spanish sheep  growers led to significant crop land loss, negatively impacting Spanish agriculture and society. Such land transfer hardly occurred in France and Germany. 
v. (64-70) The Social Classes: The traditional religious, noble and laboring met emerging businessmen in an increasingly monetary environment. Previous social mobility within the religious class greatly declined. As land value diminished, benefices held by higher ecclesiastics multiplied. The lower clergy were mostly impoverished and kept frpm advancement. Some parishes lacked priests and had parishoners deficient in faith experience and understanding.  The landed aristocracy felt falling land values. Some sought court services. Some married a merchant's daughter. Others became impoverished title holders. Foreign adventures, such as French activity in Italy from 1494, offered nobles opportunity for gain.
    Earlier middle class people (e.g. guildsmen, etc.) felt outclassed by new rising merchants. They felt a need for new religious certitude. Successful merchant families sought land. A noble's daughter, a son in the Church. There were the urban poor and the peasants. Peasants may have been better off than in previous generations, but were more dissatisfied. Actual change prompted criticism of traditional structures. The ideal existed that the virtuous man could rise, though still within traditional nobility. 

III i. (71-75) Types of Political Authority: People then considered governance more important than economic activity. They did not have a Twentieth Century understanding of the state with its precise borders. Previous attitudes persisted, though Pope and Emperor had each lost influence as universal authorities. There were firm city states. There were larger states based on personal loyalty. Nations were rising, not yet fully percerivd as corresponding to states. In 1450, Spain had at least four states: Aragon, Castile, Leon and Navarre, not to mention Grenada. Three key questions are: territory, government function and interstate relations. Who in 1458 could have imagined that in sixty years there would be the Hapsburg power, Spanish union, French expansion, English dynastic consolidation and Slavic failure to unite?
ii. (75-90) Western Europe: Consolidation of Nations, especially Ferdinand's Spain, Henry VII's England and Louis XI's France, can be contrasted with the failure of Burgandy, whose Charles the Bold, died without the title of king and lacking a male heir. The remnants of his lands produced only the small nations of Belgium and the Netherlands. Some historians inappropriately contrast a medieval Charles with a modern Machiavellian Louis XI. Louis gained from Charles's lack of a male heir, Emperor Maximilian's weakness and the deaths of Renee of Anjou and Charles of Maine. 

"At the end of his reign Louis XI had therefore, by a fortunate combination of accident and policy, nearly      doubled the domain of the crown, consolidated the territorial basis of the monarchy and created a position from which the power of the great vassals could be more easily overthrown." p. 82 
                      
    His heir, Charles VIII, preferred Italian dynastic adventure to French national consolidation in Brittany. Charles's successor, Louis XII, displayed a similar priority. Francis continued the Italian effort, in part enabled by a strengthening of France. French common identity was facilitated by the French language.
    Spain differed from France. Aragon and Castile, united by marriage, despite opposition from Portugal, France, etc. Dynastic circumstances, Isabelle's marriage to Aragon's ruler, instead of a suggested match with Portugal's determined Spain. The joint campaign to conquer Grenada led further to North Africa. Ferdinand turned to Italy, acquiring Naples. While the Iberian territories were more dynastic than national, they empowered the common dynastic ruler. Scandinavian union proved too weak to persevere. Swedish national feeling triumphed over Danish rulers' perhaps inept handling of their opportuniy. So, in Western Europe, some centralization and larger bational sentiment grew, much did not.
iii. (90-99) Central and Eastern Europe: Under Ivan III, Moscow expanded. Hungary's Mathias Corvinus tried. The Jagellons succeeded briefly, the Hapsburgs longer, Ivan took Novgorod, exiled those there opposing him, acquired other lands and a sense of destiny, augmented by his marriage to Sophia Paleologus. She strengthened the Russian Orthodox Faith, court ceremonial (including the ruler's power and prestige) and Russia's identity as the Third Rome. Hungary's Mathias Corvinus failed to acquire Bohemia, but seized Vienna. He died without heirs in 1490, and the Jagellons succeeded. Casimir IV, ruling Lithuania and Poland, defeated the Teuton Knights, etc.:"Thus for a brief period most of the political units of eastern Europe--Poland, Lithuania, Pomerania, Bohemia, and Hungary--were united under the control of the Jagellon dynasty." pp. 95-96
    However, that was brief. Lasting dynastic strength was Hapsburg. Among marriage alliances, Spain, Bohemia, Hungary, etc. joined already significant holding, including the elected Emperor:

"At the beginning of the sixteenth century the effects of dynastic consolidation were visible in both national monarchies and supranational empires, but the strength of the former was already sufficient to establish the direction in which the European state system was to evolve." p. 99

IV  i. (100-108) Monarchies and Estates: With some exceptions (Swiss cantons, Hansa towns, some Italian and German cities), monarchs (hereditary in the West, largely elected in the East) ruled. A kingdom generally covered a complex collection of entities, each with its separate privileges. Emerging strong monarchs lessened nobles' power. In Spain crown and townsmen joined together against the aristocracy. Isabella ordered castles demolished. Spain's king became head of the three chivalric orders. Charles V added impressive ritual to the knight's life. Spain's monarch's also assumed impressive control over the clergy and the town assemblies.
    England's Henry VII founded the Tudor dynasty, had illegal castles demolished, tried lords' followers accused of public disorder and confiscated some nobles' land and finances. French nobles remained stronger longer. French kings did have greater control over revenue. They also directed knightly energy into the Italian wars. The German Emperor did have significant control over the imperial administration. Polish nobles retained such power that the country could not respond quickly and competently in time of danger. Strong royal governments were strengthened by their growing army and administration, though they appear weak in comparison to modern governments.
ii. (108-122) City States and Federal Leagues: Some Italian states (Naples, Papal, Savoy) had estates; others, varying from contemporary norm more resembled modern states. In Florence, citizenship was restricted; rural residents were excluded. This led to military reliance on foreign mercenaries, with a local militia used that lacked the training time to be effective. Even within Florence's walls, democratic appearance clouded actual aristocracy. Cosimo de Medici skillfully used the system to exercise personal control. His son and grandson succeeded. The grandson's aristocratic style and acceptance of France's 1494 invasion led to his exile and constitutional changes (enabling Savonarola and then Piero Soderini their periods in charge.), until the Medici restoration and the expulsion of the French in 1512. In 1527, Medici became Grand Duke.
    In Venice, busnessmen ruled as aristocrats. The Doge was a ceremonial figure; the Senate had real power, its ten man public saety committee significant. The people were kept happy, though those outside the city felt excluded. Young aristocrats were raised with a keen sense of business and public responsibility. Milan's republic fell to its mercenary Francesco Sforza, who became Duke. He and his son presided over a splendid court. Smaller Italian states followed Milan's individual ruler pattern. Italian states could ally militarily, but did not form leagues. Swiss confederation enabled them to resist greater power efforts to control them, and even to play a role in freeing Italy from the French in 1512. Each canton's veto and a lack of an effective executive impeded further integration. Meanwhile, the Hanseatic League declined with Bruges silting up, less collective focus and external Dutch and Danish competition. 
iii. (122-127) The Resources of Government: All states needed revemue, though some, e.g. Florence, Milan and Venice, less keenly. Some kingdoms, e.g. Poland, found this very challenging. Varied conditions led to various solutions. Feudal theory restricted kings to their personal property. They asked their estates for contributions. The sale of offices, business regulation, etc. helped. English enclosures benefited the king. Spain's monarchy taxed wool. England's Henry Vii left his successors a financial surplus. Emperor Maximilian was constantly in need. All western European monarchs faced the concept of individual property rights. 
iv. (127-138) Formal Political Theory: Theory responded to the emerging modern secular state and its ruler. Tradition, Classical and Christian, pointed to state supported justice, medievally identified with Christianity and with property rights. Political theory may be idealistic or realistic. Realists, especially lawyers, are particularily relevant. England's Sir John Fortescue noted the king's need for administrators and revenue. He upheld Parliament's right to authorize royal financing. France's Philippe Commines agreed on the need for royal financing and estates right to consent to it. Roman law supported strong government.
    Erasmus wrote a mirror for princes for the future Charles V. His and others' idealistic suggestions contrast with the realistic Machiavelli. He wrote in his enorced retirement from an active political and diplomatic life. He considered Classical Rome, Republic and Empire, for examples to inspire contemporary Florence and Italy. He assessed important: leaders' abikity, religion, a citizen army, more dependable than mercenaries. Rome's decline and fall he attributed to human imperfection, even a Christian view of man's evil nature. He defined good as action for the community. Unethical actions were used against Florence, so, practical, not moral, means  may secure Florence's advantage. He appealed to Italiam patriotism, yearning for a strong leader to free and favor Italy.
    England's Thomas More wrote an idealistic "Utopia". More opposed France's Italian wars and England's enclosure movement. He described an idealistic state: peaceful, ethical, spiritual, tolderant, etc. More, as Macchiavelli, saw great states exercise brute power. More, as Erasmus, admired Plato's and Aristotle's ideal city state. Utopia is a league of city states. More deplored the real world growth of great unitary states. 

V i. (139-145) The Balance of Power in  Italy, 1454-1494: Many see in late Fifteenth Century Italy the true start of modern international relations. Toynbee speaks of the balance of power politics here in this period. He sees pressure greater in the centre and steadily diminishing outward. By 1450 there were five great Italian powers: Naples, the Papal States, Florence, Milan, and Venice. The period began with the treaty (Lodi 1454) ending Milenese-Venetian War. Florence had switched from opposing to supporting Milan. Francesco Sforza secured rulership of Milan. Succession issues challenged equilibrium. Naples's Alphonso the Magnanimus's death in 1458 was first, the mid 1460s deaths of Sforza and Cosimo de Medici next. Pope Sixtus IV's(1471-1484) pressured Florence. Lorenzo de Medici escaped assassination on Easter 1478; his brother did not. Lorenzo went to Naples to appeal for peace. Turkish capture of Otranto augmented Italian preference for peace among Italian states. Further Papal plans were frustrated by an alliance of Florence, Milan and Naples. Milan turning against Naples enabled the 1494 French invasion. Italy's five great powers were not equal; Venice was great in a European sense. Italy was not a closed system. Several Italian courts had relations with outside states. Italy was constantly threatened by the Ottomans, the French and the Spanish.
ii. (145-149) The Practice of Diplomacy: By 1500, Italian city states had permanent representatives abroad. Venice only allowed its well trained diplomats a maximum of three years at a post, to avoid too close a personal . connection. Regular reports were supplemented with information from secret agents. Codes and ciphers were used. Detailed information was obtained and used in political decision making.
iii. (149=156) The Invasion of Italy: Charles VIII, poorly aware of the Italian situation, aspired to take Naples on the way to regaining Constantinople for Christendom. He had influential advisers advocating invasion for personal gain. The invasion was also an outlet for the energies of French knights. Ludovico Sforza, feeling threatened in Milan, appealed to France. He was surprised by the French occupation of Milan and his imprisonment. Wealthy Italian exiles loaned money to the French King, hoping his success would transform things in their favour. Analyses drawing on Nineteenth Century nationalism are anachronistic. Comments concerning Charles VIII's service in spreading the Italian Renaissance north are also inaccurate. Invasion was not necessary for that cultural diffusion which had already begun. Thomas More's character Hythlodaye suggests that the French king would do better to focus his attention on France.
iv. (156-160) The European State System, 1494-1515: Charles VIII had been assured that he'd have little opposition. He swept to Naples and quickly withdrew in face of great opposition. He died. Louis XII took Milan and part of Naples. Spanish troops drove the French from Naples. In 1508 the Leaugue of Cambrai formed against Venice.  A few years later, a Holy League formed to force the French from Italy. France's brilliant Gaston de Foix prevented this before his death in his victorious Battle of Ravenna in 1512. France was forced out. Louis XII died. His successor, ambitious Francis I, swiftly entered Italy, defeated opponents and took Milan. The March 1517 Treaty of Cambrai providerd for French domination of northern Italy, the Papacy of central and the Spanish of southern. Apparent peace was short lived. The imperial election and the Hapsburgs rise brought renewed strife.

VI i. (161-165) The Renaissance Papacy: Nicholas V and Pius II, humanists and patrons, administered responsibly without major scandals. Sixtus IV (1471-1484), engaging in political and military strife, striving to provide lands for his nephews, presided over a luxurious court. Innocent VIII openly acknowledged and provided for his children. Alexander VI (1492-1503) was infamous, his reign a low point. Pius III's four weeks were followed by the renouned Julius II, patron of artists, including Raphael and Michelangelo. He helped drive the French from Italy. He was satirized for his remoteness from the Petrine ideal. The humanist Leo X, admirer of books, manuscripts, Classical comedy, masques and hunting parties, succeeded. He neglected administration and failed to offer needed reform. Historians criticize Vatican failings unknown to most contemporaries, though, alas, widespread through Christendom.
ii. (165-176) Symptoms of Failure: Plurality of benefices, preoccupation with secular matters, including high state service, etc. weakened dioceses. Many parishes lacked priests or had poorly educated ones. Some monastic reform occurred, though not extensive enough. Rising monarchies intensified Church decentrilization. In England, there is the example of the Richard Hunne case, with its aspects of royal and ecclesiastical courts, etc. England's primacy of Canterbury was lacking in France, which had fourteen archbishops. There was significant disorganization within French dioceses. Leo X and Francis I in the Concordat of Bologna in 1516 strengthened royal control. Spanish monarchs also had control, including over the Inquisition. Spain had abuses and effective means to overcome them. Italy was not a single state. Prominent families controlled ecclesiastical offices, including the Papacy. The three German ecclesiastical electors (Cologne, Mainz and Trier) were wealthy and powerful princes. There were other German clerics who were territorial princes. In contrast, there were many poor priests. Germany lacked an effective central monarch. A fee to Rome could provide exemption re plurality of offices. Leo X called for indulgences to be sold for building St Peters. Some of this in Mainz would go to covering Albert of Hohenzollern's debt re appointment as Archbishop of Mainz. A veteran indulgence preacher began selling this in early 1517. A few months later, Luther posted his objections. The abuses may not have been worse than in previous times. They were a negative side. There was also a positive.
iii. (176-181) The Conditions of Reform: Savonarola: Many saw ecumenical councils as necessary to reform abuse. Julius II responded to council advocates, including those meeting at Pisa, by summoning the Fifth Lateran Council. Rational considerations for reform were complemented by a more mystical yearning. Savonarola, a Dominican monk, became an impressive preacher, influential politically in Florence, following the exile of the Medici. He urged the French king, Charles VIII, to include all Italy in Florence's reforms. These included a council based on Venice's constitution. Saonarola also appealed to the Pope. Alexander VI's political, etc. position eventually led him to excommunicate Savonarola. Savonarola ruled Florence for a remarkably long (for a preacher) four years, then was arrested, tortured, tried and burned. He had focused negatively on abuses. Others were more positive.

VII i. (182-186) Manuscripts and Libraries: More Classical Latin manuscripts were retrieved before 1453, though some significant finds, such as Tacitus, occurred after that. Many Greek manuscripts were in western Europe before Constantinople's fall. Many others were keenly sought afterwards. There was great interest in the Classics. The Fifteenth Century was an age of libraries, including the Vatican's, Bessarion's (bequeathed to Venice), the Medici's, Pico della Mirandola's, French King Francis I's and Hungarian King Matthias's. Libraries contained Greek manuscripts and even some in Hebrew. Along with Classical texts were many Christian ones.
ii. (186-190) The Development of Printing: Scholars keenly debate the origin of printing, highly transformative for intellectual activity. A large secular readership propelled it to spread rapidly. By 1500 (only half a century after Gutenburg had made his metal modification to the wood blocks originally used in China and transmitted by the Arabs to Europe) there were many printing presses, including at least 73 in Italy alone. Aldus Manutius in Venice founded the Aldine Press, publisher of Greek and Classical works.
iii. (190-194) The Greek Revival: Pope Nicholas V saw to the translation of many Greek Classics, including Aristotle, Thucydides, Polybius and Plato's Laws. Plato exerted the greatest influence. Cosimo de Medici supported  Marsilio Ficino in establishing a Platonic Academy in Florence and translating Plato. The Academy was a gathering of Plato admirers, not a college classroom institution. It held symposia, and occasionally Ficino addressed large audiences. He also wrote commentaries and his own philosophy: "In his general optimism, in his emphasis upon the freedom of the will and the possible glory of man, and in the development of a theory of love Ficino has been regarded as the formulator of a Renaissance philosophy." p.193 
iv. (194-199) The Hebrew Revival: Medieval Christians were unaware of the Hebrew literature in the Jewish communities in their midst. Interest arose as this volume's period approached. Preeminent among Hebraists of this period is Pico della Mirandola. He studied widely (including Padua, Bologna, Paris), wrote impressively, was a member of Florence's Platonic Academy, drew on the Jewish Cabala, Arabic textx, Hermetic writings, etc. He died when he was 32. His most famous pupil, Johann Reuchlin, published a Hebrew grammar, studied Jewish literature and tried to prevent the burning of Hebrew texts.
v, (199-201) Biblical Scholarship: Lorenzo Valla's mid Fifteenth Century application of philology to the Bible influenced Erasmus, who published Valla's Biblical work in 1505, and viewed his own as a continuation of it. Spain's Cardinal Ximenes founded the University of Alcala and published a multilingual edition of the Bible in columns. Ximenes published his work in 1514, Erasmus his Novum Instrumentum in 1516.
vi (201-203) The Sense of History: Anachronistic depictions continued of ancients in current garb. Chronicles continued to be written. There were also personal accounts, e.g. Commines. And Italian humanism now studied history as a separate field, able to complement the miraculous with calm human reason, with the feeling that piety and learning could be restored.   

VIII i. (204-207) The Basic Assumptions:There were two main kinds of reformers: the mystic (focusing more on grace and example) and the rationalist (more into an active and ethical life). Humanists remained within the ubiquitous Christian paradigm. It is incorrect to describe them as reviving ancient paganism or modern agnosticism. They felt there was no inherent contradiction between Classical and Christian thought. Their distinguishing feature was thinking educational reform could succeed in transforming society. As the first generation, they lacked the bitter experience of disappointment.
ii. (207-211) Reform and the New Learning in Spain: Spain, during the time of Ferdinand and Isabella, had the earliest successful reform. This was largely due to Isabella's confessor, Ximenes. He had served in Rome, withdrawn from the world, attained high ecclesiastical rank, including Cardinal, from which he sought, with some success, to spiritualize Spanish monasteries and bishoprics. He founded Alcala University to provide future bishops. It also was a significant centre for Biblical study. Another means he used to guide Spanish spirituality was as head of the Inquisition. He had a similar pious and mystical nature as Savonarola, a similar wish for spiritual reform, though his career and destiny differed. Ximenes, with royal support, used the new learning for traditional Christianity.   
iii. (211-215) England: Sir Thomas More and His Friends: England, lacking an Alcala University, had more widespread educational reforms at the secondary level and at Oxford and Cambridge. This aroused great scholastic opposition. John  Colet's Florentine visit inspired his interest in Plato and Biblical study. He founded St. Paul's. Those interested in the new learning included the Archbishop of Canterbury and Sir Thomas More. More served in Cardinal Morton's home, studied law, hosted Erasmus, wrote Utopia and defended the new learning. He held that it agreed with Christianity.
iv. (215-219) Le Fevre d'Etaples: France had Bude and LeFevre d'Etaples. The latter journeyed to Italy and was influenced by Florence's Platonic Academy. D'Etaples studied Aristotle and Plato. He focused on Christianity, studied the Psalms, published the influential Nicholas of Cusa, blended humanist rationalism  with pious mysticism, and, while anticipating some Protestant thought, clung firmly to the Roman Church.
v. (219-223) German Humanism: Germany was more national and anti Roman than other countries. Scholasticism was strong in Germany and struggled fiercely with humanists from Italy. Johann Wassel and his famous pupil Rudolph Agricola helped establish German humanism, which had poetic circles, including that around the Neoplatonist Mutanus Rufus. Ulrich von Hutton was an education advocate. He strongly suppoted the Emperor and favoured a strong German state. He much opposed the flow of money from Germany to Rome. Hutton, seeing Luthor in agreement with these positions, supported him, diverting a generation of humanist reform advance.
vi. (223-228) Erasmus: Erasmus was highly esteemed and influential in his lifetime. He was born c. 1466, bacame a priest in 1492, went to Paris in 1494, travelled, corresponded voluminously, wrote Adages, essays, Praise of Folly, Colloquies, etc. He published a scholarly edition of the New Testament. He published Latin Fathers, beginning with St. Jerome, then Greek Fathers. He was tolerant, peaceful and firmly committed to Rome and the unity of Christianity.

IX i. (229-234) The Artist and the Patron: Our period is a key artistic one, one of Voltaire's four special ones. Among factors creating such may be: balance between order and chaos, and between orthodoxy and irreligion. Patronage was significant. Artists had been medieval craftsmen. Now, rulers and wealthy merchants competed to attract leading artists. Businessmen sought to give something back to the community, rulers to enhance the standing of their city. The Medici (Cosimo and Lorenzo in Florence, Leo X in Rome) were the most renowned patrons. Previous popes had shown Renaissance interests: Nicholas V and Sixtus IV signoficantly contributing to the Vatican library, Sixtus IV and Alexander VI building, and Julius II supporting Raphael, Michelangelo, etc. While the popes and Medici were the greatest Renaissance patrons of the arts, courts of cities large and small, sought the glamour of and vitality of artistic circles and their creations. Marriages and trips to Italy brought Italian influences to northern Europe: palaces, libraries, manuscript collections, humanist histories, artistic and literary circles--all in the Italian style. Some cardinals were keen humanists and patrons. Most monarchs of our period were themselves less interested, though Francis I did bring Lorenzo da Vinci to France in 1516, where Lorenzo stayed until his death in 1519.
ii. (234-245) The Classic Tradition in Italy: This period, as medieval times, felt Classical and Christian traditions were harmonious. Recovery of Classical works (e.g. the Laocoon finding immortalized in Sadoleto's admired ode) provided a more accurate awareness of antiquity, inspiring the period's artists, who, while painting Classical deities, did so in Christian themes. Neoplatonism did modify Christian depiction, for example, in the concept of the round church with the altar in the middle, included for St. Peter's in Rome, Christendom's central church. Michelangelo's paintings on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, completed in 1512, are another example:
"It can be argued that these scenes are intended to reflect--and texts can be found which confirm this interpretation--the ascent of the soul in the hierarchy of being as it was outlined by Ficino and Pico." p. 241
Raphael's Camera della Segnatura, completed in 1511, representing the saints in heaven across from the wall depicting Classical thinkers gathered around Aristotle and Plato can be seen as the harmony of faith and reason. Our period's poets, in Latin and in Italian, combined Classical and Christian. Renaissance courts enjoyed tales of medieval chivalry, such as Luigi Pulchi's, finished in 1483, and Ariosto's begun in 1503, published in 1516, though continued until Ariosta died in 1533. In Classic epic form, Ariosto recounts the founding and heroic deeds of the Este family. Also, our period provides examples of writers and artists using Classical inspiration innovatively.
iii. (245-252) Gothic and Renaissance in Northern Europe: Durer: By 1500, Italian influences adorned most northern capitals, from Moscow to London, with architecture and literary circles. Vernacular literatures, however, continued their medieval inspiration, though unimpressively. The vital humanist impulse of Rabelais, Shakespeare, Cervantes, etc., comes later. Serene medieval Flemish art is offset by Hieronymus Bosch's symbolic and perplexing paintings. While Italian Neoplatonism looked to God the Father, Germany felt more the passion of Christ. An artistic example is Mathias Grunewald's Eisenheim altarpiece, nine painted panel's completed in 1516 in the diocese of Mainz.
    Albrecht Durer, born in 1471, bridged German and Italian styles. He studied painting in Germany and travelled to Italy in 1494. There he became interested in the thory of art and the complementry nature of theory and practice. He returned to Italy in 1505. He was famous in Germany and friend to northern humanists, including Erasmus and the Emperor Maximilian, for whom he worked on woodcuts of the Imperial Triumphal Arch. He wrote two major works on art theory, with a practical interest in anatomy and inanimate objects' structure to enable their optimum representation in two dimensional painting.
iv. (252-259) Toward the Scientific Revolution: Leonardo: Science, along with capitalism and nationalism, marks modern times. The Scientific Revolution occurred from c. 1550 to 1700. Its roots in our period bear investigation. Three key factors are: scholasticism, humanism, and, from the crafts, emperical experience. The blending of these may be considered in the life of the age's most noted thinker. Padua, renowned medical centre, heavily influenced by Aristotle and his Arab commentator Averroes, contributed significantly to the development of a scientific method, also benefitting from humanism's attentive linguistic analysis of the Classics. The practical preparation of accurate maps for the period's increased navigation exempliies the empirical contribution.
"The harmonious contribution of theory and practice in creative activity was one of the themes of Renaissance speculation and it is perhaps not surprising that the greatest advances were made in astronomy, geography and physics, all sciences which were closely related to the most intensive practical efforts which the European world was then making." p. 256
While Leonardo da Vinci had little formal education, he was acquainted with, and attended lectures by, renowned thinkers. His notebooks, clearly intended only for personal use, testify to the wide scope of his interests and focus on actual experience, although the notebooks also record uncriticized, erroneous Classical medical and scientific opinions. His range of interests offers him as a prime example of the Renaissance man.

(260=270) Conclusion: Erasmus at the end of this period, 1516, 1517, wrote of his anticipation of glorious times ahead, a sharp contrast to the gloomy expectations of Aeneas Sylvius at the period's beginning. Realistically, warfare rather than peace seemed more likely. Evident seemed increasing strain between rising royalty and individual property, especially of the wealthy. This period witnessed serious attention to accommodating the rediscovered Classical civilization within traditional Christianity.
"The most distinctive characteristic of the period was an effort to assimilate a wider knowledge of classical antiquity and fit it to the categories of Christian dogma." p. 264

Knowledge in this period began to be segmented, science and art separated. Religion seemed less significant, increasing secularism more likely. Fracastoro noted both the emergence of a new disease, syphilis, along with continuing conflict and the thrilling discovery of new lands, some even below new stars. Lefevre d'Etaples hoped that the increasing study of the Bible would see it preached effectively in the new lands. Yet, modern Western civilization focuses more on the secular betterment of the world, an attitude coming from the Enlightenment. And the Enlightenment looked back to the Renaissance. In conclusion, the period ended with awareness of the destruction looming and hope it would not materialize, but rather the potential golden age.
