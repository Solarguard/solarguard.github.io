Here is an initial attempt at a family tree chart for the Jia
family. This family when the story begins is composed of two main
branches, each living in its own mansion, side by side with each
other. There are in addition other members of the clan throughout
the land, perhaps the one most important to the story Jia Yu-cun.
See the character list for more on them, when that is available
here. This present chart begins with the branch to which the more
central characters belong and then shows the relationships of those
in the neighbouring mansion. The information is presented so that
the curved bracket indicates descent (that is reading across is
reading down the generations and reading down the computer screen is
reading along the same generation). I've amended my chart, removing
information provided as the story proceeds. Here then is the
situation as the novel begins.

A. Rong-guo Branch. Grandmother, still living, had two sons and one
daughter (Jia Min):

III. Jia Min

B. Ning-guo Branch.

                        Qin-shi

                    )2. Xi-chun

In the future it is hoped a more complete chart, including data
provided as part of the developing story, will also be available
here (with the appropriate notice that it contains spoilers) and
info on the characters whose relationship is to the family through
maternal lines. Also, a relatively complete character list with
names as used in both the Penguin and Foreign Languages Press
translations is in process of preparation.
