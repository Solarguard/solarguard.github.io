Concerning Patron Quest and Ritual

This is a replacement for the file written in the late summer of
2000 CE.

I recall stating that I had not undertaken a specific ritual and
quest for a patron deity since joining ADF as I had already been in
contact with the two patron deities, Epona and Oghma. Oghma as the
god of wisdom, among other characteristics, is especially close to
me in matters dealing with the intellect and with the intuitive
ogham. Since 2000 CE I have been even more deeply involved with the
study of Ogham and divination. This house has the name Oghma in
ogham letters written in what is perceived as the central place in
the household, above the entrance between the living room and the
dining room. Most personal and family rituals performed in the house
have been performed at this entrance. On the tops of the two book
cases left and right of the entrance are kept the genealogical
records of this family. Oghma is visualized as strong, grey of hair
and beard and with wise eyes.

Epona is the goddess of protection, often visualized as riding on a
white horse. We have an annual family celebration on her festival
and on one of these we placed an inscription written in ogham
letters in Irish reading, "Epona takes care of this household," in
Irish. Her I always invoke each time I set out from this house and
thank on my arrival. Her I invoke when guests depart asking that she
watch them safely home. One of the most common manifestations of the
spirit world, as I perceive it, in my life is the frequent interest
of crows in me. Since there is a connection of the raven/crow to
Epona in the literature, I have always addressed these crows as
messengers of Epona. Very often, wherever I am, especially if there
is need on my part, I visualize Epona on her white horse and state
the need. I also thank her if I notice things have been going well.
The original file may have dwelt more on the family festival of this
goddess: the eating of different forms of apple, the riddles, the
gift giving, the games.
