v. 24 "The Empire in Transition," transl. David Stephan Powers, 
SUNY, Albany, 1989

Translator's Foreward (pp. xiii-xvii): Here's a vivid account of 
the decade following al-Walid's attainment of Umayyad apogee. Three
caliphs (fondly remembered, luxurious Sulayman, pious Umar and
profligate Yazid) met tribal factionalism, centrifugal tendencies,
changing administrative circumstances, religious opposition and the
issue of non Arab converts and taxation. Acknowledgements are made.

Saturday, February 23, 715. Sulayman appointed Yazid governor of
Iraq and Salih ibn Abd ar Rahman treasurer with orders to capture,
torture and execute the family of al Hajjaj. Al-Hajjaj and Qutaybah

pilgrimage.

A.H. 99 (14/8/717-2/8/718): Sulayman died on October 7, 717. 
The quote following serves as a fitting epitaph: "A slave girl
belonging to Sulayman looked at him one day, and he asked, "How
do you like what you see?" She recited:

"You are the best object of delight -- if only you would last."
But man does not possess immortality.

I do not know of any blemish in you/ that other people have,
except that you will pass away."

Concerned that his sons were too young to rule effectively, he
appointed Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz to succeed him. Yazid ibn Abd al
Malik would succeed Umar. Umar ordered the troops back from
Byzantium.  He sent ibn Hatim ibn al Numan to repel invading

passed away.
