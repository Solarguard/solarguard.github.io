Selected Letters, Aretino, transl. George Bull, Penguin, Harmondsworth,
1976

The translator introduces (pp. 13-48) Late Renaissance Italy: divided,
invaded by rival outside powers, its society fiercely competitive and
very violent, its artists contending for patronage. Aretino, born in
Arezzo in 1492, Passing through Perugia, Siena, Rome and Mantua, in
1527 settled securely in Venice. There he wrote, enjoyed high society,
corresponnded with the mighty and achieved the influence of an
outstanding journalist. Shortly after his death, the Index placed his
works on the Index of forbidden books. Among these were some three
thousand letters, ninety five of which are included in this modern
