Triadic Tribute

Being a Reminiscence of three of the most glorious fruits upon the
tree of Irish Poetry

(Invocation)

Begins hesitantly this tribute to three brilliant manifestations of
the Irish poetic ideal. Starting on this voyage of gratitude to these
ancestral voices closest in time we find first the verses of Egan
O'Rahilly, continue to those of... and close with the morning glory of
the poems attributed to Suibhne Geilt.

A Egan O'Rahilly

Can I begin to pen your praise?
Can I commence to extol you?
Can I describe the life you knew?
Can I lament your trying days?

Ablaze you were, Westering Sun.
A jewel you were, a fruitful find.
A fire you were, the Irish mind.
A harvest fair when summer's done.

As the very learned bard provides the example of responding to a
satirical attack (See "The Satire of Domnall na Tuile, #38 of the
Irish Text's Society O'Rahilly volume), let's first quote something
funny and may the rest of this section demonstrate the distance the
one quoted resides from any accurate understanding of the poet, just
like that bookseller telling O'Rahilly that he could have a valuable
volume for free, if only he could show to all present he could read.

   Aodhga/n O'Rahilly (1672-1726), the Munster poet, is sometimes
   regarded as the greatest of all the Gaelic poets. It is true that
   his conception is poetic, but his style and form are too involved
   for pleasant reading. His overuse of adjectives is pathetically
   bad. Yet some of his verse is not without merit.

   Peter Kavanagh, ENCYCLOPEDIA AMERICANA vol. 12 p. 221

O'Rahilly inhabited a land invaded, a time his society and culture
were under fierce attack. This was the era of the entrenchment of the
English Protestant Ascendency. It was the frigid winter of the former
Irish way of life. Nobles were now deprived and in exile. There were
plots to colonize O'Rahilly's native Kerry. Bards, previously much
rewarded, are now reduced to being grateful for the gift of a pair of
shoes.

The heart of the body of O'Rahilly's poetry is his elegies, his
laments, his keening the dead. There are a dozen or so of these very
anguished tributes to those whose lives during Ireland's long sorrow
had reached their end. He mourns the McCarthy chiefly clan, Browns
(also granted a tribute poem on the wedding of Valintine Brown and
Honora Butler, 30) and the drowning of three children, 12.

There exists also his marking the passing of the likes of
Muirchcartach O'Griffin:

Daorifreann thall n-a gheall is chuige tharlaidh,
Is se/ troighthe go gann de theampull Chille hA/irne.

As reward he has got hell of the damned in the world beyond, he has
   got these,
With six scarce feet of the killarney graveyard.

His normal grief is perhaps best illustrated by the long lament at the
passing of the O'Callaghan in 1724. This mentions the deprived (friars,
clergy and bards), lists the mounds and the waters groaning, illumines
the deceased's formerly lively activity and the hospitality of his
noble home "Eich da/ mbronnadh aca ar ollamhnaib Fodla Steeds being
bestowed on the ollamhs of Fodla" l. 89), the sad depredations of the
foreighners, the gifts presented to O'Callaghan at his birth by Roman
deities and the remarkable declamation of the O'Callaghan family tree,
generation by generation, all the way to the first man.

   Ni'l glu/n le ra/dh o/ A/dhamh go Domnall,
   Acht a/rd-ri/ghthe bhi/ ar an do/mhan,
   Ri/ghthe cri/che is ri/gthe co/igeach
   Fialtaoirigh tighearnaidhe agus leogain.

   There is no link to record from Adam to Domhnall
   But high kings, who ruled the world,
   Kings of countries, kings of provinces,
   Generous chieftains, lords and heroes. pp. 90-91

In addition to laments of those passing away from Ireland's misery,
O'rahilly mourned the state of that misery. The very first poem is
titled "The Wounds of the Land of Fodla" and the second is "The Ruin
that Befell the Great Families of Erin (pp. 6-11). It begins with the
poignant reprtition of the words "Tir" ("Land") and "gan" ("without").
It later lists noble families (O'Niall, O'Doherty, O'Moore, O'Flaherty,
O'Brien, O'Rourke, O'Donnell, etc.) now diminished and deprived and
closes with the bard anguished and lacking a pair of shoes.

The poems contain many examples of O'Rahilly's facility with the
legends of Ireland, glimpses of the sad lot of his day, as well as
with the pattern of life in the aristocratic tradition.A noble's
hospitality, his support of music and the Catholic religion is often a
part of of his dirge. There are some verses to Donogh O'Hickey which
include a reference to that clan's traditional role as healers. There
is also his humourous treatment of the theft of a priest's rooster.

Heart rending may be his prophetic response to the ills of the age he
inhabited, especially #25, his so yearningly precise prediction of a
great Irish victory to take place on October 3, 1711:

   As soin suas go deireadh an domhain
   Ni/ bheidh Gaill i gceannus i nE/irinn.

   Thenceforward untill the end of the world
   There will be no foreigners in power in Ireland. pp. 144-145

A traditional poet such as O'Rahilly was also an accomplished satirist
and some samples of his satires survive, including his retort to
Domnal na Tuile. And he could receive two pence from an Englishman
ignorant of Irish whose son was dangling in a tree for:

   Is math do thoradh a chrainn,
   Rath do thoradh ar gach aon chraoibh,
   Mo chreach! gan crainn Inre Fa/ill
   La/n det thoradh gach aon la/.

   Good is thy fruit, O tree,
   May every branch bear such good fruit.
   Alas! that the trees of Innisfail
   Are not full of thy fruit every day. pp. 264-265

The introduction of the Irish Texts Society O'Rahilly volume contains
(pp. xxxviii-li) an examination of the poet's metres. Briefly this
divides the poems into lyrics with five stressed vowels in a line and
elegies of four stressed vowels to a line. Poems could also have a
binding, a final stanza summing them up, with a different metre, say
six stressed vowels to a line. There would appropriately be a
correspondence of the stressed vowel sounds in similar lines,
especially the final stressed vowel and the syllable(s) it dominates.

A Closing Tribute to Egan O'Rahilly:

A glow upon the western heights,
A warmth as come the colder nights,
A harp honouring former lords,
A voice releasing Ireland's swords,
A goose the hunters failed to slay,
A goose that would not fly away,
A treasure vast, an ancient mind,
A sage that gazed ahead, behind,
A thrilling tune as sets the sun,
A mountain gleam as day is done,
A blazing leaf as summer flees,
A lofty crown in tallest trees,
A bard after the age of song,
A name to prize forever long.
