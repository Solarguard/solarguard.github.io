<h2>China</h2>

<p>China presents the most impressive civilization in human history. This site contains five subdirectories and five links, Michael McKenny's synopses and reviews of some thirteen original works, including synopses of THE SCHOLARS, the 70 chapter SHUI HU (called ALL MEN ARE BROTHERS in Pearl S. Buck's English translation), the 120 chapter SAN KUO in C.H. Brewitt-Taylor's literary translation, the five volumes of the Penguin translation of Hong Lou Meng, an incomplete poetic response to Chuang Tzu, reviews of two poetry anthologies and synopses and reviews to eleven highly significant secondary works. For the past several years, Autumn has been a time for enjoying some great Chinese work and adding reviews here. Journey to the West (Monkey) was the one great novel left. Last updated on December 15, 2006 C.E. this section now includes a brief summary of the one hundred chapters of the Foreign Languages Press English translation of Journey to the West and a brief summary of Sally Hovey Wriggins' book about the historical Xuanzang, both read during the Autumn of 2006.<p>
