This beginning of a sixth at Tabari file must reiterate comments that
appeared in earlier Solarguard at Tabari files. The history of this
great scholar is very impressive in its recording of the chains of
transmission of information as well as in its awesome length. This
file now contains a brief precis of volumes 21, 22 and the first
half of 23 of the English translation. Volume 21 has some 260 plus
xviii pages, 234 of text, including footnotes. Anyone able to read
the work itself is encouraged to do so. This summary is intended to 
provide something for those unable to take advantage of so splendid
an opportunity for a first hand exposure to this key primary source.

small number of troops. Initially successful, he was killed.
Shabib, Salih's successor, was very pressed, but he prevailed

was disastrous and the new commander, Sa'id ibn Mujalid, killed.

to travel on guard an unexpectd way. They did so. Shabib led a
thousand men against Attab's fifty thousand. Shabib prevailed.

Shabib entered Kufa. Al Hajjaj led the Syrian troops against 
him. These remained firm and thrust Shabib back. Al Hajjaj gave
safe conduct to defecters and Shabib's force shrank. Shabib 
withdrew, recuperated for a few months and then again advanced.
Sufyan ibn al Abrad met him. There was heavy fighting until 
nightfall. Shabib broke off the battle and drowned when his
horse tossed him into the water.

in revolt. He led a force to Qum and Kashan. His borther Hamzah
governor of Hamadhan secretly provisioned him. He was joined by

and killed in fierce fighting.

combat. Kharijites fell out with each other. Fierce factional
fighting weakened them. Al Muhallab attacked and defeated the
strongest of them. Bukayr was killed as a rebel.

Rahman ibn al Ashath, whom he intensely disliked, against 
Zunbil. Abd ar Rahman occupied some of Zunbil's territory,
