<center>THE LOST BELIEFS OF NORTHERN EUROPE</center><p>

Hilda Ellis Davidson, Routledge, 1993.<p>

This is a fascinating treatment of the religion of the Paleopagan
Celts and Germans.<p>

Before proceeding to the author's examination of the main topics
treated in the book (her first chapter, for example, takes a look at
several important archaeological finds) here's a glimpse at the last
chapter, her valuable survey of leading trends and figures in the
scholarship of mythology.<p>

She begins by mentioning Saxo Grammaticus and Snorri Sturluson.<p>

<blockquote>Snorri
viewed the pre-Christian religion as a groping attempt to discover the
truth about the divine world, and felt able to consider the beliefs of his
fore-fathers objectively and without condemnation. (pp. 144-145)</blockquote>

<p>One 
concept known to Saxo Grammaticus was that the gods were originally human
beings whose outstanding achievements had caused storytellers to portray them
as divine.<p>

<p>Next Davidson mentions the brothers Grimm and their presentation of
German folk-tales as myth, rather than entertainment. Kristensen in 19th
Century Denmark recorded attentively popular tales and songs, despite
scholarly disapproval.

<p>One of the major strands of that century was the debate between Max
Muller and Andrew Lang. 

<blockquote>As well as seeing an Indo-European origin for
many myths, Muller believed that his new approach helped to explain much 
that was puzzling in the mythological literature, due to earlier attempte to
interpret poetic symbols literally. The solar basis of our myths, he
argued, had left an indelible mark on our legends and traditional
language. (p. 147)</blockquote> 

<blockquote>He, [Lang] was much influenced by the work of E. P.
Taylor and the evolutionists, and in this differed from Muller, who had a
higher respect for the mentality of the so-called primitive savage than
had the early anthropologists. (pp. 147-148)</blockquote>

<p>Following Muller's death in 1900, others developed his solar theory.
For example, Thomas O'Rahilly saw the one eyed Balor as a symbol of the sun.
Sir John Rhys, however, saw Lugh and Cu Chulann as symbols of the sun. 

<blockquote>One
of the fascinations but also the weaknesses of solar mythology was the
number of possibilities available when choosing characters and objects to
identify with the sun. (p. 148)</blockquote>

<p>One major figure at the end of the 19th Century was James Frazer.
His THE GOLDEN BOUGH first appeared in 1890. Davidson mentions Frazer's
focus on the sacrificial king, on totemism and his view that, "Myths were
essentially early and misguided attempts to give a scientific explanation
of the world." (p. 149) Scholars applied Frazer's approach to their studies 
of religions in the Near East and in Greece.

<p>Among cautions underlined by H.E. Davidson is the danger of, "Assuming
that one set of rules only must be accepted, and that religious development
must have followed a single path," and, "The habit of ignoring previous
theories, assuming that all was chaos until at length the new thinker saw
the light." (p. 151)

<p>Another influential scholar was Mircea Eliade who viewed myths as
accounts of origins: of the world, of a ritual, of a custom, etc. Eliade
drew on Carl Jung's work on symbols.

<p>Claude Levi-Strauss approached myth as language, considered mythic
polarity (light vs dark) and, "Insisted that so-called primitives were
in no way inferior in their thought processes to modern men and women." 
(p. 153)

<p>Davidson comes next to Dumezil with his concept of Indo-European
tripartite function. She states that however neatly this may seem to
descibe Hindu or Graeco-Roman pantheons, it fails when applied to the
Celts and the Germans. 

<blockquote>The work of Sjoestedt has clearly demonstrated
that the Celts regarded their deities as many-skilled, so that it is
hardly possible to divide them satisfactorily according to their
separate functions, as can be done with the gods of ancient Rome...She felt
that it was not possible to assume that there had once been a clearly 
defined Common Celtic religion, with easily recognizable gods and goddesses,
declaring that, 'What we know of the decentralized character of society 
among the Celts, and of the local and anarchical character of their
mythology and ritual excludes that hypothesis.'  (p. 154)</blockquote>

<p>Davidson
feels that a similar point has been made by de Vries' ALTGERMANISCHE
RELIGIONGESCHICHTE (1957-1958)

<p>There is the amplification of this tripartite model, by Lyle, for
example, to include a fourth part -- that of the goddessses of the land,
that of autumn, etc. And there is the vast consideration by Gimbutas of
the Goddess of pre-historic Europe.

<p>Next mentioned is Hector Munro Chadwick whose THE HEROIC AGE
portrayed the similarity of Homeric and Germanic heroic poetry, 
understandable despite distances of time and geography because similar was,
"The way of life and the ideals of men grouped in small warrior-bands under
aristocratic leaders." (p. 156)

<p>Hector Chadwick and his wife Nora made a notable contribution to the
field, all the more valuable because they considered the evidence with
critical open minds. This includes a consideration of possible outside
influence on Celtic and Germanic mythology from outside sources: Roman,
Byzantine, Christian, Finno-Ugric, etc.

<p>The chapter concludes: 

<blockquote>Many new ways of approach have been explored
and fought over in the past, and there is every hope of fresh
understanding of the divine world of our ancestors emerging from
continued investigation of the written sources together with careful study 
of pictures, symbols and archaeological finds. There is much left to
discover. (p. 159)</blockquote>

<p>The first chapter of this book is called "Help from Archaeology".
Here the author considers several finds of particular interest: a grave in
France, a ship and a hill in England, a wagon in Austria, a bowl in Jutland
and memorial stones on a Baltic island.

<p>In a wagon, once covered by a mound 42 meters in diameter at the
base, sat a women about 35 years old. 

<blockquote>A magnificent diadem of gold was still
in place on her head, ending in two huge knobs of gold, with little winged
horses at the points where they were joined to the curved headpiece. She
wore brooches and necklaces, as well as bracelets on her wrists and
ankles, while a large bronze torc lay upon her body. (p. 15)</blockquote>

<p>There were
various vessels in the chamber, including a quite striking crater, 1.64 
meters tall, weighing 440 kilos with a capacity for 1,200 litres. 

<blockquote>On each
side of the handle was the familiar gorgon head usually found on craters,
but in this case executed with unusual power and restraint. Round the neck
was a frieze of warriors, some marching and others driving in four-horse
chariots. On the lid was the figure of a woman resembling a seeress,
wearing a veil over her head and shoulders and with one arm outstretched.
(p. 14)</blockquote>

<p>The ship, covered with a mound, was about 28 m long. It held,

<blockquote>weapons, shield, helmet and mailcoat...a purse with an elaborate jewelled
cover holding Merovingian gold coins...a stone whetstone with a set of 
carved faces and a bronze stag at the top...rich jewelled shoulder-clasps...
a huge gold buckle with intricate lacing patterns...small belt fittings,
strap-ends and scabbard mounts...a set of delicate gold fittings...A
small lyre...a set of playing pieces with a board...burnt remains...in a 
great silver dish...a set of silver bowls with equal-armed crosses...a 
number of bowls, cups, dishes and drinking horns, including two huge
aurochs horns set with silver...three large cauldrons, one with a chain of
elaborate workmanship...three buckets and a tub.</blockquote>

<p>Decorations included:
"Warriors and battle scenes on the plates on the helmet, the eagle and
dragon on the great shield...boars on the shoulder-clasps," and, "the trout
in the centre of one of the hanging bowls." (p.17-20)

<p>The hill contained post holes, including for a hall 11 by 5.5 meters, a
huge pile of ox-bones and a heap of ox-skulls.

<p>The little wagon is, 

<blockquote>A bronze platform on wheels, 240 mm (nearly 14
inches) [sic] in length, with a number of standing figures on it...In
the centre, towering over the others, is a female figure with earings,
wearing a belt; she carries a shallow bowl on her head, supported by a small
protective pad...Before and behind this female figure there is a pair of
mounted warriors, facing away from her, and between the pair of horsemen
stand a woman and an ithyphallic man brandishing an axe. At the front of
each group is a fine antlered stag, with a youthful figure on either
side of it, with a hand on one of its horns. All except the central figure
are naked. (p. 24)</blockquote>

The cauldron: 

<blockquote>Had been beaten out of a single sheet of silver, and
decorated with a series of plates, inside and out. A round medallion was
fitted in the centre, and there were five inner and seven outer panels,
on which traces of gilding remained and which were all richly ornamented,
soldered on to it...Before the bowl was deposited, however, these plates
had been torn off with considerable force and placed inside it. (p. 25)
</blockquote><p>
<blockquote>It is 69 cm in diameter and 42 cm high. (p. 26)</blockquote>

<p>On the island, "There is a whole army of stones...some enormous...about
10m high, others smaller but elaborately decorated." (p. 31)

<p>Quite varied and diverse have been the interpretations suggested for
these finds, and it is good to be aware that certainty is lacking even
on such basic points as whether the ship at Sutton Hoo contained a body,
cremated remains or was a cenotaph for a ruler whose body was lost in
battle or placed in a Christian grave. And, the Gundestrup Cauldron has
been thought to have been crafted in Denmark, in Gaul, near the Black
Sea, in India, in Persia, etc. "Suggested dating has varied from the fourth
century BC to the sixth century AD." (p. 27) It is always a good idea to
be aware of the difference between reasonable hypothesis and certain fact.

<p>The stumble on metric conversion on page 20 is not the only indication
that this scholar's quite fascinating book received imperfect proof
reading. On page 22 it is suggested that additions were made to a wooden
amphitheatre on the hill at Yeavering by one Edwin, who became king of the
East Anglians around 625 CE and converted to Christianity some three
hundred and two years later [sic]. And, while only the impression is
conveyed on page 6 that Constantinople was situated on the lower Dneiper,
the same page contains the astonishing statement that the fine ships of the
Vikings took them to, "The western" [sic] "shores of North America."

<p>Notwithstanding such irritations, or amusements, H.E. Davidson's
awareness of and selection of the material related to her theme, her
presentation of a range of efforts to understand what remains from the
Paleopagan Celts and Germans, and her scholarly consciousness of the
limits of certain knowledge offer the reader a very valuable work.

<p>The second chapter is called "Glimpses of the Gods." This offers
thoughts concerning the deities drawn from medalions, brooches, coins,
dedicatory stones, monuments, place names, personal names, names and titles 
of gods, etc.

<p>Some 300 bracteates (medallions) have been found in graves, in
treasure hoards and in the ground. It is thought that these were amulets
worn as necklaces, placed in the ground to produce fertility and with 
treasure for protection. "A number have runic inscriptions, unfortunately
not easy to deceipher." (p. 40) They show figures and symbols which suggest
deities such as Wodan, Thor Tyr, etc. There are illustrations of some
bracteates in this chapter.

<p>Dedicatory inscriptions provide an opportunity for increased
knowledge or oppinion on deities, although even when such are named with a
Roman counterpart, the less precise function of Celtic and Germanic gods 
needs to be remembered. For example, 

<blockquote>Titles such as Mercurius Mercator and
Negotiator in inscriptions recall one of Odin's names Farmatyr, 'God of
Cargoes', a side of the god that tends to be forgotten because of the 
emphasis placed on him as god of battle. (p. 48)</blockquote>

<p>Also, "The strongest
emphasis in Icelandic poetry is on Odin's power to inspire poets." (p. 48)

<p>Also of interest are artistic themes on monuments, especially when
such appear to correspond to literary material, for example, Thor
fishing for the World Serpent.

<p>Place names, treated cautiously, can also provide additional
information. 

<blockquote>The term hof in Scandinavian place-names...is often
translated 'temple' but seems sometimes to have been used for secular
enclosures and buildings. [...] Even if hof names can be traced back to
medieval times, they may merely indicate chapels built by Christians. 
[...] In Denmark the word hylde is found in place-names, and is thought
to mean a shrine of wood or possibly a wooden platform on which the gods
were placed. (p. 55)</blockquote>

<p>The author refers to places named after the Celtic
deities Anu and Lug and after the Germanic Odin, Thor Tyr, Freyr, etc.
    
<p>Divine names and titles add material, ofter for contradictory views.

<blockquote>The important but elusive Celtic god Lug bears a name generally taken
to mean 'shining' or 'brilliant', and we are told in the literature that
his face shone. Many earlier scholars assumed, therefore that he was a sun
god. However, another school of thought derived his name from the word for
raven. (p. 59)</blockquote> 

<p>She reiterates the point that the Dagda means,
"'Generous in giving' rather than 'good' in any moral sense." (p. 59) "The
name Odin is derived from the adjective odr, meaning 'raging' or
'intoxicated'" (p. 60)

<p>Personally, what is most striking about this chapter, and the whole
book, is how very little actual information it contains concerning Celtic 
and Germanic paganism, and how very much controversy exists on so much of
what is mentioned. but, then, I guess, the title says it all.

<p>Chapter Three, "The Gods in the Myths", states, 

<blockquote>Although
anthropomorphic figures of gods were known in the northern Bronze Age, it
was not until the Romans were established in Gaul and Britain that the new
fashion of depicting deities in the form of men and women gradually became
popular among the native populations. (p. 64)</blockquote>

<p>It mentions humourous
aspects of the divine, the varied and perplexing nature of the sources
("Saxo, however, was a sophisticated Christian...Snorri, on the other
hand, wanted to retell the tales as they were found in early poetry." 
p. 69) Germanic and Irish.

<p>The author refers to the geography of the Otherworld. She writes,

<blockquote>There is little evidence for an established priesthood of the gods in
Scandinavia, but there are references to wise men at the courts of kings
who gave counsel, interpreted dreams, and foretold the future." (p. 68)
She mentions the Irish immrama. She proceeds with, "The central tree of
the gods... (p. 68)</blockquote> 

<p>and how the centre was, "Represented in local sacred
places by a tree or a pillar, a mound or a great stone." (p. 68). She
enumerates the nine Norse worlds as depicted in the poem "Alvissmal" and
writes of the cosmography portrayed in the poem "Voluspa". She refers to
Battles between the gods, including the two battles of Mag Tuired, the
tale of the building of Asgard and other stories about the gods, such as
that of the binding of the wolf.

<p>Next, she considers such individual gods as Odin ("Odin appears in
the northern myths in three main aspects, as ruler of the land of the
dead, god of battle, and god of inspiration, magic and wisdom." p. 76
"There is no doubt that Odin in the myths displays certain shamanic
characteristics." p. 77), Lug, Thor ("He is associated with storms and
wind, but above all with thunder and lightning...Thor in various myths is
said to be absent from Asgard, busy killing giants." p. 80), the Dagda,
Loki, Bricriu, etc.

<p>Chapter Four, "The Cults of the Northern Gods," considers worship and
cult rituals, noting, "Since much of the literary evidence was recorded in
Christian monasteries, we face the usual difficulties of possible
misunderstandings and prejudice." (p. 87) She mentions that, "There is
little archaeological evidence for elaborate temples in pre-Christian
Scandinavia." (p. 87) She refers to the druids for the Celts and kings and
chiefs for the Germanic peoples making, 

<blockquote>Contact with the gods on behalf
of the people at the sacrificial feasts held at certain fixed points of
the year...The most important of these was that marking the new year,
celebrated at the end of October, at the beginning of winter. This feast
lasted over a number of days, and was known as the Winter Nights in
Scandinavia, corresponding to the feast of Samain among the Celts. 
(p. 88) </blockquote>

<p>She mentions the feast with its drinking to the gods, its animal
sacrifice ("The three animals singled out in the literature as sacrifices
are the boar, the bull and the stallion, all three fighting animals,
appropriate offerings for warrior peoples." p. 90), divination, etc.

<blockquote>Besides the feasting, there would be sports, racing, wrestling and many
other activities and contests, probable including story-telling and the
recounting of myths about the gods. (p. 93)</blockquote> 

<p>She proceeds with reference
to oaths, the sacred ring, outlawry and Ibn Fadlan's account of the Rus in
AD 921.

<p>Then she examines the gods of warriors, the taking and the display of
heads, sacrifice of prisoners ("Drawing lots to decide which out of a
number of prisoners should be sacrificed, so that the choice might be made
by the gods." p. 96), and cults of the gods Odin, Thor and Freyr.

<p>Odin is, "The favourite god of those devoted to the craft of fighting
in the Viking Age." (p. 98) "The cult of Odin included the knoeledge of
battle spells." (p. 99) This included both the fearlessness of the beserks
and casting panic upon the enemy. He was also concerned with rulership and
poetry.

<blockquote>Thor figures above all in the literature as protector of gods and
mankind, supporting law and order and the good of the community more
wholeheartedly than any other god. (p. 103)</blockquote> 

<p>She mentions, 

<blockquote>The popularity
of the hammar sign...used to mark boundary-stones...raised over a new-born
child...brought in at weddings to hallow the bride...depicted on memorial
stones for the dead. (p. 101)</blockquote><p>

<blockquote>Those who looked on Freyr as a special protector were likely to be
closely linked with the land or guardians of a sacred place under the rule
of the deity. (p. 103)</blockquote><p>

<blockquote>Another characteristic of places sacred to Freyr
in Sweden and Norway was that sacred horses were kept there. (p. 104)</blockquote><p>

<blockquote>Freyr, god of the land, could be evoked by the Swedes as a god of battle
also, since his emblem the boar, was set on shields and helmets and was a
favourite symbol for warriors. (p. 106)</blockquote>

<p>Chapter Five, "Goddesses and Guardian Spirits", begins by noting, "We
have little evidence as to how they were worshipped." (p. 107) The author
mentions that our records were written by men, many of them monks. She
refers to the plural nature of such as, "The norns, valkyries and various
female spirits of the Vanir" (p. 107) and the triple nature of some Celtic
goddesses.

<p>She names such popular goddesses as Nehalennia, Epona and Rosmerta
and proceeds to consider the concept of the Great Goddess, suggesting that
Freja and Frigg may be the same individual. She then moves on to various
myths concerning Freja 

<blockquote>In the poem LOKASENNA, where Loki accuses her of
accepting most of the gods as her lovers. [...] And was said in
GRIMNISMAL 14 to possess half the slain while half passed to Odin. [...]
Freja is represented as possessing a famous necklace, Brisingamen, if
indeed it is a necklace and not, as some have claimed, a girdle or an
amulet of some kind. [...] Another precious possession of Freja was her
'feather-form', which enabled her to fly as a bird. [...] Her tears are
of gold, and she is a giving goddess, bringing prosperity and riches.
p. 109)</blockquote> 

<p>and then the concept of the territorial goddess (including
consideration of Brigantia and Brigid. 

<blockquote>In Cormac's GLOSSARY Brigid had
two sisters of the same name, daughters of the Dagda, one of whom
specialized in healing and one in the craft of the smith. She was
associated with such crafts as dyeing, weaving and the brewing of ale, and
with the welfare of flocks and herds, as well as with the art of poetry,
and with traditional learning, divination and prophecy. (p. 112)</blockquote> 

<p>and next
the family guardian spirit, bestowing in medieval and recent folklore
gifts upon the family. She continues with references to various spirits,
helping, foretelling, protecting.

<p>Next she looks at attitudes towards the dead, both fear of the
restless and welcome for the assistance and inspiration of ancestors,
including that from burial mounds.

<p>She concludes the chapter by underlining: 

<blockquote>It is evident that the
guardian spirits of the pre-Christian religion cannot be easily arranged
in clearly defined compartments. It is important to recognize their
complexity, and also how such concepts continued to develop in Christian
literature. (p. 125)</blockquote>

Chapter Six, "Contacts With the Otherworld", surveys, 

<blockquote>...what appear to
be the outstanding characteristics of the religious life of the
Scandinavians before the conversion. [...] Early accounts of the Celts and 
Germans from outside observers
stress the use of sacred places in the open air, rough wooden figures of
the gods, and the practice of animal and human sacrifices, as well as the
leaving of offerings in water or in earth. (p. 128)</blockquote><p>

<blockquote>Reliance on messages
received from dreams, signs and omens, and various forms of divination is
indicated in the written sources, and continued to be of importance
throughout the Viking Age. (p. 132)</blockquote>

<p>She goes on to consider processions, funeral traditions, fate and holy places.

<p>She concludes by reminding us, 

<blockquote>The purpose of this survey has been
to show how much material has in fact been left for us to study, and the
various ways in which we may go about it. (p. 160)</blockquote> 

<p>She seems to have
carried off her intent splendidly. The book is richly adorned with
references to the vernacular literatures and is well-embellished with
glimpses of the growing corpus of uncovered archaeological remains. It is
very highly recommended to anyone interested in the topic.
