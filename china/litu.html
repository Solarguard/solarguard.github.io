LI PO and DU FU, translated by Arthur Cooper, Penguin, Harmondsworth,
1973.

This charming bridge bearing the English reader to an encounter with
these two highly esteemed T'ang poets begins with a remarkable
introduction (pp. 15-101), an impressive and erudite stroll through a
poetic and literary garden tastefully tended by the translator.

Arthur Cooper introduces us to the different natures of Li Po (701-762,
more Yin, Taoist, mystical, perhaps a bit Turkish influenced) and Tu Fu
(712-770, more Yang, Confucian, practical), outlines the vagaries of
their lives in times of peace and of war, notes their rather
unresponsive and unimpressive compliance with expectations that men of
such literary calibre ought to be of governmental service and describes
the poetic tapestry in which these two strands gleam.

The poetical background from its gaze at the forms and dominant
personalities starting with the BOOK OF ODES, to its dancing references
to outstanding peaks in global literature (Irish, English, French,
German, Latin, Greek, Persian among them) to its studied consideration
of poetical forms, general human thought patterns and the specific
strengths of the Chinese language (including the continuity and
conciseness of the written character) is presented awesomely.

In addition Arthur Cooper discusses intelligently the possibilities of
translating poetry from one language into another. He points out that
poetic translations can be better than prose translations of poems,
though, of course, something is lost.

After the treat of his introduction comes the body proper of this work.
Here are (pp. 105-160) twenty five poems by Li Po, including: "The Road
to Shu is Steep," "A Song of Adieu to the Queen of the Skies After a
Dream Voyage to Her," "We Fought South of the Walls" and "The Ballad of
Yu-Chang." This last is mentioned in the notes as composed as Li Po in
757 joined the Prince of Lu to oppose An Lu-shan rebels, only to be
exiled on the disclosure and defeat of the prince himself as a rebel.

The poems here in English seem in many places mystic, allusive,
descriptive of nature, referencing the poet's fondness for drink, dream
and voyaging.

There are twenty seven poems (two on page 163 and nine beginning on
page 196) by Tu Fu (pp. 163-244), including: "Lament by the Riverside,"
"On Seeing a Painting of Horses by General Ts'ao Pa at Secretary Wei
Feng's House," "Ballad on Seeing a Pupuil of the Lady Kung-sun Dance
the Sword Mime" and half of (verses 21-90) "Journey North,"

The poems here in English seem somewhat occasional, well-crafted,
nostalgic, involved in the world and the lives of the people,
hospitable and longing.

Arthur Cooper has provided ample notes, slipping amonst them some seven
other poems or parts of poems, including Tu Fu's offering at the age of
six, "Now I am six/ I feel very strong/ And open my mouth/ With a
Phoenix Song."

In addition, Shui Chein-tung has contributed his calligraphic rendering
of a dozen of the selected poems.

The translator admits some of his verbal choices, his omission, for
example, of, "some technicalities of the organization of the corps de
ballet," his using Astrakhan for "West of the Yangtse," and it will be
noted that his "Antioch's waves" on page 152 is rendered "Parthian
Seas" by Arthur Waley on page 228 of Cyril Birch's ANTHOLOGY OF CHINESE
LITERATURE.

Whatever poetic liberties he has taken, whatever has been lost in
translation, these poems are enjoyable in English. The volume is of
great value, in part because it allows the reader access to the
translator's sensitive experience and inspired and studied poetic
views.

More Tu Fu poems may be seen in translation in Penguin's complementry 
volume, POEMS OF THE LATE T'ANG, transl. A.C. Graham, Harmondsworth, 
1965. He begins this section of his anthology with a page or so 
introduction that starts, "There is a general consensus that Tu Fu is 
the greatest of all Chinese poets." He notes previous translators
(Ayscough, Hung and Rewi Alley). He states that only poems from Tu 
Fu's last four years have been included.

Selected here are: "The Autumn Wastes" (in five eight line stanzas), 
"At the Corner of the World," "Midnight," "Stars and Moon on the 
Yangtse," "To My Younger Brother," "Yangtse and Han," "Deep in Winter,"
(all in one eight line stanza) and "Autumn Meditation" (in eight eight
line stanzas).

These poems in English convey the poet's remoteness from home and 
family, his declining years in a troubled Empire, his awareness of and 
receptivity to the beauty of the natural world and his attunement to
his rich and lengthy cultural heritage.

These poems seem well worth reading and the notes appended to some of
them are interesting to gaze at.

This translation in the rest of A.C. Graham's little volume seems 
especially attracted to what strikes him as unusual or excessive. He
has chosen some twenty two poems from Li Ho, whom in part he describes
as follows:

   Li Ho is the most remarkable case in Chinese literature of a poet
   recently rediscovered after long neglect. He does not appear at all
   in the most familiar anthologies, such as the eighteenth-century
   THREE HUNDRED T'ANG POEMS. Although famous in the ninth century and
   never quite forgotten, he offended the conventionality of later 
   taste by his individuality and its health and balance by his 
   morbidity and violence. To see his peculiar qualities as virtues
   required the breakdown of traditional literary standards in the
   nineteenth and twentieth centuries. (p. 89)

He has some eighteen poems from Li Shang-yin (812?-858), whom he notes 
as an especially good poet and still presents to his English reader 
with in part the following accented:

   It is well known that the theme of love has a much smaller place 
   in Chinese poetry than in our own. Tenderness in classical poetry, 
   however deep, is a temperate feeling for friends, kinsmen and - in
   no different spirit - wives; any more violent passion is an excess
   unsuitable for poetry; the only physical intoxication which offers
   glimpses of eternity is the ecstasy of wine... 

   ...the love of women is the major of the one great poet of the 
   poet of the period, Li Shang-yin.

   Until very recently commentators were embarassed by this awkward
   fact...

   The romantic value of love for Li Shang-yin shows startling in 
   certain poems about Imperial concubines, "Crooked River" and 
   "Ma-wei, which assume, to the disgust of commentators, that a
   private love should matter more to an Emperor than the ruin of his 
   state. (pp. 141-143)

There are some dozen poems from Meng Chiao (751-814) presented in 
part thusly: "Many have detested what Su Shih (Su Tung-p'o, 
1036-1101) described as his 'cold cicada's call'... Many of his 
expressions are extremely violent to Chinese ears." (p. 57)

A.C. Graham also translates "nearly half" of Lu T'ung's (d. 835) 
"Eclipse of the Moon," which he describes as, "U unique and 
freakish curiosity." (p. 81)

Also selected is Han Yu's (768-824) ninth "Autumn Thought," 
"Withered Tree," Evening: for Chang Chi and Chou K'uang" and three
extracts from  "South Mountain." He does mention Han Yu's strength
in flexible old prose and role in the Confucian reassertion from 
contemporary prevailing Buddhist influences. In keeping with his
comments on other poets, he refers to Han Yu's power to 'make beauty
out of ugliness' and notes:

   The feature which has always distinguished Han Yu's circle for
   Chinese readers is a taste for 'strange' and 'daring' imagery, 
   for conceits, fantasy and grotesquery. p. 72  

Also included in the selection is Tu Mu with some score of poems.
A.C. Graham underlines this poet's joyfulness. There is some 
conveyed in these offerings in English, and also some regret and 
longing, "There are seventy-five post stations from here to home."
(p.128) "I waste my hopes by rivers and lakes, a fishing rod in the
hand." (p. 129)  

I figure that much of this offering by the translator has more to do 
with his assessment of the kind of advertising he feels will secure
him greatest attention in his contemporary English speaking world,
though, by his own admission, normal taste may not treat his volume
as kindly as he expects in his own lifetime.
