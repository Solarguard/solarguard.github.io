SON OF HEAVEN, C.P. Fitzgerald, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1933

This splendid introduction to Li Shih-Min (T'ai Tsung) to the English reader 
begins with a prologue (pp. 1-12) broadly sketching the centuries of disunity 
in China after the collapse of the Han dynasty. Outlined are foreign conquest 
of the north, the instability caused by contentious clans in both north and 
south the enormous influence of Chinese culture on the nomadic conquerors, the 
reunification of China by Yang Chien and the failure of Yang's son Ti.

Chapter One, ”The Downfall of the Sui Dynasty” (pp. 13-30) begins with Li 
Shih-Min's birth (c. 600 C.E.), the prominence of his family, the youngster's 
accomplishments in calligraphy, horsemanship and archery, Yang Ti's expensive 
rebuilding in style of Lo Yang and Yang Chou, construction of the Grand Canal 
between them, purchase of Central Asian acknowledgement of his suzeraignty 
and costly invasions of Korea causing rebellion. Eight rebellions are enumerated 
with their geographical successes, excluding that of Li Shih-Min. Yang Ti 
sojourned in the south until slain by his discontented troops.

Chapter Two, ”The Foundation of the T'ang Dynasty A.D. 617-18” (pp. 31-49) 
mentions prophecies that Li will succeed Sui, the relatively hesitant father 
of the youthful, energetic, militarily brilliant Li Shih-Min and of the heroic 
heroine Li Shih, forceful thrusts and the fall of Ch'ang An.

Chapter Three, ”The Conquest of Western China A.D. 618-620” (pp. 50-69), notes 
the prudence of Li Shih-Min, refusing to be drawn too far too son, either east 
or west, points out the ancient ”horizontal” strategy he replicated, sketches 
some of the contentious conflicting ambitions that cut lives short and devastated 
armies, and indicates the stamina and determination of Li Shih-Min striking 
through the Squirrel Pass when the time was right:

Pausing neither for food nor rest, the T'ang army drove the enemy headlong through 
the defile, fighting ten separate engagements, after covering nearly seventy miles 
in twenty-four hours.  After a prodigious slaughter of the flying mob, the prince 
drove Sung Chin-Kang out of the northern mouth of Squirrel Pass into the city of 
Chieh Hsiu. Then the T'ang army exhausted by these efforts, was allowed to encamp. 
The generals, who feared that the prince could be exposed to danger in the furious 
chase, had begged him to take rest, but Shih-Min, who had waited months for this 
moment, replied, ”Opportunity comes seldom and is easily missed. Superiority, 
acquired with difficulty, can be lost in a moment”. During this period Shih-Min 
took no food for two days and did not put off his armour for three. p. 66

This action and its followup eliminated one imperial contender and gained 
adherents for the T'ang cause. It also led two rivals to join together against T'ang.

Chapter Four, ”The Battle of Ssu Shui A.D. 620-1” (pp. 70-89), commences with 
serious T'ang losses in Honan. Li Shi-Min moved on lo Yang and rejected a 
partition of the empire. The emperor of Hsia advanced to support beleagured 
Lo Yang. Li Shih-Min with elite troops moved against him, demonstrated his 
prowess with the bow, his skill in placing ambush and his superb attention 
to choosing the apt moment to act. Tou Chien-Te chivalrously supported Lo 
Yang when advised to strike across less defended T'ang territory. He drew his 
army up for battle. Li Shih-Min attacked only when heat and thirst had disordered 
it. Li was overwhelmingly victorious slaying three thousand and taking fifty 
thousand prisoners, including the Hsia emperor himself. Lo Yang surrendered and 
was spared.

Shih-Min on his return to court made a triumphal entry into Ch'ang An. Clad in 
a suit of golden armour, the conqueror rode through the city, followed by 
two captive emperors and their courts, twenty-five of his own generals, and 
10,000 heavy armed horsemen. Such were the fruits of the famous battle of Ssu 
Shui which, since it established the T'ang dynasty on an unshakable basis, and 
made possible the reunion of China, may be reckoned as one of the decisive 
battles in the history of the world. p. 89

Chapter Five, “Pacification and Consolidation A.D. 622-4” (pp. 90-106), 
begins with the surprise strike through dangerously high water against the 
Liang territory in the south. Liang forces rushing to support their capital 
were shattered to observe many wrecked Liang ships floating downriver. The 
emperor Hsiao Hsien surrendered to spare his people. They were spared and 
the Liang empire peacefully absorbed by T'ang. The emperor of the southeast 
coast was quickly defeated. There was an uprising in the east, but Li 
Shih-Min's military acumen asserted T'ang supremecy.

This great achievement, the conquest of a vast empire in less than seven 
years, was the work of Li Shih-Min; nor can his father, Li Yuan, whom he 
had made emperor, be said to have contributed in any way to the glorious 
result. Left to himself, Li Yuan's policy was weak, indecisive, and vacillating. 
Had it not been for the foresight, the determination, and the courage of 
Li Shih-Min, the T'ang dynasty would never have triumphed over its rivals, 
and China would have remained a chaos of warring states. p. 106

Chapter Six, “The Hsuan Wu Gate, A.D. 626,” (pp. 107-124), opens with usual 
court intrigues and sibling rivalries. Li Shih-Min checked the Turks and 
avoided his brother's attempt to have him assassinated. Later he was 
poisoned, but survived. Efforts were made to bribe Shih-Min's officers 
and transferhis troops from his control. He struck back with force. His 
brothers were killed. Two months later the emperor abdicated and Li Shih-Min, 
aged twenty-six, came to the throne.

There follows a four page “Interlude” on the new emperor's character: 
decisive in battle, uncomprehending of the scheming mindset of the intriguing 
courtier.

Chapter Seven, ”The Conquest of the Turks A.D. 624-630” (pp. 129--146), opens 
with the general nomad problem, a quick survey of the situation in Li Shih-Min's 
day and the various tribes facing him. Accounts there are of Shih-Min fighting 
the Turks and of their approach to Ch'ang An a few months after his elevation 
to the throne.

The next day the emperor rode out again, met Qadir at the Wei bridge, and 
concluded a treaty of peace, which was sealed in the Turkish custom by 
sacrificing a white horse. The Turks then withdrew from China, and this time 
the peace was carefully observed. p. 140

Bad weather and politics led to fighting. Within four years li Shih-Min had 
broken Turkish power south of the Gobi.

Chapter Eight, ”The Court of Ch'ang An A.D. 630-40” (pp. 147-168), opens with 
Li Shih-Min's ability to appoint apt subordinates. Chung-Sun Wu-Chi, Wei Cheng, 
Fang Hsuan-Ling, Hsiao Yu and others are outlined. The emperor's own ideal's 
are quoted:

“There are three things which should be said of me”, remarked the emperor. ”First, 
that I have attempted to imitate the wise conduct of the ancient emperors. Secondly, 
that with the assistance of the able men whom I have chosen, I have restored the 
laws, which had perished, and revived the power of the government. Thirdly, that 
rejecting unworthy ministers and incompetent officiers,  I have never listened to 
the flattery of those intriguers who are the principal cause of the bad government 
and misconduct of princes. If I can continue in this way to my death, what evil 
can be recorded against me. p. 152

The emperor's perspicacity and sensitivity are exampled.

The most convincing proof of the justice and tranquillity which the authority of 
Shih-Min established in China came to light after his death, when his son and 
successor was informed by the President of the Board of Punishments, on the 
occasion of a proposed amnesty to inaugurate the new reign, that in all the 
empire there were only fifty men serving penal sentences, and only two under 
condemnation of death. p. 155

The emperor revived education and civil administration. There were natural sorrows, 
such as the loss of his consort Chang Sun in 636 C.E. In 639 a band of Turks 
working in the imperial stables failed to assassinate him. Remarkable exploits, 
including crossing the K'un lun mountains, enabled Shih-Min's generals, especially 
Hou Chun-Chi, to overcome Central asian enemies. A Tibetan invasion was defeated 
and a civilizing Chinese princess sent to Tibet. T'ang extension to Karahodja is 
noted and an Islamic tradition connecting Li Shih-Min and Muhammad:

According to Mohammadan tradition it was at this time that Arab traders brought 
the faith of Islam to Canton. They state that when Mohammad was about to send 
out his armies to convert the world at the point of the sword, he addressed a 
letter, urging acceptance of his creed, to the three greatest emperors in the 
world--Heraclius of Rome, Chosroes of Persia and Shih-Min who reigned in China. 
Heraclius ignored the fanatic's letter, Chosroes tore it across in a rage, 
whereupon the Arab envoy exlaimed, “So shall God rend your kingdom from you”. 
Only the sage emperor of China gave careful and tolerant attention to the Prophet's 
words, permitting the Arabs to build the first mosque in China at Canton. pp. 167-168

Chapter Nine, “The Tragedy of Crown Prince Ch'eng-Ch'ien A.D. 643” (pp. 169-186), 
opens with the wild Turkish nature of the crown prince, and the admirable qualities 
of Li T'ai (Prince Wei) a concubine's son. The two, of course, are bitter rivals. 
Another concubine's son became the centre of an eastern rebellion and was speedily 
overcome. The investigation of this rebellion disclosed a greater conspiracy led 
by Crown Prince Ch'eng-Ch'ien and including the famous general Hou Chun-Chi. The 
general was executed, but his wife and son were sent to permanent exile in Canton. 
Both Ch'eng-Ch'ien and Prince Wei were banished and both soon died. Li Chi, Prince 
Chin, became crown prince and eventually emperor.

Chapter ten, ”The Korean War and the Closing Years A.D. 645-650” (pp. 187-207), 
opens with a coup in Korea in 642, the dictaor's moves on Silla, Silla's appeal 
to China and Li Shih-Min's energetic response. Striking by land and by sea, 
exposing the Koreans to the impact of heavy cavalry and taking advantage of 
weather, ambush and surprise, the Chinese scored impressive successes. However, 
strongly fortified An Shih Ch'eng proved impervious to T'ang attack. Impending 
winter forced Li Shih-Min to withdraw.

Turks seeking to exploit Chinese focus on korea suffered a severe defeat. Envoys 
came from afar, including some tall, blue-eyed red heads. Chinese envoys collected 
tribute and waged war, even in India.

Li Shih-Min, physically weakened by the Korean campaign, failed to recover full 
health. He passed away in 649 in his forty ninth year. The throne passed peacefully 
to his heir.

There is an appendix (p. 208) showing a chart of Chinese dynastic periods, and one 
(pp. 209-215) connecting population estimates to the number of cities. The book also 
has an index (pp. 217-232) that provides both romanization and Chinese characters 
for the names referenced, maps and plates showing the emperor's famous horses.

No complete comment on this book could avoid noticing Li Shih-Min's interest in the 
historical records being made of his reign. Since these seem to provide the only 
primary source material for the central narrative, some scepticism as to the absolute 
trustworthiness of the characterizations of Li shih-Min's father, brothers and sons, 
for example, would be understandable. Nevertheless, the fact remains that this great 
consolidator of the T'ang dynasty did play a highly significant role in transmitting 
to succeeding generations an impressive foundation upon which grew some of the finest 
harvests in Chinese cultural history.
