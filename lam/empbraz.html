EMPIRE IN BRAZIL, C.H. Haring, Norton, New York, 1968 (1958)<p>

Fascinating account of the Brazilian Empire, i.e. 1822-1889. I had
started this a year ago. However, over the Holidays I was able to read
it through. The dominant impressions are of the peaceful declaration of
independence and relative stability of Imperial Brazil, and the towering
personality of Dom Pedro II who ruled for the last 49 years.<p>

Michael McKenny, "Grey Glyphs" VII, January 1986.<p>
