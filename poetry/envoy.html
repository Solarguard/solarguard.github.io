ENVOY'S LAMENT

I'm told to hold my tongue. I may not say
What weighs ablaze inside my mind today.
My fears, the tears that flow I know can't show.
The roar of war demands I hate the foe.

A world unfurled to me a jewel serene.
I knew a blue unknown, a green unseen,
A breeze to ease my soul, an air so fair
It seemed I dreamed to find a spot so rare.

This place's race I found. A mind refined,
Their arts, their hearts awoke a kind of bind.
So young they swung above the skies their gaze.
Their youth in truth recalled our dawning days.

"We'll teach, we'll reach to learn for good of all."
Instead they said we're bugs that crawl to fall.
I cried and tried to speak of peace apace.
"We'll fight on sight and blast your race from space."

"Their word you've heard, a thing no ear should hear.
I plead a need for peace. Their star's not near.
Let live. Let's give. Let time to age remain."
"To wait too late a chance to gain but pain."

O Life, as strife unfolds before my eyes,
As ships on trips of death from home arise,
I weep to reap unsought this birth of dearth.
Alone I moan the foe, the worth of Earth.
