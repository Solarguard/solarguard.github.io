THE STRANDED SAILOR

I stand upon a far and distant shore,
And I wonder sadly why am I here.
I have not seen Tsoor for two years or more.
My men are downcast and burdened with fear.

They're just simple sailors, can't understand
The way we've passed the world, that maps all lie.
Shaken, trembling they wonder when they'll die
In this weird Atlantis, this mountain land.

I carve here our tale of woe on a stone
How after two years daring came Adod.
How Yam Nahar ever westerly flowed
Till on this far distant shore we were thrown.

Perhaps in a thousand years men will see
These Phoenician sketchings on this hard rock,
Shake their heads in wonder that here we walk,
Praise the boldness of so vast a journey.

I feel this is the height of our grandeur.
Never shall Kena'im wander further.
Never shall Tsoor see a greater sailor.
Past here my people shall never venture.

Though I could I will not here write my name.
If in future men come upon this place,
Let them marvel at our Phoenician race.
I am Phoenician seaman, that's my fame.

So bards write your epics and sing your songs,
Colour your portrait of a daring man.
describe me better than I ever can.
Yet know your hero his fair city longs.

So I stand upon this far distant shore,
gazing from the coast of an unknown land,
The weird horizon now so close at hand,
In this pale region where western clouds soar.

My misty eyes drift sadly to the east,
Watching the rising of the morning sun,
Thinking long ago, two long years undone,
When on a fair harbour these eyes could feast.

I know I'll meet Mot here in this Sad-El.
Then finally my spirit will soar free
And speed across the waters of the sea.
In Sidon's sunrise i'll forever dwell.

This poem was written by Michael Mckenny on January 12, 1973 when
he was homesick in India. It recalls a legend that the Phoenicians
who sailed around Africa in the early 6th Century BCE lost a ship
which reached the Brazilian coast. Tsoor is Tyre, Kena'im means
Phoenicians, Adod is the storm god, Yam Nahar is the sea god, Mot
is the god of death, Sad-El (Ruler's Field) is the Western Paradise
and Sidon a Phoenician city.
