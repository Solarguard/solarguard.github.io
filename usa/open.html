Greetings from Ottawa, Canada.

I would like to express my sincerest appreciation for the extent to
which the government and the people of the United States have over
the past two centuries demonstrated a noteworthy contribution to the
well-being of the entire planet. I add my voice to those who already
have observed, recorded and applauded the existence on the North
American continent of this Great Western Republic rooted in the very
best ideals of humanitarianism, of respect for individual rights and
opportunities and of consideration for local, regional and national
interests. There are many shining examples, episodes and historical
periods replete with the stirring examples of American altruism.

Included in the long list of impressive American attitudes, ideals
and actual achievements is the remarkable contribution this nation
has made to global understanding, peace and harmony through the
creation, growth and development of planetary institutions. All can
testify that the League of Nations was the gift of an American
president to the people of the world and that the United Nations is
permanently headquartered in a great American city.

This far reaching American determination to promote the tolerance,
harmony and peace of the human species calls forth admiration, deep
appreciation and respectful thanks, especially in a time of some
considerable misunderstanding and conflict. The American leadership
(in my view) is fully informed that the current international policy
it has undertaken does not appeal to a great many people and a
large assemblage of protesters in the path of President Bush is not
going to come as a surprise to him or any of those in his circle. I
do not think such a protest will have much effect on his attitude,
nor on his coming actions.

Difficult as it may be to convince those who may indeed achieve some
moral benefit from being able to register so personally their strong
rejection of the way American muscle has come to be flexed in recent
times, it is my opinion that a greater impact would be exerted on
the president and those around him were there to be instead no mass
assembly of objectors, but rather a number of alternative and fully
respectful actions undertaken in the course of his visit. These are
ideas specifically presented to those able to participate during his
visit to Ottawa, Canada, and these ideas, at all levels exist at all
times and places where he may happen to be in the future.

I believe it ought to be possible to obtain more signatures on very
respectful, though thoroughly clear petitions urging a reasonable,
responsible and restrained use of American military might. Everyone,
in my opinion, ought to be fully conscious that the security fears
of American administrators are not without foundation, precisely on
account of the impulsive and inconsiderate actions that have seen an
increase in animosity against this president, his government and by
shorthand identification the entire United States. Of course, very
many Americans also opposed such actions, as the recent election so
clearly indicates. These people had their choice overtaken in the US
democratic manner by the will of the larger number. So, the success
of Bush in the election, the apparent probability of a persistence
in confrontational and adversarial policies naturally attract the
very anger and vengeance that the president claims to be combating.

Letters, petitions, prayers issued by those who would influence the
president, his advisors, the course of American foreign policy ought
to contain awareness of legitimate American security concerns, and,
in my estimation connect this concern to a reasoned understanding of
how best the safety of the American people may be achieved. It is my
assessment that the greatest enhancement of security for the United
States, for any other country and for the world as a whole emerges
through the transition of national identity and all other identities
from specific to global. When the primary, basic and fundamental
awareness of the individuals on this planet is to the human
homeworld, the human species, humanity, then it will be much more
difficult to imagine and carry out destructive acts against others.
The long term solution to the threats of popularly backed terrorist
strikes against any land, or the military invasion of any land is
for all to see themselves as citizens of one planetary nation. If
the founding fathers of the United States were wise to establish a
federation of their various states, so now these have grown to be
fifty joined together, this concept remains valid extended to the
planetary level. Indeed, it achieves special effect by embracing all
the states on Earth.

The comment that the existing United Nations is inadequate just
calls for insightful, determined and humane action to improve what
is deemed inferior, not to render it a servant of any excessive
flexing of particular interest, but to allow it to shine brightly on
the entire human population respecting each component part of the
one harmonious human nation.

More effective in my estimation than any massing of protestors
against a presidential visit is the communication of this ultimate
solution to human wars in an age of weapons of mass destruction. Not
Star Wars, but very attentive, humane and truly human centred action
to educate this species, its numerous factions, all their leaders of
their common humanity will most effectively reduce, instead of
increase, the danger to America or any other segment of humanity. I
would add that there is a spiritual aspect to this issue, and one
very important part of helping the growth of the species, beginning
a more noticeable transformation from national to human centred
policies is to recognize, call upon and pray for the support of the
ancestors, the spirits, Deity.

Peace be With You, Michael
