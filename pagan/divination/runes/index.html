<p>
The runes are recorded as being used since at least the time of the Roman historian Tacitus. Modern writers on the topic of note include Freya Aswynn, Edred Thorsson and Jennifer Smith. This site at present provides Michael McKenny's initial consideration of the elder futhark, his reviews of Freya Aswynn's very impressive NORTHERN MYSTERIES AND MAGICK, of Jennifer Smith's valuable RAIDO THE RUNIC JOURNEY, of Edred Thorsson's decent RUNECASTER'S HANDBOOK, of Jenny Blain's fascinating look at seidr and Michael's less than enthusiastic review of a New Age book loaned to him at Bealtaine 2003 C.E. This was last updated on July 4, 2003 C.E.<p>
