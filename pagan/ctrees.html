<center>CELTIC TREE MYSTERIES</center><p>

Steve Blamires, Llewellyn, St. Paul, 1997<p>

It is hoped that in the future this site will contain a separate section
on divination that will include a carefully considered description of
each of the characters of the ogham signary, possibly with reference to
the attributions to be found in this book and elsewhere.<p>

For now, the general comment on this book is that Blamires seems to have
drawn on a qabalistic background to present a program of moving along
the ogham letters in a procession similar to moving along the paths of
the Hebrew letters on the Tree of Life.<p>

Avoiding, at least for now, any debate as to the palaeopagan nature of
such a concept, or indeed about how the ogham letters may have been used
as a divinatory tool by the palaeopagans, I, personally do not resonate
at this stage in my life to this qabalistic application of ogham, and I
recognize that readers who do may well find this book a very interesting
seed for a growing awareness of their own journey from tree to tree.<p>

Of course, the general concepts of such a journey and of using the ogham
characters as a means to divination is what permits each individual to
strive for a personal grasp on the details of the nature of each letter,
of each path on the Tree of Life.<p>
