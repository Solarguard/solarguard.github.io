THE ELEMENTS OF THE I CHING, Stephen Karcher, Element Books,
Shaftesbury, U.K., 1995

This basic, popular, easy to read edition conveys in contemporary
English the essentials of this so absorbing divinatory system.

The foreward enlists the interest and empathy of the reader.

The introduction sites the ancient and mystical origin of the
oracle, mentions the tao, explains hexagrams, yin and yang and the
low key way of an insightful diviner.

The concepts of the eight trigrams are elucidated succinctly in
resonating English.

The methods of forming hexagrams with coin tosses and yarrow stalks
are clearly conveyed.

The sixty four hexagrams are listed in numerical order with a couple
of pages description of each.

Karcher's key words for the trigrams are: force, yield, shake,
ground, gorge, radiance, bound, open.

Karcher's key words for the hexagrams are:
1 force/persisting, 2 field/yielding, 3 sprouting, 4 enveloping,
5 attending, 6 arguing, 7 legions/leading, 8 grouping,
9 small accumulating, 10 treading, 11 pervading, 12 obstruction,

                                      16 providing for/responding

                                         60 articulating
61 centring accord 62 small exceeding 63 already fording 64 not yet
                                                            fording.  

The author states he has been studying the subject for more than
thirty years. His sensitive, comprehensible exposition testifies to
the rich harvest of this effort.

It is hoped this site will soon contain Michael McKenny's comments
on each of the sixty four hexagrams, in the same vein as his remarks
on the runes and the ogham. Karcher's observations already exist and
are well worth the consideration an appreciative reader exerts.

This book is highly recommended.
