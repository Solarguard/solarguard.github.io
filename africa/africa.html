THE PREHISTORY OF AFRICA, J. Desmond Clark, Thames and Hudson, 1970.

The text emerges from the 1969 Howard Shaw Lectures delivered at Bryn 
Mawr College in Pennsylvania. It begins by considering mention of 
Africa inhistory: references in Egyptian records to trade with Punt 
by 2,300 BCE, Fifth Century BCE references in Herodotus to travels be 
daring Nassamonians from near Cyrene to the Niger, Hanno's late Fifth 
Century BCE voyage along the West Coast of Africa, early CE trade by 
Greek, Arab and Indian merchants with East Africa. Then the 
Portuguese and subsequent other European arrival.

The author proceeds to consider the prehistorians use of prehistoric 
artifacts and problems of dating and interpretation of data. One may 
consider, "relative stratigraphic position...associated fauna," p. 23 
previously dated associated cultural material and chemical analysis. 
Concerning fauna:

   Certain genera showed remarkable evolutionary diversification in   
   the Pleistocene and are so much better chronological indicators    
   than others -- for instance, elephants, pigs, and some bovids      
   which are  especially good. Some genera are less useful in this    
   way as they show little or no change -- such as crocodiles,        
   rhinos, and to some extent hippos. p. 25

Then comes mention of potassium/argon, radiocarbon, palaeo-magnetism, 
uranium fission track and thermo-luminescence Chronometric Dating. 
The first is concentrated in volcanic regions, i.e. the Rift Valley. 
Next he refers to pollen analysis, examination of minerals and 
sediments and the archaeological corpus.

   up to the end of the Second World War the cultural material from a 
   dig -- tools, utilized artifacts and the waste products of flaking 
   -- was usually selected and not everything was saved p. 38

There had been a large number of terms used in African archaeology.

   in 1965, an attempt was made to obtain  more general uniformity of 
   usage. A graded series of four terms was proposed designed to show 
   the precise nature of the cultural being described... The smallest 
   cultural unit... is an Archaeological Horizon or Archaeological    
   Occurrence, the artifacts themselves forming an 'aggregate' or     
   'assemblage'. Where several aggregates from archaeological         
   occurrences can be shown to be closely related and to be distinct  
   from other entities these are grouped into a Phase. Phases may     
   succeed each other through time or may be contemporary; the term   
   'facies' has sometimes been used to describe the recurrent         
   differences recognizable within larger cultural units. Groups of   
   related aggregates, whether or not they have been grouped into     
   phases, which share a number of technical and typological factors  
   in recurrent associations and are more diversified than the        
   members of a Phase, are classified as an Industry. Industries      
   having specific traditions in common form an Industrial Complex.   
     p. 39

The author mentions the importance of distinguishing fact from 
interpretation. He also notes the observation of prehistoric patterns 
in some existing African populations.

Chapter Two, "The Emergence of Man the Tool-maker (pp. 46-75) begins 
by considering the main geographical zones: tropical, rain forest,  
savanna, dry steppe, desert and coastal (Mediterranean and Cape). The 
reader is reminded of climate variations through time as pollen 
remains demonstrate.

   Unfortunately, it is only in a comparatively few parts of the      
   continent that the fossils of the past twenty-five million years   
   are preserved and there is, for example, hardly a bone from the    
   whole of the west African forest zone or the Congo basin.          
   Similarily, vast areas of savannah on the central plateau and in   
   the east and south are also devoid of any fossil material because  
   of the acid nature of the soil and the ground-water. p. 50

   The main fossil-bearing regions are the Maghreb (northwest         
   Africa), the east African region of the Western and Gregory Rifts, 
   certain localities in South Africa, and a few isolated localities  
   in Egypt, the Saharah and Rhodesia. Far the richest of these is    
   the east African region. Here the formation of deep troughs,       
   basins and volcanoes, the rapid accumulation of sediments and      
   burial of the fossils have combined to preserve a unique record    
   extending back to the earlier Miocene, some twenty-two million     
   years ago. p. 50

There follows a survey of evolving Dryopithecus, Ramapithecus, 
Australopithecus, Homo habilis and Homo erectus with references to 
current primate and human hunter gatherer behavior.

   Defence of territory lies behind the aggressiveness of many        
   animals and of modern man, but the African apes do not appear to   
   engage in vigorous defence of their territory and, as we have      
   seen, their groupings are essentially open ones, the composition   
   of which is frequently changing. Territoriality in human societies 
   is very likely, therefore, to have come about appreciably later in 
   the Pleistocene. p. 67

The author considers the use of stones to break open nuts, or make 
points on digging sticks, location of sites near water, the 
importance of food-sharing in human societies, etc.

   It seems that one of the things that most infuriates a chimpanzee  
   is his inability to carry away more bananas than he can hold in    
   his arms, so that it is likely that, even at this early time, the  
   Man-Apes will have evolved some simple form of carrying device --  
   a piece of bark or skin, a hollow tree burl or a tortoise shell -- 
   more specifically for the collection of vegetable foods. p. 73

Chapter III, "Unspecialized Hunting Societies" (pp. 76-104), begins 
by stressing that hunting is not the major activity of such 
societies, that the main food of modern hunting peoples is vegetable. 
It proceeds to a consideration of the long Acheulian period, the 
possibly million years or so during which Acheulian assemblages 
occur. This leads to a look at Homo erectus (fossils of whom have 
been uncovered also in Java, Choukoutien in China and in Hungary).

   Acheulian tool-kits did not evolve from the Oldowan in east        
   Africa. The only other region with a comparable, long, cultural    
   and stratigraphic sequence is the Moroccan coast and here also the 
   earliest Achulian assemblages make an equally sudden appearance in 
   the succession in the beach gravels of the receding sea level      
   brought about by the onset of the Mindel glaciation. p. 84

The author refers to Achulian handaxes and scrapers, camping places 
at stream and river banks and lake and sea shores.

   Caves were also sometimes occupied -- over long periods of time as 
   the thirty feet of deposit at the Cave of Hearths in the northern  
   Transvaal shows. p. 94

He mentions different kinds of sites with different kinds of 
tool-kits. A range of estimates in suggested for some site 
populations. Several ideas are presented to account for rubble 
evidently carried onto sites:

   It has been suggested that this rubble may have provided the       
   foundation for a home base situated in swampy ground as protection 
   from predators; that it may have been used to hold down the base   
   of a wind-break or that it was ammunition for keeping away         
   scavengers and predators.   pp. 95

Spears and fire are evident in European sites and considered likely 
in contemporaneous Africa and the view humans may have caused species 
of large animals to go extinct in Africa is felt more likely by use 
of fire than by use of hand weapons. There is also consideration of 
language and the development of  the cerebral cortex and jaw, etc. 
facilitating this.

Chapter IV, "The Coming and Spread of Modern Man," (pp. 104-147), 
begins by mentioning climatic change with expanding icecaps, lowered 
sealevels and Mediterranean vegetation in northern and central 
Sahara. This period began some seventy thousand years ago and lasted 
until some ten thousand years ago. The author mentions the extension 
of human populations into new areas, rapid change in tool traditions. 
the evidence of Homo sapiens neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens 
rhodesiensis:

   If isolating palaeo-geographical factors brought about, as we      
   believe, biological as well as cultural adaptation, then selective 
   pressures acting on the gene pool were responsible for the         
   divergence that can be seen in the early Homo sapiens fossils from 
   Africa. At the same time, however, the mobility necessary for the  
   successful pursuit of hunting and gathering would, in favourable   
   circumstances, have encouraged gene glow and the rapid             
   transmission of selectively improved characteristics. It is        
   believed that it was in this way that modern man replaced the      
   Neanderthal races some forty to thirty thousand years ago. p. 120

Next comes consideration of the improved tool-kits and a rejection of 
the idea that Neanderthals or a conservative tradition lingered in 
southern Africa until ten thousand years ago. The tool-kits are 
interpreted as indicating regional selection of the most effective 
methods of hunting and other use. There is mention of ritual, of 
conflict, of concern for others possibly determined from 
archaeological remains. And the chapter closes with the thought:

   The rapidity with which all earlier forms of man were replaced is  
   more easily accounted for if the ability to use language as we     
   know it was a characteristic unique to modern man. It imparted to  
   the individual the ability to reason and discriminate and to the   
   group the means of stabilizing society so that culture could       
   continue to develop along established traditional lines. p. 147

Chapter V, "Specialized Hunting and Gathering Societies," (pp. 
148-186) begins with references to climate change and to a modern 
revision of opinions concerning culture change. There is an increased 
hesitancy to attribute culture change in Africa, as in other parts of 
the world, to invasions and a greater preference to see diffusion of 
concepts and techniques rather than population movements. 

It considers the origins of current African peoples, including the 
apparant first entrance of the ancestors of the Pygmies into the 
forest some twenty thousand years ago.

   In the Sahara and south of it the geographical distribution of the 
   African races, with the exception of that of the Bantu-speaking    
   peoples, is beginning to show as a very ancient stretching some    
   ten thousand years or more into the past -- the large and small    
   bush type, the Negro and the Afro-Mediterranean stock were all     
   present in much the same places as they are found today, though,   
   of course, with some, their present-day distribution does not      
   accurately reflect the former extent of their dispersal. pp. 168-169

The author mentions the mosaic of cultures evident in the Nile Valley 
where drying conditions drove peoples. He refers to cereal grasses, 
fish and sea foods, the prevalent use of the bow and arrow and 
throwing stick in the rock art, from 5,000 BCE forward and considers 
various later Stone Age regions, reminding the reader than bone is 
not much preserved in Equatorial and West African moist forests. He 
then considers the rock art of Tanzania, Rhodesia, South and South 
West Africa fully developed some two thousand years ago.

   The pigment was obtained from grinding various kinds of mineral    
   rock -- haematite, manganese, kaolin -- and mixing the powder with 
   some fatty or resinous medium. It was sometimes stored in little   
   horn containers and was applied with the aid of a feather brush or 
   a wooden or bone spatula. p. 183

Chapter VI, "Farmers and Present-Day People" (pp. 187-223), considers 
the development of agriculture originally in Western Asia and by 
about 5,000 BCE in Africa. It refers briefly to the emergence of the 
ancient Egyptian Civilization, comparing pharaonic rule to that of 
later rulers in the Upper Nile and West Africa. He proceeds to 
discuss the spread of agriculture to Cyrenaica and other places. This 
leads to a consideration of the rock paintings and engravings in the 
Sahara, Cyrenaica, Upper Egypt and Nubia. Also, the question is 
raised as to why agriculture seems to appear two thousand years later 
in West Africa.

   The habitat already provided an inexhaustible supply of meat and   
   plant food -- more than was necessary for the needs of the         
   communities living there. There was, therefore, no particular      
   incentive at first to change to raising crops and animals,         
   especially since Neolithic equipment cannot have been particularly 
   advantageous in an environment of high rainfall, hardwood forests  
   and rapid regeneration. The chief reason, however, is likely to    
   have been because the crops grown in Egypt and north Africa were   
   winter-rainfall crops which are unsatisfactory under tropical      
   summer-rainfall conditions. p. 202

He mentions recent revision of earlier opinions concerning the 
introduction of yam to Africa c. 500 BCE and suggests that local yam 
(Dioscorea cayenensis) and oil palm could have supported a relatively 
large West African population. He refers also to extensive forest 
clearing in the Congo and Lake Victoria basins.

   In northeast Angola, the clogging of the stream courses with sand  
   washed in from the sides of the valleys is not associated with any 
   known climatic fluctuation and is believed to reflect the result   
   of soil erosion following clearing of the woodland and forest for  
   cultivation that began in the first millennium BC It certainly now 
   begins to look as if the first Millennium BC was the time when     
   cultivators began to attack the Equatorial forests. p. 206

There is reference to the influence of the tsetse fly, retreating 
from the drying Sahara after 2,500 BCE and trade routes suggested by 
chariots on rock art. There is mention of Afro-Mediterraneans in the 
Kenyan highlands until the mid 16th CCE and of the expansion of Bantu 
speakers.

   Recent linguistic work indicates that Bantu and Negro languages    
   shared a common homeland in the eastern part of west Africa in the 
   region of Chad and Cameroun and, further, that there was a nuclear 
   centre where 'Proto-Bantu' was spoken, in the southern part of the 
   Congo basin. From here the language spread in most directions at   
   different times. p. 211

This leads to the topic of metallurgy and iron. He refers to the Nok 
culture in northern Nigeria using iron by 500 BCE and the spread of 
iron to various parts of the continent and characteristic cultures 
such as the Monamatapa-Zimbabwe.

   The history of this state typifies the general pattern of that of  
   other Bantu-speaking kingdoms in central Africa. Ititially, it was 
   a strong and vigorous central authority, no doubt established and  
   held together by the personalities of its rulers who maintained    
   control of rich economic resources distributed by networks of      
   local and lond-distance trade routes. The ultimate destruction and 
   disappearance of the state followed weakening of the central power 
   through a series of ineffectual rulers and the facility with which 
   the provincial tribal authorities were then able to make           
   themselves autonomous in a tropical environment where no proper    
   communications system existed. p. 221

The author concludes by mentioning the importance of awareness of the 
past and the significance of a growing realization that Africa, 
likely the original home of humans, was the scene of a more dynamic 
and engaged activity than some previously may have thought.

This is an interesting introduction to a complex and very lengthy 
chapter of human pre-history. It is very much worth the read.
