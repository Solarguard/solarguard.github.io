This review is now followed by notes on the novel. These are mostly

BROTHER TO SHADOWS, Avon, 1999 (1993).

This is one of the more recently written of the High Galactic
Civilization stories. It introduces the foundling Jofre who has been
raised as a kind of samurai warrior. He is an offworlder to the
largely planet focused culture of Asborgan. His unusual features
combined with his Master recognized talent do not endear him to his
fellows in the order. On the Master's demise he is expelled from the
order. There is also an attempt to strike him down.

However, not only does he survive, he finds a rare artefact, one of
sanctity and of power. He further soon becomes involved in the
affairs of an offworlder, a relatively young Zacathan, one who is
working on a time scanner, a device enabling observation of the past.

There is a glimpse of three other planets: the crossroads world of
Wayright, the dictatorship of Tssek and the wild frontier orb of
Lochan. One other main character graces the novel. She is the
heroine Taynad. She is also from Asborgan. Indeed, she is a sister
in a companion martial arts order to that of Jofre's past. She is,
however, entrusted with a binding command and it takes her a while
to realize that some binding commands are not to be followed.

There's a good look at the bodyguard's exposure to political events
beyond his awareness, and even of the confidence shaking
susceptibility of the human body to advanced technological weapons
unknown on less industrialized Asborgan. There's a front row seat
view of the end of a dictatorship, as the long-suffering people of
Tssek rise up and throw off the yoke of the tyrant. There's the
spectacular presentation of the consequences of a working time
scanner, especially when this is focused on a vital historical
moment and on a Forerunner archaeological site.

All in all, Brother to Shadows is a very good companion piece to 
many other fine tales of Norton's High Galactic Civilization.
