<center>CELTIC HERITAGE</center><p>

Alwyn Rees and Brinley Rees, Thames & Hudson, London, 1961<p>

After thanking such as Georges Dumezil and Proinsias MacCana for reading this in 
pre-publication form, the authors proceed to depict the traditional Irish 
storytelling tradition: its oral nature, the sacred context of its hearthfire, 
its timing during winter and darkness, the previously privileged position of the 
storyteller and poet, the wider IE and even broader background of, "Prose 
interspersed with speech poems" (p. 16), etc.<p>
 
They proceed in the second chapter to outline the four cycles of Irish tales 
(Mythological, Ulster, Fenian and Historical), mentioning the five pre-Milessian 
groups of immigrants to Ireland, concentrating on the "Peoples of the Goddess 
Danann" (p. 28), a magical people bringing four talismans: the king pronouncing 
stone, Lugh's ever-victorious spear, the unavoidable sword of Nuadu and the 
hunger conquering cauldron of the Dagda.<p>

They mention the Christian embarrassment at talking about pagan gods, name some 
of the deities, outline the story of the Second Battle of Mag Tuired, including 
quoting that famous exchange between the doorkeeper at Tara and multi-talented 
Lugh.<p>

Next they turn to the Welsh MABINOGION: "The First and Third Branches about the 
family of Pwyll, Lord of Dyfed, the Second Branch about the family of Llyr, and 
the Fourth Branch about the family of Don." (p. 41)<p>

They treat then the Ulster Cycle, raising glimpses of "The Story of the Pig of 
Mac Datho", "The Feast of Bricriu", "The Cattle-Raid of Cuailnge," and the 
Fenian Cycle, quoting the qualifications for membership in the warrior band, 
including mastery of the dozen poetical books, contrasting these two cycles as 
heroic (Ulster) and romantic (Fenian).<p>
 
They advance then into the Welsh Arthurian tales and then the Irish Historical 
cycle, mentioning Niall's kiss of the old hag who is the Sovereignty of Ireland 
and the wider concept of the king married to the land.<p>
 
The second part of the book begins with the concept of darkness and light, that 
duality dividing day and year, states the significance of the thresholds of 
sunrise, sunset, Samhain, Beltaine, as well as, in Wales, Midsummer's Eve, goes 
on to speak of the four divisions of the day and adds the names Lugnasad and 
Imbolc to quarter the year.<p>

Chapter IV is titled "Coming Into Existence" and starts with the statement, 
"Celtic tradition has preserved no native story of the creation of the world 
and of man." (p. 95) They outline the story of the coming of the Milessians to 
Ireland, quoting on pages 98-99 Amairgen's song which begins, "I am Wind on 
Sea." They mention the importance of precedent in traditional societies and 
how the LEBOR GABALA records firsts. Mention is also made of Dumezil's 
tripartite division of IE society, extending this to four and then five.<p>

This thought continues in Chapter V, which begins by raising the issue of the 
fifths of Ireland, in one categorization (p.123): Learning (Connacht), Battle 
(Ulster), Prosperity (Leinster), Music (Munster), and Kingship (Meath). 
Considerations of these correlations continue through Chapter Six, with, of 
course, the caution that these are meant symbolically and naturally the 
inhabitants of a particular fifth are not all warriors, musicians, etc. Chapter 
VII continues such numerological speculation, mentioning the importance of not 
only five, but also of nine, even in China, and including 12 and 13. Chapter 
VIII turns to Wales divided into three parts and Chapter IX, "Numbers," includes 
the five (with the extra forfeda) fives of the ogham.<p>

Part Three, "The Meaning of the Story", is a fascinating distillation and 
exploration of those categories of tales most connected with the mythic life 
cycle: births, youthful exploits, wooings, elopements, adventures, voyages and 
deaths.<p>

Among its interesting points: the wrongness (e.g. illegitimacy, through 
adultery, etc.) of the hero's birth, the marriage of a craftsperson to the 
craft, the designation of an Irish bridal procession as, "Dragging home the 
bride" (p. 268), the likeness of Beltaine ceremonies to the spring festivals 
of the Great Mother, humans often being called on to resolves disputes in the 
other world, the prevalence of truth in the supernatural realm, the list of 33 
islands in the immram of Maelduin, that the voyage tales, "Preserved the 
tattered remnants of an oral Celtic 'book' of the dead" (p. 325), comparable to 
the BARDO THODOL, "The violation of gessa," as, "a sure omen of approaching 
death" (p. 327), and heroic deaths, including Cu Chulainn's, at Samhain.<p>

The epilogue mentions the importance of, "The thin line between opposites," 
"mazes," "the point" where "three or more independent entities...coincide", 
"puns", "metaphors," and "riddles" (pp 345-9).<p>
   
Overall a fascinating book and well worth the read.<p>
