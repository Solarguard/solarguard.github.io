<center>Nine Virtues</center><p>    

I. Piety<p>

Ogham, patron, wellspring of wisdom, eloquence and courage! Epona,
guardian, protectress and shield! Niall, Mil and all my other ancestors!<p>

"Conabar!" I have tried throughout my life to honour them worthily who
are so worthy of honour.<p>

I have tried to honour all my Catholic ancestors by attending mass
regularly, by praying daily, by observing the form of that religion and
endeavouring to live according to its highest spirit.<p>

I have tried to honour the Dawnbreakers and all their spiritual
descendants by regularly attending Feasts, by keeping the Fast, by
striving to be a living example of the letter and the spirit of Baha'i
law.<p>
 
I have tried to honour, am trying to honour and vow in future to try
to honour the spirits of my ancestors, the spirits of the land in which
I dwell, the great shining ones high above, by observing the 8 High Holy
Days of the modern pagan calendar, especially the four I have marked for
decades because they are Irish, by communion at the Tree Ring, by
calling on and thanking Epona on departing and returning hither each
time I journey outside the door of my home, by keeping faith in every
way I can to the best of my ability.<p>

From the simplest of offerings I gave in respect, in hope, in prayer,
through the great events and reverential projects of my life to the full
offering of my essence, self and being, I'll try to honour you.
"Conabar, Conor, Conabor." I have tried, I am trying, I shall try.<p>

2. Integrity<p>

Honour to those who conveyed to me the Ten Commandments, especially
the Seventh and Eighth. Honour to the Enlightened One who uttered,
"Right Speech." Honour to the Blessed Beauty who endowed the word,
"Trustworthiness," with such creative potency. Honour to all my
ancestors, to the spirit of the Tree Ring, to guardian Epona and all
inspiring me to ride in the direction of this virtue.<p>

Grateful am I to them all that throughout the years various
supervisors of mine have said that I am reliable, that working on my own
caring for the tropical plants at Tunny's Pasture, that the sole person
working in a store, that as a treasurer handling money and issuing
charitable tax receipts, I gave no cause for complaints. Honour to them
all that when I left the Canadian Civil Service in 1988, I had several
months of unused sick leave.<p>

Honour to them that I seek to honour my word, that often when asked to
take on a task late in the day I have replied, "I am too tired now to
visualize myself doing this, and I try not to commit myself to what I
cannot see myself doing; ask me in the morning and it will be more
likely that I will agree to take on this committment."<p>

Honour to them for the word which has served for decades as my motto,
"Conabar," I have tried.<p>

3. Fertility<p>

Thank you, Mummy, you whose life was too short, that you gave me
birth, nurtured me and, with your primary school education, instilled in
me study habits that have stayed with me all my life.<p>

Thank you, Andre Norton, Lord Dunsany, Clark Ashton Smith and so many
others for your example and for the sowing of your words, your thoughts,
your visions. My stories, my poems and the power of my non-fiction prose
is one of your harvests.<p>

Thank you, Brigid, for, among many other things, filling me with the
energy to attempt the ADF Dedicants Program. Please continue to bless me
with the showers of your favours that I will follow it through to the
end. Help me to focus my talants, my energy, my time on what is most
worthy, necessary, pleasing.<p>

Thank you, Oghma, patron deity of our house, that I so long resigned
to die single did marry and now have children who will continue the
cycle of the generations. I thank all the spirits and deities concerned
that I who stayed at home with them, shared so much with them in their
youngest years. And, thank you, Oghma, for answering my ritual request
and giving me such vitality for the enormous task of uncovering, sharing
and preserving the memory of so many on our family tree. Please continue
to help me in this, in all my future endeavours for the acquisition and
sharing of knowledge, through all the days to come in which my pen, my
voice, my keyboard have the opportunity to engender what may worthily
persist when the atoms of this physical form have fertilized the earth.<p>

4. Hospitality<p>

Honour to my great-grandfather, Patrick McKenna, for the example of
his hospitality and enlightened religious tolerance. He welcomed the
Protestants travelling across the Catholic territory in which he dwelt.
He welcomed them so hospitably that when he died, a century ago,
Protestants came into the Catholic church for his funeral.<p>

Honour to all my ancestors, to all the spirits of the land, to all
the great high shining ones for their influence on me in striving to
grow ever more hospitable.<p>

In 1974 one of my room mates explained, "Michael has two kinds of
eating, the normal way and breaking bread."<p>

I give thanks to those who have helped me to strive to demonstrate
hospitality, whether I was staying at a hostel for untouchables in India
(Yes, I know the caste system was abolished, but it seemed real enough
when I was there) or a guest at the home of the leading SF writer in
Ukraine. And I was grateful for all the beneficial influences on me
trying to manifest this virtue as I welcomed into my home professors,
scientists, writers, farmers, cemetery workers, travellers from each
Continent of this planet.<p>

Until my last breath may I continue to break bread, to be a pleasant
guest, to be a worthy host, to accept the gift of the awesome diversity
of the human species with the reciprocal gift of pleasant appreciation
of this richness of humanity and to endeavour to contribute ever more
fully to the happiness of those who visit me and of those whom I visit.<p>

5. Moderation<p>

Oghma, the Wise, Oghma, the Source of eloquence, Oghma, patron,
continue to encourage me to aim for the Middle Path, the Golden Mean,
the harmonious balance between extremes.<p>

It is a normal human tendency to wander from the high way of virtue
into the ditch on either side. Great Oghma, please, every time I stumble
so, grant me the perception to realize where I have come, the
understanding as to how I am to climb back out again and the will,
determination and energy to make the effort.<p>

Let me distinguish between what is normal, healthy and beneficial
focus of attention and what is obsession. Let me adorn my conscious and
unconscious awareness, in every aspect of my being, with what is neither
void, nor "busy", in a heraldic sense, but appropriately aligned.<p>

Let me not accept unconsidered the standards and judgements common to
this generation. Let me add to the scales the views and values of the
honoured dead and try to visualize how the Paleo-Pagans would be trying
to live honourably in a high tech society.<p>

Grant me the knowledge, wisdom and resolve to live in physical
harmony, to treat healthily, reverently and usefully the divine gift of
nature which is my body.<p>

Let me live in mental balance, to arrange in moderation what is
growing healthily, honourably and usefully in the orchard of my mind.<p>

Let me live in spiritual harmony, internal and external, striving
ever to rise higher in the Tree of Pagan spirituality.<p>

6. Wisdom<p>

As Oghma, my patron, is considered, among other things, a god of
wisdom, it may be appropriate to say more words about this virtue,
accepting that these extra words do not render it intrinsically superior
to the other virtues.<p>

One aspect of wisdom is that awareness that greater attention, focus
and concentration do not have to correspond to greater value. I honour
my direct ancestors by painstaking genealogical research, by rejoicing
that I walk a Celtic path, by studious research on the 
Proto-Indo-Europeans and I greatly value the principle of the spiritual
equality of all human beings, including those not closely related to me,
not treading a Celtic path, not as interested in or influenced by PIE as
am I.<p>

Another aspect of wisdom is the acceptance of human limitation. I
accept that my thoughts, even when quite forcefully expressed in the
flowing eloquence Oghma inspires, cannot ascend beyond finite reality.
By his favour, I strive to be open-minded, allowing my understanding to
grow with the passage of time and the attainment of more complete
information. From this follows the awareness of the validity of a vast
variety of views. There is the Buddhist parable of the blind men
attempting to perceive an elephant and each correctly, but incompletely,
feeling it as snake-like, wall-like, pillar-like, etc.<p>

Wisdom includes accepting the multi-faceted nature of the jewel of
truth. And, wisdom includes following a personal path, rejoicing if
others happen along.<p>

An aspect of the pagan wisdom of my ancestors was considering divine
words too sacred to commit to writing. It is a fruit of wisdom to have
no sacred text that the literal minded may impose on others. This is
confirmed by the history of monotheism and the human sacrifices there to
such literalism. Those words which have been written down may most
wisely be read in an open-minded and tolerant spirit, accepting the fact
of the wide variety of human perceptions without feeling threatened,
without responding by defending or by attacking.<p>

Another aspect of pagan wisdom is the acceptance of the imperfection
of our deities. Again, this deep wisdom receives validation from human
history and the tragedies caused by the thought Deity is perfect. More
humans were sacrificed to this belief than were ever burned in any
Wicker Men.<p>

It is possible, it is wise to honour those so worthy of honour
without demanding of them absolute perfection. And, if this may be done
in relations divine, there is no dishonour in applying it to the human
realm. One may lead and one may honour leaders without insisting that
leadership corresponds to perfection.<p>

Such considerations of perfection and imperfection extend to the
issue of unicity. Philosophers and theologians have proceeded from the
premise of perfection to insist on one absolute divine being. The
polytheistic focus of ADF not only resonates to my personal belief
system, to my own sense of spirituality and to that of many others (how
else do we explain the numerous saints reverenced in religions insisting
on a single deity?) but also is wise at many levels, including the
promotion of tolerance and the magical efficacy of calling on a divine
specialist in time of need. This latter point is not negated by the
wider functions of Celtic deities contrasted to those of some other
pantheons. Even many skilled Lugh has never been mentioned to me as one
to call on while diving or in labour. And, if any choose to do so, that
is fine by me. And, let them respect my choice to call on the deities I
do when I do.<p>

7. Vision<p>

Great Brigid, Mother of Dreams, Vision and Prophecy, please nurture
me to strive to see more clearly, to perceive ever more discerningly, to
live ever more in tune with your insight.<p>

Inspire me to continue to heed my dreams, drink from your chalice of
divination, abide in the centre of the Tree Ring, deepening my
realization of the harmony of life (root, trunk, leaves; the ancestors,
the spirits of the lands, the great high Shining Ones above; past,
present, future...)<p>

Alert me to dangers and opportunities. Advise me as to which areas
of my life require greater personal attention. Inspire me to know, to
realize, to act according to the higher interests of the intricate form
that is myself, of the complex inter-relationships in which I
participate, of the awesome mosaic which is the great global garden of
life, being, nature.<p>

I am deeply grateful that you allowed me, provided me, inspired me
to study, to work with, to use the ancient, sacred, energizing ogham.
May "My Little Ogham Book" continue to be very much a part of my life.<p>

May the words, the visions, the influence of the mystics continue to
cause my spirit to vibrate beneficially. Let the seed of the sight of
the Good guide me along my path aware that evil, as poverty, darkness
and cold, defines what isn't and wealth, light, warmth and virtue are
what exist.<p>

Brigid, permit me, encourage me, enthuse me to gaze at the verdant
leaves, to hearken to the trillings of the birds, to inhale the
fragrances of the blossoms, to feel the solid trunk, to taste the fruit.<p>

8. Perseverence<p>

A complement to bold and decisive action is the slow steady growth,
as a tree, persevering, continually striving, patiently reaching towards
potential.<p>

Thusly, is a new language learned. Thusly, for example, the spirit of
Cicero, even in English, captivated my impetuous Irish heart, and across
the years this student persisted in the goal of reading such a writer in
the Latin original. I moved from town to town. All the acquaintances,
sights, circumstances of my everyday life flickered, altered, changed
and still I studied Latin.<p>

And the harvest of that perseverence is incalculable. It is not only
an influence on the spelling, grammar and style of my English. It is not
simply a greater awareness of the currents of life in Late Republican
Rome. It is not "merely" an ability to enjoy others, such as Q. Horatius
Flaccus in the purity of their maternal language.<p>

When I saw the scholars flamed, would I have been so quick to see the
difference between ad hominem and ad rem, without this Classical
background? When I saw the choice between censorship, patriarchy, enmity
and the freedom of expression, the equality of gender, harmony would I
have been so daring as to disagree so openly and effectively with the
Universal House of Justice? Would I have had that persistence that led
to historical consequences, including those "infallible" words that one
could be, "Fearless, honest and articulate" without being eligible for
membership in the Cause of God, to which I made that so startling
response that I am pagan?<p>

Honoured spirits of my ancestors, honoured spirits of the land, great
lofty shining ones high above, please help me to grow as is best, to
perceive the more worthy way to go, to try, to endeavour, to persevere
towards the noble goal. Help me also to understand clearly when the
virtue of perseverence is called for and when it is time to balance it
with one one of, or more than one of, the other virtues.<p>

9. Courage<p>

<center>Valour's Value</center><p>

A. Text<p>

<blockquote>A Spartan hurls, "Then, fight will we in shade."<br>
     A lone Arab attacks to join Hussayn.<br>
     A swordsman strikes, "And you at home remain."<br>
     An "Evil" Lord allows his realm to fade.<p>

     A scholar speaks, "Honour heaven's mandate."<br>
     Renouncing all Siddhartha's princely aim.<br>
     Acquiring heathen ways a priestly fame.<br>
     Valour's value transcends a martial fate.</blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
                                    Michael McKenny Imbolc 2000 CE
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>

B. Commentary<p>

The allusions are elucidated briefly in section C.<p> 

Among other things, this is a poem of balancing views. The Confucian
activism of Han Yu meets Buddhist renunciation of the world. The great
defence of Europe at Thermopylae is harmonized by Matteo Ricci's embrace
of Chinese culture. The irrevocable division of Islam meets its counter-
point in the birth of an unorthodox universalist movement. Outstanding
military prowess is reinforced by noteworthy pacific acts of courage.<p>

Valour resides in all cultures, peoples and times. It surpasses
restricted stereotypes concerning conflict, armed and unarmed. Accepting
the validity of the vastly varied views of others and overcoming
hostility itself are among the highest expressions of this virtue.<p>

C. Elucidations<p>

Line 1. (Greece 480 B.C.E.) The Spartan reply when threatened at Thermopylae
that the arrows of the Persian host would blot out the sun.<p>

Line 2. (Iraq 680 C.E.) One man arriving to find Hussayn, grandson of
Muhammad, and his companions dead attacked the army that had killed
them.<p>

Line 3. (Iran 1840s C.E.) Mulla Hussayn, scattering by sword an attacking
force, rode through the fleeing foe to the residence of their leader and
called out, "He who proclaims a 'Holy War' should be leading the troops;
what are you doing at home?"<p>

Line 4. (USSR late 20th c. C.E.) In an act possibly unprecedented in human
history, Mikhail Gorbachev refrained from opposing by force the
disappearance of his empire.<p>

Line 5. (China 822 C.E.) Han Yu, most outstanding author of the T'ang
Dynasty, secured by persuasive words that obedience of a rebellious
governor the imperial army had failed to achieve.<p>

Line 6. (India 6th c. B.C.E.) Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, overcame the
life into which he was born to inspire one of the most significant
spiritual movements in human history.<p>

Line 7. (China 16th c. C.E.) The Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci achieved
exceptional regard for his impressive facility with Chinese language,
literature and culture.<p>
