There follows a brief outline of the concluding volume of Dorothy
Sayers' translation of Dante's Divine Comedy. Since she died before
completing it, Barbara Reynolds has translated almost all of what comes
after canto twenty. Barbara Reynolds has also provided the extensive
notes, etc. ancillary to the translation proper.

It is intended to enhance the inadequate outline below. This and the
outlines of the other two volumes are placed here as a beginning to the
Dante subsection that will, touch wood, be on Solarguard before the end
of 2008. During this year, the outlines themselves will be rendered
more worthy. Other material will be added.

Dante, the Divine Comedy 3 Paradise, transl. Dorothy Sayers and Barbara
Reynolds, Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1962

I Seeing Beatrice gaze at the sun, Dante looks up. He rises with her

relatives intent on dynastic marriages. Dante asks do they not want to
rise higher and is told divine will is acceptable.

a lack of contrary assertive will.
