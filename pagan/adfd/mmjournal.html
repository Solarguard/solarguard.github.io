Green's Journal

This is an attempted reconstruction of the file sent in September
2000 to ADF. This file began from the beginning of a new volume of
my journal which describes right from the start my receipt of the
notice from ADF I am a member and the dedicants material. This is
being typed on July 5, 2003 from longhand. Some material has been
omitted, as noted, and it is likely this closely replicates the
original file:

12/3/99 c. 05:35
   This is the Spiritual Diary of Michael McKenny whose spiritual
name is Green. On March 10, 1999 I received notice from A Druid
Fellowship that I was a member, my application having been accepted
as of February 8, 1999. On March 11, 1999 I bought this journal as
well as one of the books on the recommended list in the Dedicant
material of ADF.
   I, Green, take oath of Oghma, Epona, Lugh, Brigid, the Daghda
and the other gods, goddesses and spirits of my people to faithfully
record in this journal on a daily basis, as much as possible, my
spiritual efforts sincerely to acquire the knowledge of the pagan
path I follow, to will to demonstrate the best of the nine noble
virtues of which I am capable and to live as honourably as I may the
pagan life indeed.
   The nine noble virtues as I have learned them from ADF are:
Wisdom, Piety, Vision, Courage, Integrity, Perseverence,
Hospitality, Moderation and Fertility.
c. 06:40 I have just returned from the Tree Ring where I was
energized revitalized filled with the potential to accomplish all
that will be done today (list of goals omitted).

13/3/99 06:40 
   I have returned from the Tree Ring, having asked the protection
of Epona on setting out, while away and after I return. The birds,
the great crows, the cheerful song birds, the numerous pigeons at
the early morn and the otherwise stillness, spirit and awe of this
time enthused my being. I sang prayers, blessings and well-wishes.
   It is my intent, will and volition to live this day, tomorrow and
every day more, increasingly, perfectingly in accord with the nine
noble Celtic virtues: Wisdom, Piety, Integrity, Perseverence,
Vision, Courage, Moderation, Hospitality, Fertility.

14/3/99 c. 08:45
   Today I hope to avoid the Internet or at least TRB. Yesterday
Sylvie Charbonneau loaned me THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CELTIC WISDOM.
Today exercise, balanced diet, pagan brunch, study of both new
books, ADF, clean house, clean self, study of ogham and Irish
language, continued transformation of self.

15/3/99 06:30
   I have returned from the Tree Ring. It was so calm and relaxing.
Today I hope to clean the shrine of my body, mind and physical
abode, to work on meeting my obligations, including the pagan class
I am to give Wednesday; to continue to plan the celebration for
Oghma's Day on March 30th; to find out the details for the Rit
Saturday and tell this to Michael Demers; to subscribe to the local
ADF list, to contemplate the distinction between the virtues of
wisdom and vision; to continue breath exercises; to become more
aware of Celtic deities.
   After I wrote this I lay down relaxed, calmed my mind, breathing
fully and slowly. This led to thoughts of Oghma and his festival. I
think we will give each other the gift of stories. I will try to
think more on this throughout the day.

16/3/99 c. 06:30
   I have returned from the Tree Ring. It was calm, relaxed, serene,
and I felt energy. I called the gods, goddesses and spirits,
expressed in triads my well-wishing to the Tree Ring, to all the
trees of the great forest and to all within the great forest. I
asked blessings, bestowals and favours to cleanse, sanctify and make
holy body, mind and soul, the house in which I dwell, the society in
which I abide.

17/3/99 c. 06:25
   I have returned from the Tree Ring. While I have called on the
gods, goddesses and spirits of each of the directions I made special
pleas to Oghma on this special day requiring wisdom, both as it is
the tenth birthday of my son Kevin and as this evening I am to give
the talk at the pagan class at the University of Ottawa.
   This morning at the Tree Ring I was especially aware of crows.
Checking in Miranda Green's DICTIONARY OF CELTIC MYTH AND LEGEND I
see she mentions the war goddesses Macha, Badbh and the Morrigan as
being associated with crows. I also looked under raven and saw that
there are associations with various other deities, including Lugh
and Epona, protectress of our family.

18/3/99 c. 06:25
   This morning seemed even more relaxing and energizing than normal
at the Tree Ring. I left here about 20 to 6 and returned just now. I
asked that I continue along my pagan path, that I become more
conscious, aware and perceptive of the gods, goddesses and spirits
Irish, Celtic and blessing, favouring, bestowing good upon the trees
of the Tree Ring, all the trees of the great forest, all beneath the
trees of the great forest, upon my body, mind and soul, upon self,
family and clan.

19/3/99 c. 06:20
   I have returned from the Tree Ring relaxed and energized to meet
the day and continue the cleaning of the temple in which I dwell and
the continuing construction of the shrine to the worship of the
gods, goddesses and spirits of the Irish people.

20/3/99
   It is 06:40. I have been to the Tree Ring. I am poised on the
threshold of a day special, blessed and filled with special
accomplishment. Yesterday I continued to purify this abode. I
studied a bit of Irish and read some of THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CELTIC
WISDOM by Caitlin and John Matthews. This contains source material,
starting with the GABALA. It has spirit.
   (the description of the equinox ritual is included in the file on
rituals I attended, mmrits.txt).

22/3/99 c. 07:00
   Last night between 8 and 9 I went to the Tree Ring. It had
already begun to snow about 5 o'clock. As the temperature is close
to zero, I sent special good wishes and called on the gods,
goddesses and spirits to ensure the well-being of the trees of the
Tree Ring, of all the trees in this great forest and of all beneath
the trees of this great forest.
   I have been considering enhancing the aspect of the home shrine.
This will outline the existing situation reaching back more than a
year. (There follows here and under the first paragraph of 24/3 what
is essentially the same material as that forming the file on the
home shrine paghfane.txt).

24/3/99 c. 06:45
   This morning I woke up, wrote down my dream or what I could
remember of it, went to the bathroom, then came and lay down and
briefly tried breathing exercises. I have been doing breathing
exercises when I had time or thought about it. I have also stilled
my mind, an ability I have always had.
   (Five more paragraphs essentially included in the file on the 
home shrine paghfane.txt).

26/3/99 06:15
   This morning I woke up at 5 o'clock, went to the bathroom, got
dressed and went to the Tree Ring. It was especially good. I felt in
tune with the spirits. I felt more at ease with the fact I have
arrived in the forest of home. My path may have led me through
mountain and desert, but now this Celt is in the forest. I asked the
gods, goddesses and spirits that I be wholesome, healthy and vital
in body, mind and soul.
   I continue to cleanse this house, to read GLAMOURY and PHOENIX
FROM THE FLAME bought on March 22, 1999, to try to get onto the ADF
e-list. I sent a message to adf-office where I got Ian Corrigan who
told me to contact adf-tech where I got someone named Robert
(Henderson?) who told me to try Listmaster, Jan, I believe, and I
hope soon to hear back from her. I have asked to join the dedicants
list.

27/3/99 06:25
   I have just returned from the Tree Ring. I sang or chanted a 
ritual for health, that I choose well how I eat and rest and exercise
this day. I was stirred at dawn by the sound of the crow. I see the
crow as a messenger of Epona. I have had a cold or something.
Yesterday I felt very tired and sluggish at times. This was
intensified as I was unable to take a nap at the normal time because
the children were home. Little work got done as well...(omitting
descriptions of children at home and going to a resaurant when we
arrived to find the David Suzuki exhibit full).
   Today I hope, intend and pray to eat, rest and exercise
healthily, wholesomely and beneficially, to continue tidying,
cleansing and sanctifying the temple in which I dwell, to
participate, if possible, on the adf-dedicants list. I will read and
study and meditate, gods willing. I will also plan the celebration
of Oghma's Day.

30/3/99
   It is about 20:00 hours. The full moon is high in the sky. Last
night I went and stood in one of the lines of moonlight shining
through the Tree Ring and gazing through the Tree Ring up at the
moon communed intimately with the moon, with the spirits of the
land, with the ancestral spirits and with the gods and goddesses. I
called on Dian Cecht for physical health and offered a gift for a
gift to do with this health what will best honour the gods and help
in the remembering of them.
   This morning right after I woke up I did my meditation. I find
that lying on my back after I've just woken up, so that I don't just
fall asleep, is a very effective position.

6/4/99
   Spring has been very vitalizing, invigorating. A lot has got
done: (omitting some mundane stuff) meditation, dreams, visits to
the Tree Ring, reading and studying, major cleaning up projects...

8/4/99
   Tonight I had a tremendously successful time at the Tree Ring.
Throughout the afternoon I felt mind-clouded. This continued into
the evening. So, I went to the Tree Ring and did a wonderful ritual,
raising energy, blessing the trees, honouring the gods, goddesses,
spirits, calming, cleansing and energizing my mind, body and soul.
I sang. I said, "Ever together, never apart"! The beneficial,
wholesome and healthy spirit of the Tree Ring is with me, as is my
spirit with the Tree Ring beneficially, wholesomely and healthily.
There was a great sense of identity, and beneficience, wholesomeness
and health.

9/4/99
   I went at dawn to the Tree Ring and briefly urged the spirit of
the Tree Ring, all the other beneficial gods, goddeses and spirits
that I be healthy wholesome and well today, tomorrow, etc.
   It is now 21:30. I have decided to try harder to stick to a
schedule in studying Irish. This leads me to the following as
general schedule goals: (basically visit Tree Ring at dawn, study
Irish, meditate, read a book from the ADF reading list and plan
specific tasks).

12/4/99
   c. 18:00 I have studied some Irish. (details of planned Irish
study)

14/4/99
   c. 10:00 I went again at dawn to the Tree Ring. (Irish study)

18/4/99
   c. 14:00 I've not long ago posted to the ADF-dedicants list in a
reply to a comment from Omega Sygal-Moon about water being included
with earth and air in the Two Powers attunement. I wrote:
Greetings Omega Sygal-Moon,
   Many thanks for your comments. It's actually quite fascinating to
see how these things are perceived by different individuals.
Personally, I think of myself as being on land, indeed, in the midst
of the great forest.
   There are a lot of people around, but there remain trees, one
reason the ice storm last year was felt so hard.
   In the house, I'm doing a lot on controlling breath and on
stilling the mind. The two powers is something I've experienced
largely outside, except for the Ostara Rit, my first experience of
an ADF ritual. Actually, I see things in the context of trees. If
someone says fit earth and air into it, then I still see a tree, or
the Tree Ring where I often go.
   I agree with you. For me, including water makes sense. Triads are
such a Celtic thing. And, this feels so natural for me in a
meditative state. Root, trunk, leaves. I can associate with these
what feels appropriate for me. It is water comes up the roots from
under the ground, so, water, the past influences, the ancestral
spirits, the unconscious, etc. Earth, the present, the spirits of
the land, the trunk of the tree, current consciousness. Air, future,
the greater spirits, goddesses and gods, imagination and plans for
the foliage and fruit to come. This is the image that comes to my
mind when I try to focus on the two powers attunement.

mmrits.txt)

1/5/99 (There's a desciption here of the OPN, Ottawa Pagan Network,
ritual I attended).

4/5/99
   c. 14:30. There have been some wonderful visits to the Tree Ring
at dawn lately. Today I sent an e-mail message to Alexei Kondratiev
asking him to correct the little bit of Irish I wrote for the tree
honouring ceremony. He kindly did so. He said:
   Tugaimid ono/ir do Dhe/ithe na
   srutha/na, da/r sinsear, don talamh, don Bhile
   don fha/inne crann
   Ta/ oi/che Bhealtaine ann.
   Maireann rince na se/asu/r gan deireadh

5/5/99
   Taken from the ADF-Dedicants e-list from a week or two back:
Here's a script for a full trance vision of the Triads of Druid
cosmology. (this is written out by hand for the next four pages)

7/5/99
   c. 20:45. I am not at all satisfied with my work on meditation.
It has been very hot for a week, and I have had some trouble
sleeping. I have begun over again from the beginning with basic
breathing exercises and held this for only a couple of minutes
focusing on the beat, but then the mind started up.
   I have been going to the Tree Ring every day at first light and I
am calm and relaxed there, though I stopped doing formal breathing
exercises or paying attention there to the stilling of the mind.
I'll try to start that up again at least inside.
   (references to internet activity, including me posting a review
of THE PHOENIX AND THE FLAME, to my attending the pagan class at the
University of Ottawa and waking up to see it raining at last).

9/5/99 06:30
   I have just returned from the Tree Ring. It was magnificent out.
It rained and everything thrives, my very favourite time. I continue
my meditations.

13/5/99 14:45
   Last night 3 of us: Ian, Michael Demers and myself met at the
Tree Ring and then went to Grab a Java at Bank and Fifth. We talked
about getting the grove organized. We are also tentatively scheduled
to drive to Montreal a week from today for the regular liturgical
meeting there.
   I have continued to go to the Tree Ring around 5:30 or so every
morning. The peace and calm and serenity of that spot at that time
continues with me throughout the day. I have been feeling great for
days. May that long continue.

14/5/99 c. 21:30
   This morning after eating breakfast I felt ill. Normal routine
has been that I wait till I'm alone and then eat. Since I've been
going to the Tree Ring at dawn, that'll be several hours after I
wake up before I eat. Today I just felt zonked either from the fish
not being good, a bug or whatever. (delete reference to children's
homework and a paragraph on future projects and details of a friend
calling to say had I been riding with him last night as planned I'd
have been in a car accident with him.)

28/5/99 11:25
   I went to the Tree Ring. The moon was close to full and there
seemed to be a ring of light around it. I stood in that awesome spot
looking at the full moon through the Tree Ring. I chanted to the
goddesses, gods and spirits of ancestors/roots/underworld, of
trunk/middle earth's rivers, lakes, lands and of canopy of
leaves/shining ones/sky. I sent greetings and well wishes and I
called for my continuing along my path of Irish paganism.
   (mundane material omitted).

30/6/99 (description of Midsummer Ritual in mmrits.txt)

22/6/99
   A HISTORY OF PAGAN EUROPE arrived today. I owe Arlington Books
23.54 US for the book.

27/6/99
   Chapter 2 of the above. (notes on this chapter omitted)

9/7/99 c. 21:30
   Yesterday I bought CELTIC TREE MYSTERIES by Steve Blamires and
read much of it. I called Danny (this is my brother, a carpenter,
living in the home where we grew up) and asked if he could cut 20
coins from a piece of wood I had brought back from Dow's Lake. This
was from the Poplar tree across the path from the Tree Ring. At the
ADF liturgical meeting on Wednesday night, we went to the Tree Ring
to ground and afterwards went back and Ian selected or carried the
large branch from that tree on the other side of the path (it had
been knocked down in a storm recently) to serve as Lugh's spear in
our Lughnasad rit.
   Danny's response was to come over here this morning, look at the
piece of wood (mine, not the huge Lugh's spear), say he couldn't do
the job with such poor wood, but he'd keep his eyes open when he was
up at the Lake (Wolf Lake, Quebec). To my surprise my father came
over around 7 or 8 this evening and dropped off 26 discs. He told me
Danny had found a piece of elm at 40 Oval.
   These discs look very good to me. I spent more than an hour
handling them one by one, placing them in a pattern so I know which
strokes will go on which disc. I wrote yesterday the 20 ogham
letters in a little notebook I have. I also wrote there the names of
these letters in the Latin alphabet in Irish and English, and also a
brief divinatory description based on what I've read on the net and
on what I've read in Steve Blamire's book.
   This evening as I held each disc I recited its name in both
languages, and also the divinatory description from that notebook.
   I began the period of time spent with those discs with a prayer
to Oghma.

15/7/99 c. 14:00
   On Saturday, the 10th, I walked over to Staples, thinking I would
buy some coloured markers, but decided there to buy coloured
pencils. I came home and on that day I carefully drew the symbols on
the discs Danny, my brother, had prepared for me. I had asked his
aid as a consequence of my longstanding belief that Oghma is a
special patron of our family.
   I have continued to read Steve Blamire's CELTIC TREE MYSTERIES,
to look at and handle the ogham discs and to read, recite and
memorize what I have written about each charater in my little ogham
notebook which I have titled "My Little Ogham Book."
   Tuesday night while walking at Dow's Lake Park I saw a birch
tree. I walked up to it, touched its bark and, gently, its leaves,
greeted it and wished it well, and I recired from memory what is in
"My Little Ogham Book" on the birch.
   (more mundane material omitted)

17/7/99 07:30
   I wrote the other seven stanzas of that Irish poem later on
Thursday the 15th, being aided by placing the ogham disc coll/hazel
on the paper as I wrote. I have continued my work with ogham. I have
been seeking Thorsson's BOOK OF OGAM which seems to be out of print
and not in the Ottawa Pagan Library.

20/7/99 c. 21:00
   I have just done my first personal ogham divination. I put the
ogham discs inside a green shirt (I took it off to do this) shook
them and pulled out 3 discs one by one having them go up from the
bottom. First was ailm, second was onn, third was huath. My reading
of these is to take the long view, look with perception, consider
well how I fit into the pattern of life past, present and to come;
devote a lot of attention to obtaining, gathering and collecting
what I need material, mental and spiritual for my life as a Celt, an
Irishman, a druid; cleanse myself of all the debris of the past,
physical, mental and spiritual putting into my life the growth from
the middle disc.

29/7/99
   I have been going to the Tree Ring almost every day. On Tuesday
the 27th I bought a second hand copy of THE NEW OXFORD BOOK OF IRISH
VERSE. This is translated by Thomas Kinsella and I consider him a
true poet. The English versions I've read are good. That poem about
adze head coming was quite a find.
