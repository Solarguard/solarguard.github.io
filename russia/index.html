Russia, the CIS and Eastern Europe, is a vast area of great interest to Michael McKenny who did some keen study in high school, took Russian language and history in university, corresponded intensively with SF fans in the XUSSR when openness arrived in the late 80s, translated Russian SF and Fantasy for publication in English, and was one of the two first Westerners to attend the Ukranian national SF convention in Kiev in 1992. At present this site offers:
a synopsis of WAR AND PEACE and of Robert Massie's mammoth biography of Peter the Great, reviews of a number of Russian SF books, of a fascinating account of Russian naval activity in the Pacific up to 1825, of a biography of the early academic G.F. Muller and the report of the 1992 Ukranian National SF Convention, as well as a review of Crisan's work on Early Romanian history, Burebista and His Time. This was last updated on December 25, 2008 C.E. with the addition of Michael McKenny's summary of Vincent Cronin's "Catherine Empress of All the Russias.<p>
