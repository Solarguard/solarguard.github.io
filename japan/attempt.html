<h2>JAPAN: AN ATTEMPT AT INTERPRETATION</h2>

Lafcadio Hearn, Charles E. Tuttle, Tokyo, 1969 (1904)

<p>For one, as I, very interested in the traditional ways of my Celtic
ancestors, this rhythmic, sensitive, perceptive account of a people
travelling Shinto (The Way of the Gods) in deep respect of their
ancestors is very absorbing.

<blockquote>The real religion of Japan, the religion still professed in one form
   or other, by the entire nation, is that cult which has been the
   foundation of all civilized religion, and of all civilized society,
   -- Ancestor worship...The three forms of the Shinto worship of
   ancestors are the Domestic Cult, the Communal Cult, and the State
   Cult, -- or, in other words, the worship of family ancestors, the
   worship of clan or tribal ancestors, and the worship of imperial
   ancestors. pp. 21-22<p>

   The domestic cult proper may not have been established until about
   the eighth century, when the spirit-tablet is supposed to have been
   introduced from China. p. 24</blockquote>

<p>Originally, there was concept neither of heaven, nor of hell. We
understand the ancestors are present, here and now.

<blockquote>By death they have acquired mysterious force; -- they have become
   "superior ones," Kami, gods. p. 27</blockquote>

<p>They rely on us for regular reverence; they bestow favours. This
reciprocal relationship is vital.

<blockquote>The history of Japan is really the history of her religion. No single
   fact in this connection is more significant than the fact that the
   ancient Japanese term for government -- matsuri-goto -- signifies
   liberally "matters of worship." p. 32<p> 

   Every spring an imperial messenger presents at the tomb of the
   Emperor Jimmu, the same offerings of birds and fish and seaweed, rice
   and rice-wine, which were made to the spirit of the Founder of the
   Empire twenty-five hundred years ago. p. 37</blockquote>

<p>In a shrine (mitamaya, august spirit dwelling), in an inner room, on a
shelf (Mitama-San-no-tana, Shelf of the august spirits) reside five or
six spirit tablets.

<blockquote>Only grandparents and parents and the recently dead being thus
   represented; but the name of remoter ancestors are inscribed upon
   scrolls, which are kept in the Butsudan or the mitamaya. p. 43</blockquote>

<p>The Butsudan is the mitamaya of the Buddhist.

<p>To the Life Givers each morn and eve is given sincerest thanks and a
little food.

<blockquote>Unseen they guard the home, and watch over the welfare of its
   inmates: they hover nightly in the glow of the shrine lamp; and the
   stirring of its flame is the motion of them. p. 45</blockquote>

<p>Reincarnation is a Buddhist contribution to Japanese belief. The
ancestral cult continues in the male line. One could divorce a barren
wife or add to her a concubine. One could pass over an unworthy heir.
One could adopt, even a husband for a brotherless daughter. One could
not remain celibate. 

<p>Though time splits households, all continue to worship the common
ancestor of the family, the uji-no-kami or ujigami. As time cycles, the
aged relinquish authority to the eldest son, and daughters-in-law are
welcomed into their new families.

<blockquote>The funeral ceremonies performed upon her departure from the parental
   roof, -- the solemn sweeping out of the house-rooms, the lighting of
   the death-fire before the gate, -- are significant of this religious
   separation. p. 67</blockquote>

<p>She comes to the parents of the groom, to their spirit-tablets, if they
are already ancestors. Although in theory the paterfamilias had enormous
power, in practise this was generally used reasonably, in the interests
of the family. Servants were treated as family dependants in
relationships extending through generations.

<p>The ujigami, the god of the patriarchal family, of the gens, is the god
of the community, "Clan-deities" "Worshipped as clan-ancestors." This
word "Ujigami" is also used of, "Shinto parish temples." p.83 The
parishiner, "Ujiko," is brought to the Ujigami, "Thirty-one days after
birth if a boy, or thirty-three days after birth if a girl." p.85 He or
she is, "Placed under the protection of the god," p. 85 and the baby's
name is recorded. Thereafter, this place attractive to children is the
joyous scene of feast days and festivals, games, candies and toys. If
one must leave the district one comes here to say good-bye.

<p>On returning to one's native place after prolonged absence, the first
visit is to the god...I have more than once been touched by the
spectacle of soldiers at prayer before lonesome little temples in
country places -- soldiers but just returned from Korea, China, or
Formosa: their first thought on reaching home was to utter their thanks
to the god of their childhood, whom they believed to have guarded them
in the hour of battle and the season of pestilence." pp. 85-86

<blockquote>The office of the Shinto priest, or 'god-master' (kannushi) was, and
   still is hereditary. p. 86</blockquote>

<p>Prayers at important times are to the ujigami and communal custom is
very important. Violations may cause very severe consequences, including
banishment in a nation where one required permission to become a
Buddhist monk or even to spend a night away from home. One means of
control, of guaranteeing communal co-operation, was the annual religious
procession, during which should the portable shrine of the Ujigami, 

<blockquote>A weighty structure borne by thirty or forty men...whithersoever his
   divine spirit directs them...strike against any home, -- even against
   an awning only, -- that is a sign that the god is not pleased with
   the dwellers of that house. pp. 102-104</blockquote>

<p>It may happen that the god decides to really teach them a lesson. He
will  then be carried in through the walls and the place trashed,
because the residents offended against the community.

<p>Many, innumerable are the traditional gods. The imperial cult,

<blockquote>The worship of the goddess of the sun, from whom the supreme ruler
   claimed descent...first gave to the people a written language of
   traditional beliefs...The oldest is entitled KO-JI-KI, or "Records of
   Ancient Matters"; and it is supposed to have been compiled in the
   year 712 A.D. The other and much larger work is called NIHONGI,
   "Chronicle of Nihon [Japan]," and dates from about 720 A.D. pp.
   109-110</blockquote> 

<p>Among the legends is the poignant story of Izanagi seeking his beloved
in the realm of the dead. His right eye is the moon; the sun is his left
eye. All Japanese, at least all, "Samurai, farmers, artisans and
merchants" are descended from gods. The son-in-law of the Sun Goddess is
the lord of the Dead, "And he rules over all of the Ujigami." p. 122
While there are more than 195,000 Shinto shrines, ideally there is a
pilgrimmage once in a lifetime to Ise, noted for being,

<blockquote>Rebuilt every twenty years, -- the timber of the demolished
   structures being then cut into tablets ["Charms"] for distribution
   throughout the country. p. 124</blockquote>

<p>There are gods of guilds and work is worship.

<blockquote>For example, the carpenter still builds according to Shinto
   tradition: dons a priestly costume at a certain stage of the work,
   performs rites, and chants invocations, and places the new house
   under the protection of the gods. p. 125</blockquote>

<p>There are temples dedicated to more than one god, to, "Different spirits
of the same god," p. 126 to great historical personages.

<blockquote>The spirit of Sugiwara-no-Michizane, once minister to the Emperor
   Daigo, is worshipped as the god of calligraphy, under the name of
   Tenjin or Temmagu: children everywhere offer to him the first
   examples of their handwriting, and deposit in recepticles, placed
   before his shrine, their worn-out writing brushes. p. 127</blockquote>

<p>Despite the multitude of Shinto gods of nature, of home, of craft, of
historical figures and ancestors, 

<blockquote>We find the roads under the protection of Buddhist deities chiefly.
   p. 130</blockquote>

<p>Also, responding to Chinese concept is, "The Ki-Mon or Demon-Gate," p.
130 protecting gardens on the north side, whence all evil is deemed to
come.

<p>Cyclical ritual cleanliness included daily prayers and ablutions,

<blockquote>Nine great national holidays...the universal practise of daily
   bathing ...the o-harai...performed twice every year, -- in the sixth
   month and the twelfth month by the ancient calendar...the erection of
   special houses for birth...the consummation of marriage...the dead.
   pp. 137-146</blockquote>

<p>Also,

<blockquote>Women were obliged during the period of menstration, as well as
   during the time of confinement, to live apart. p. 146</blockquote>   

<p>While various methods of divination were employed:

<blockquote>By bones, by birds, by rice, by barley-gruel, by footprints, by rods
   planted in the ground, and by listening in public ways to the speech
   of people passing by, p. 151

   <p>The earliest form of official divination was performed by scorching
   the shoulder-blade of a deer, or other animal, and observing the
   cracks produced by the heat. Tortoise-shells were afterwards used for
   the same purpose. p. 151</blockquote>

<p>The most minute details of life and expense were regulated, according to
caste and financial level.

<blockquote>When a man's life was legally ordered, -- even to the quality of his
   foot-gear and head-gear, the cost of his wife's hairpins, and the
   price of his child's doll, -- one could hardly suppose that freedom
   of speech would have been tolerated. p. 170</blockquote>

<p>Very intricate grew speech and even gesture in response to compulsion
that rudeness be avoided.

<blockquote>Of terms corresponding to 'you' or 'thou' there are still sixteen in
   use; but formerly there were many more...the rules of the verb, above
   all, were complicated by the exigencies of etiquette to a degree of
   which no idea can be given in any brief statement. pp. 171-172</blockquote>

<p>Buddhism entered the land and became established because it accepted the
traditional ancestor-worship, which it had already encountered in all
the countries where Buddhism existed.

<blockquote>Intolerance of ancestor-worship would have long ago resulted in the
   extinction of Buddhism. pp. 183-184</blockquote>

<p>Buddhism enhanced traditional beliefs, identifying the gods with Buddhas
and Bodhisattvas, depicting artistically the consequences of gaining
merit, extending broadly education. Buddhist philosophy, above the
consideration of common folk, by quite different premises, reached some
conclusions not so remote from some modern Western thinking.

<p>At the apex of Japanese society shone the Mikado.

<blockquote>The Kobetsu ("Imperial Branch") represented the so-called imperial
   families, claiming descent from the Sun-goddess; the Shinbetsu
   ("Divine Branch") were clans claiming descent from other deities,
   territorial or celestial; the Bambetsu ("Foreign Branch") represented
   the mass of the people. p. 235</blockquote>

<p>In addition there were castes (sei), eight of them from the time of the
Emperor Temmu. Many were those, "Bound to a place...family...or estate."
p. 231

<blockquote>Slaves were tatooed...had no family names...shaved the greater part
   of the head, and wore queues. pp. 232-233</blockquote>

<p>There were also various outcasts, eta and hinin.

<p>Lafcadio Hearn thinks accounts about times from Emperor Jimmu (r.
660-585 B.C.E.) until Empress Suiko (593-628 C.E.) highly unreliable.
She fostered influences from China. Soon the Fujiwara clan produced
regents, ruling for emperors, encouraged to become monks at a young age,
their successors being even younger. After a great naval victory, the
Minamoto clan assumed the regency, or shogunate. They were replaced by
the Hojo whose prayers raised the typhoon which destroyed the invading
Mongol fleet. The Hojo fell in 1333. Now rose the Ashikaga.

<blockquote>The Ashikaga gave the country fifteen rulers, several of whom were
   men of great ability: they tried to encourage industry; they
   cultivated literature and the arts; but they could not give peace. p.
   273</blockquote>

<p>In 1573, Oda Nobunaga seized power without the title of shogun. He moved
against militant Buddhist monks, attacking monastery fortresses. He
attempted to quell the incessant conflict of warring clans, a goal
temporarily achieved by his successor Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi turned his
eyes outward and his dying wish was to bring the troops home from Korea.
Next, in 1508, came the great Tokugawa who ended the war in Korea,
crushed opposition at home and forged a relatively high degree of
internal cohesion. One issue he handled was his declaring illegal
junshi, suicide on the death of one's lord. Hearn relates the tale of
the 47 Ronins, who in 1703 presented their dead lord with the head of
his enemy and then joined him in death.

<p>Another issue Tokugawa handled was Christianity. Many Westerners may
have heard of Japanese converts to Christianity and of their
persecution. This author augments awareness of this historical episode:

<blockquote>But the furious intolerance of the Jesuits in the southern provinces
   had already made them many enemies, eager to avenge the cruelties of
   the new creed. We read in the histories of the missions about
   converted daimyo burning thousands of Buddhist temples, destroying
   countless works of art, and slaughtering Buddhist priests; -- and we
   find the Jesuit writers praising these crusades as evidence of holy
   zeal. p. 306</blockquote> 

<p>Tokugawa Iyeyasu, humane and politic, investigated, including by
conversations with the English born samurai, Will Adams, the
consequences of Catholicism in other lands. 

<blockquote>Iyeyasu must have heard...the story of the Spanish conquest in
   America, and the extermination of the West Indian races; the story of
   the persecutions in the Netherlands, and of the work of the
   Inquisition elsewhere; the story of the attempt of Philip II to
   conquer England... p. 312</blockquote>

<p>The impact of this religion on Japan he realized.

<blockquote>Yet this religion, for which thousands vainly died, had brought to
   Japan nothing but evil: disorders, persecutions, revolts, political
   troubles, and war. p. 328</blockquote>

<p>He ordered it extirpated.

<p>The Tokugawa Shogunate lasted until 1867. Life was regulated in detail,
and there was unprecedented peace and security. It was a time of art,
even popular art, and of study.

<blockquote>This was the age of popular fiction, of cheap books, of popular
   drama, of storytelling for young and old. p. 357</blockquote>

<p>And it was an age of scholarship. Mitsukuni, a grandson of Iyeyasu,

<blockquote>Compiled, with the aid of various scholars, the first important
   history of Japan, -- the DAI-NIHON-SHI, in 240 books. p. 370

   <p>There gradually developed a new school of men-of-letters: men who
   turned away from Chinese literature to the study of the Japanese
   classics. They reedited the ancient poetry and chronicles; they
   republished the sacred records, with ample commentaries. They
   produced whole libraries of works upon religious, historical, and
   philological subjects; they made grammars and dictionaries; they
   wrote treatises on the art of poetry, on popular errors, on the
   nature of the gods, on government, on the manners and customs of
   ancient days..."</blockquote>

<p>This scholarship led to an increased awareness of the position of the
Emperor. During the upheaval created by Perry, the shogunate was
abolished. Drawing on traditional strengths, Japan, in an amazingly
brief time became the equal of the modern powers.

<p>Modernization continues through support of traditional ways, especially
ancestor worship, officially supported even to the extent that the state
will provide an heir to an aged heirless one unable to adopt.
Traditional communal pressures remain, though time may weaken them.

<blockquote>Any comprehension of the history of Japanese politics during the last
   fifteen years is not possible without some knowledge of clan-history.
   p. 389</blockquote>

<p>Communal spirit continues to supersede Western notions of the advantages
of competition. Education encourages co-operation among pupils, eager to
meet their obligation to study.

<blockquote>And the strange courage of persistence in periods of earthquake and
   conflagration, when boys and girls used the tiles of their ruined
   homes for school-slates, and bits of fallen plaster for pencils. p.
   417

   <p>That a large part of the private income of their Imperial Majesties
   has, for many years, been devoted to public education is well known;
   but that every person of rank or wealth or high position educates
   students at his private expense, is not generally known. p. 435</blockquote>

<p>This includes teachers, at all levels, who sacrificially see to the
education of their pupils and students.

<p>There are further pages on the accomplishments and the prospects of the
Japan of 1904. The underlying theme is the vital strength of ancestor
worship. As a whole, this book has been a fascinating read for one, as
I, so interested in honouring my ancestors, in seeking a path of
religious tolerance, in seeking to understand and to feel the common
humanity of people everywhere. 

<p>The author of this still valuable consideration of traditional Shinto
was born in 1850 in Greece of Irish and Greek parents. He studied in
France and England, travelled to America at the age of nineteen, where
he wrote for newspapers. At the age of forty he moved to Japan, where he
married. He died in 1904, the year this book was written.<p>
