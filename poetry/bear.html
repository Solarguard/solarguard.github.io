PATRICIA AND THE BEAR

A tale of the Pontiac,
Where we're on a list waiting.
"We've just," says the maniac,
"Two cages for bear baiting."

At last they come conveying
A cage to a dog's abode.
The bait's been long decaying.
The bear disdains this commode.

Better the trash recently
Placed in a neighbour's laneway.
There the bear eats frequently.
"The cage's cost you'll repay."

The guy from the government
Complains their cage is bearless,
Resents the bears discernment,
Would charge for being careless.

To the local depanneur,
Erin goes on an errand.
Unaware what's derrier,
She and Chad the path descend.

A call with news worrying.
"The bear's at the path's entrance."
Patricia's sent hurrying,
While a friend phones quite intense.

"Please tell Erin McKenny
And Chad down there to remain."
"They've bought their stuff already.
They're on their way back again."

Now instantly reacting,
Patricia rushes outside,
A ruler stick extracting.
Little use will it provide.

Right to it she encroaches,
To just within two meters.
"Move it! Shoo!" she reproaches.
You know of young and mothers.

The beast is not minuscule.
More than two hundred kilos.
See the creature ridicule
David as dirt it bestows.

Growling as if furious,
Dirt hurling, stepping forward.
Howling as an impetus,
That they go with one accord.

David's for his vehicle,
Patricia to the neighbour,
With pleas, tidings volatile,
"Come with a bat for succour."

"It will make me masticate
My puny bat de baseball.
My car I will navigate
Indigestion to forestall."

With timing not premature
Two cars at the bear converge,
Causing a quick departure,
As Erin and Chad emerge.

You've my respect fraternal,
Patricia, for your courage.
And please hold your funeral,
As late as you can manage.
