WORLD OF THE MAYA, Victor W. Von Hagen, Mentor, New York, 1960

The author begins his first section "Background" (pp. 11-36) with a
brief survey of archaeological interest in the Maya. He describes
the geography. He mentions the early period, including the Mamon
culture, the rise of cities in the Classical Period and their
abandonment, the arrival of the Toltecs, the building of Uxmal,
seafaring, contact with the Arawaks of Cuba and Jamaica and civil
strife.

Part Two, "The People" (pp. 37-111), begins by considering the
hierarchical nature of the theocratic Mayan society.

   The common men were maize farmers. When war was upon them they
   were soldiers, acting as an agrarian militia. Their labor erected
   the soaring temples. They built the immense ball courts and
   terraces. They felled the trees, dressed and then transported the
   limestone blocks, carved the glyphs, and sculptured the Maya art.
   They built the raised causeways, the sacbeob, that bound city to
   city. p. 37

He describes clothing of men and women and such practices as
tatooing, body painting and men wearing mirrors in their hair. He
looks at the language, the city-state structure, class, family farm
lots of four hundred square feet, a score of farmers helping each
other, matchmakers, monogamy, residing with and working five years
for the bride's father, houses and the course of an ordinary day:

   The women rose first, between 3 and 4 AM, rousing the flames from
   the smouldering ash in the koben, the three stone hearth; if a
   household had a slave, he or she carried out this task. p. 53

   When the Maya farmer departed in the early dawn for the fields,
   he took with him several apple-sized balls of ground maize
   wrapped in leaves. Steeped in water and flavored with burning-hot
   chili peppers, these became his lunch, to which he added perhaps
   a piece of dried venison. p. 54

   The farmer returned early in the afternoon. The women, by custom,
   had a hot bath ready for him. In the large centers such as Tikel
   and Chichen Itza, there were communal steam baths. p. 54


   The evening meal was the only elaborate one of the day. p. 54


   Then, in Yucatan, he sat in semidarkness and worked wood, jade or
   cotton into articles of trade, or made weapons. p. 56

He also describes women spinning, pine splinters lighting the dark,
pregnant women travelling twenty miles by canoe to Ixchel's (goddess
of pregnancy) island shrine and names:

   Each Maya had four names: (1) the given name, paal kaba; (2) a
   patronymic; (3) a combination of his mother's and his father's
   family names, naal kaba; and, like people everywhere, a nickname,
   (4) coco kaba. Names were magical; a name could be worn out by
   excessive public use. 58

He continues with patrilineal inheritance, the coming of age
ceremony, hospitality, the awareness of the spiritual nature of all
things, the heroic concept of women dying in childbirth, the
importance of maize, other crops, agricultural techniques, taxes,
corvee, weaving, featherworking, basketweaving, pottery, trade,
marketplace, and festivals. New Year came in July.

   It was the time for renewal. They put on new clothes, destroyed
   their old pottery and fiber mats. There was a sense of new
   direction. It was a solemn occasion. p. 92

Various festivals with music, dance and merry-making came throughout
the year. In the tenth month (of eighteen) animals taken by hunting
were honoured and antlers, jawbones and wings displayed in homes.

   To the Maya all animals possessed soul force, and when they were
   killed the hunter had to show them respect. If this was not done,
   other animals of the same species as the one insulted would not
   allow themselves to be killed. p. 93

He discusses the importance of drumming, dancing, music and games,
including the popular ball game played in courts. He considers
concepts of justice, including criminals paying back victims. He
looks at health and healing, death and afterlife:

   Those who kept the rituals, that is, "the good," went to a place
   shaded by "the first tree of the world," and drank their fill of
   cacao under it. p. 110

Part Three, "The Ruling Classes" (pp. 112-139), looks at the
privileged. It describes concepts of physical beauty and adornment.
It mentions hereditary office, the previously dominant perception
that the Maya had not cities but temple and ceremonial structures
and a more recent view that they did have urban sites. It refers to
the noble house, merchants, Mayapan the capital and the revolt about
1450 that ended it. The author proceeds with a look at warfare, the
two warleaders, the various weapons, the problem of supply in the
absence of beasts of burden, the preference for surprise attacks,
elite units, the sacrifice of eminent captives. He considers Mayan
religion: its pervasive nature, the multiple aspects of each deity,
priestly schools and sacrifices.

Part Four, "The Achievements" (pp. 140-212), considers the
accomplishments of the Maya: the pyramids still standing, temples,
scuptures, painting, mathematics, astronomy, calendar, sea travel
and literacy. It closes with an account of the fall in 1697 of the
last Mayan stronghold.

This is a sympathetic introduction to the topic well worth the read.
