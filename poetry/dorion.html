<PRE> 

Sing the song of Dorion, Elfin king,
Who lived far away and so long ago.
Ah, the wonder of Elfland's golden glow,
When our world was young with wonder reigning.

The sun of the dawn tide of the world shone
Upon the splendous kingdom of Faerie.
Only minstrels remember the glory
Of the country of the first leprechaun.

The green shamrochs blooming in wild away,
The magic singing of cool forest streams,
The dragonflies soaring like divine dreams
While green serpents slideth whither they may.

There came a minstrel to the elvish court
From the sunset, from the lands of the blest,
Bringing curious lays out of the west,
Of a strange and never before heard sort.

He rapt the king with his enchanting tales
Of the marvels Sun gazed upon at night,
And hurries back each day for further sight,
How they linger for one who westward sails.

So rose the heart of Dorion the Brave,
As his fair eyes turned from Faerie of old,
Gazing past her gleaming towers of gold,
Following songs across the western wave.

I'll sail in an elfin ship at sunset.
I'll sail speedily across the western sea
To see what the sun sees when gone from me.
I'll meet the marvels that there may be met.

Up lept the first leprechaun of Erin.
"I prithee nay," he shouted in dismay,
"Else I fear fair Faerie has had its day
And the days of darkness shall soon begin."

"Recallest thou not none sailing thither
Homeward ventured from that western voyage.
How then canst a king pass without the age.
Stay, lest it chance our changeless land falter.

Yet none could gainsay the king of Elfland.
His galley pranced before the westward breeze,
Swimming speedily through the azure seas,
While a leprechaun wept upon the strand.

Michael McKenny c. April 15, 1974.
