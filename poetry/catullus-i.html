<H3>Catullus I</H3>

To whom do I give my nice little book,<BR>
Newly furnished with the most modern look?<BR>
To you, Cornelius, who seem to feel<BR>
My fanciful trifles mean something real?<BR>
The sole Italian who bravely unrolls<BR>
The whole of time from his three studied scrolls.<BR>
Have it. It's yours though it be all the rage.<BR>
And may the Muse let it outlive the age.
