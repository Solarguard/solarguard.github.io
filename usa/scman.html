Science in the Cause of Man, Gerard Piel, Alfred A. Knopf, New York
1961

On September 13, 2008, while on my way to a Chinese/English language
exchange, I came upon a garage sale. There I found this book. One of
the impressive data to input into the assembly of information, its
analysis and, hopefully, beneficial use, is the very great extent to
which previous generations have possessed essential knowledge.

A basic question formulates itself: how can destructive patterns of
thought that throughout human history have prevailed against the
perception, insight, and awareness of the wisest people be cured in
the ascent of humanity to species sentience? A supplementary one is:
once healed, how can humans retain health, avoiding the re-emergence of
attitudes and behaviour that into the Twenty First Century are savaging
them?

This book by a former publisher of Scientific American and one of the
contributors to the Science of Science reviewed elsewhere in this
Solarguard subsection, emerges from the context of the concepts under-
lying the Cold War. The very men who had provided the tools for species
suicide realized the imperative necessity of employing human knowledge
for the benefit of, rather than for the harm of, humanity.

This book offers the analyst some nineteen articles. I hope by the end
of the year to summarize these, adding whatever personal understandings
are the harvest of their stimulating influence.

I.1 "Science and Secrecy" (3-20): US censors burned three thousand
copies of the April 1950 issue of Scientific American insisting on a
censored version. Censors prohibit prominent scientists from saying
what is already in the public domain. "Science and secrecy are a pair
of opposites." P. 6

   The advances in the physical sciences which now make the hydrogen
   bomb possible contrast powerfully with our laggard understanding in
   the social sciences p. 15

   One thing we do know for sure about this mysterious process is that
   its decisive catylist is the truth. Hence our abhorrence of secrecy
   and censorship. In the words of Lord Acton: "Everything secret
   degenerates, even in the administration of justice; nothing is safe
   that does not show how it can bear discussion and publicity." p. 15

   In our dealings with other government agencies, we do not recognize
   a press handout as an ultimate reference for anything but the policy
   of the agency that issues it. And we are always mindful that a press
   handout is important for what it leaves out as well as for what it
   contains. p. 18

Excessive secrecy concerning nuclear energy is institutional and highly
problematic.

I.2 "How Do We Make Our Alumni Publications Appeal to the Intellects of
Our Alumni" (21-40) delivered at John Hopkins July 1953: These could
more effectively cover teaching and learning, reaching across divides
separating scientific journals into specific fields.

I.3 "Scientists and Other Citizens" (29-40): Prominent scientists
hounded by McCarthy and the Un-American Activities Committee have been
elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science. Spending on science, mostly for military purposes, has much
increased producing projects, teams, loss of independence. Demagogues
currently issue charges essentially of heresy and association. The
appropriate response is not denial of the charges, but of the validity
of issuing them.

I.4 "The Planet Earth" (41-60): Earth accommodates humanity, as all
life, upon it. Human transmission of knowledge advances succeeding
generations. Science is global, contrary to current nationalist
policies: resources diverted to weaponeering, scientists from
universities to industrial and governmental labs, secrecy stifling
publication, travel restrictions impeding personal contact.

   The International Geophysical Year suggest that men can increase
   their understanding of the earth only by investigation of the planet
   as a whole. Such investigation today requires intellectional
   collaboration of a high order. But the collaboration is
   international only because men have divided the earth into their
   separate and transitory worlds. The earth itself remains one planet
   and the only one the next few generations of men are likely to know.
   p. 50

A minority of humanity lives well, the majority badly; the planet has
the resources to support all well. UN agencies: WHO, FAO, UNESCO, have
significantly addressed the requirements of the deprived. Rather than
curtailing its support for such agencies, the US ought to increase its
committment to what will likely be a major endeavour of the last half
of the century.

   The $4 billion public works budgets of the New Deal have been
   succeeded by the $40 billion arms budgets of the cold war. p. 59

   We have, perhaps, an even more pressing question: whether war or the
   expectation of war provides a dependable foundation upon which to
   rest our economic prosperity. p. 59

II "Science in America" Intro (63-64): Here are the five lectures I
delivered at the University of Chicago in 1955-56. Eisenhower warned
against "the military-industrial complex" and a "scientific-
technological elite." (p. 63) Open science at Pugwash inspired a 
nuclear arms control agreement; "intellectual condotierri" (p. 64)
impede its implementation. Hopefully the new Science Advisory Committee
and the new president (Kennedy) can realize arms control and allow
humanity's peaceful advance.

II.1 "The Social Compact" (65-79): America has scientific awareness,
replacing superstition with technological experience. Nineteenth
Century America applied scientific advances made in Europe. In the
Twentieth Century, especially with the arrival of prominent scientists
fleeing totalitarian regimes, American universities added significant
research to their teaching focus.

Current military preoccupations neglect basic science. Public support
is logical, but average comprehension of science is decreasing. Society
alters; farmers become factory and office workers. Democratic control
of our modern, monolithic economy is an essential challenge.

II.2 "Founding Fathers as Social Scientists" (80-96): American founding
fathers, including Benjamin Franklin, anticipated scientific advances.
Their view of American democracy was scientific. They established
American freedom, which demands the determined attention of succeeding
generations.

America's early colleges focused on teaching, not research. Charles
Eliot at Harvard began the transition. Initially expected to teach what
was confortable, schlars began to seek truth.

   The demonstrable and accumulative success of science showed that the
   test of truth could no longer be whether it was agreeable or
   orthodox, but whether it was supported by evidence. The test of the
   scholar was to be his competence, not his opinions or associations.
   p. 86

Growing conformity accepting erosion of freedom, including presumption
of innocence, marks current reality. Tolerance of the expression of
erroneous ideas is an essential aspect of the realization of truth.

II.3 "Our Industrial Culture" (97-112): America's advantage is the
scale of its industrial activity. In 1940 some seventy per cent (240
million dollars) of research funding came from industry, twenty per
cent (70 million) from government and only about ten per cent (35
million) from endowments, etc. Now, the numbers are industry a billion,
government two billion and ninety million other. Money has strings. The
focus of industrial and government spending tends to be projects, not
individuals, applied science and engineering, not pure scientific
research.

II.4 "Security and Heresy" (113-133): The atom bomb was developed with
the help of some people considered security risks. Groves, the guy in
charge, took the risk of hiring them. The 1947 loyalty decree restricts
such hiring. Oppenheimer's situation is examined in some detail,
including the point that holding strong opinions, including against the
bomb, is not un-American. It is important that government have access
to such opinions.

II.5 "The New Paradise" (134-151): Developing nuclear weapons is not
science. The military secrecy enveloping the decision to use the atomic
bomb and to pursue the hydrogen bomb is not in the national interest.

   Meanwhile, we are just at the beginning of the dehumanization and
   decerebration of our society... p. 143

Einstein said that scientists have developed the tools allowing
unscrupulous politicians to chain scientific freedom, though scientists
can choose even destruction over slavery. Bertrand Russell addresses
the issue of national loyalty.

   Bertrand Russell writes: "This matter of loyalty is the crux.
   Hitherto, in the East and West alike, most scientists, like most
   other people, have felt that loyalty to their own state is
   paramount. They no longer have a right to feel this. Loyalty to the
   human race must take its place... I do not wish to be thought to
   suggest treachery, since that is only a transference of loyalty to
   another national state. I am suggesting a very different thing: that
   scientists the world over should join in enlightening mankind as to
   the perils of a great war and in devising methods for its
   prevention." pp. 146-7

The Einstein Russell Manifesto is discussed and in part quoted:

   We are speaking on this occasion, not as members of this or that
   nation, continent or creed, but as human beings, members of the
   species man, whose continued existence is in doubt... There lies
   before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge
   and wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death because we cannot forget
   our quarrels? We appeal as human beings to human beings: remember
   your humanity and forget the rest.

An aspect of current reality is humanity's present ability to provide
for all humans. As slavery only recently has become intolerable, so
continued deprivation exists only until humanity's ethics matches its
present technological level.

III.1 "Secrets of Nature" presented to the Moss Committee March 1956
(pp. 155-167): Semantics erroneously suggest security equals secrecy,
supporting what is "repugnant to our traditions." p. 156 Nature's
secrets open, and cannot be concealed from, competent science.
Simultaneity is the stuff of science's history. Examples are provided
of this. of cross fertilization and of delays caused by commercial
secrecy.

   It is an old experience in the administration of our country that
   secrecy can be a shield for incompetence and corruption. p. 166

   Under our Constitution, Congress is not empowered to abridge
   communication; it is forbidden to abridge communication. But there
   is nothing in the Constitution that says Congress cannot promote
   communication. p. 166

He recommends funding translations of foreign language journals.

III.2 "Science, Censorship, and the Public Interest" presented to the
1956 convention of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science" (168-177): Scientific communication, facilitated internally by
technical writers and to the public by science writers, is threatened
by a current culture of secrecy, inimical to our way of life.

The First Ammendment ordered disclosure of information. Government has
increasingly done the opposite. The first Congressional investigation
into such secrecy is the Moss Commission. Science especially is
impacted by enthusiastic censors lacking competence to de-classify what
they stamp.

III.3 "Sputniks in the Sky" to the Women's City Club New York City Dec
1957 (178-192): Sputnik was a human achievement heralding a lunar
observatory, interplanetary and even interstellar exploration. Russia
has a long scientific tradition and deep respect for the scientist. The
author praises an asserted individualistic American approach to science
over Soviet team work. The Soviet Union now has free decent universal
education. American education can be improved not only with more
science learning, but learning more broadly.

III.4 "Science, Disarmament, and Peace" (pp. 193-200):

   Science is in the public domain and belongs to all of the people in
   the world. It is only in our troubled times that we have learned to
   speak of American science, or German or Russian science. Whatever
   these jingoistic phrases are intended to suggest, they are a
   contradiction in terms. p. 195

   But now let us settle this anxiety about science. I venture to
   declare that the further advance of science can add little to
   mankind's already well-secured capacity to destroy itself. It is
   difficult to see how we can improve on the ultimate. p. 195

Technological improvements may remain. More concern arises from the
extent of the militarization of our society. Science now permits global
peace and freedom.

III.5 "The Revolution in Man's Labor" April 1959 Annapolis, Maryland:
(201-216): We stand on the verge of species suicide. To assert
humanity's violent nature ignores humanity's adaptability. Forceful
acquisition of scarce resources loses meaning in an age of science
providing abundance. Long ago the agricultural revolution enabled four
families to support four plus one. The four were enslaved. Over the
past four centuries inductive reasoning increasingly accelerated
scientific understanding, providing the means to eliminate planetary
want. To prevent starvation, the industrialized segment of humanity can
invest in developing lands.

III.6 "In defense of Education" (217-229): St. Louis, Missouri October
1959 (217-229): In response to Sputnik, Congress passed the National
Defense Education Act allocating three hundred million dollars to what
previously had been a local responsibility. The purpose of such funding
is highly problematic:

   Not so long ago, it was universally agreed that the aim of education
   is the perfection of the individual, the evocation and realization
   of his humanity. Under the terms of the act, education--and the
   individual as well--becomes a means to an end, subordinated to the
   demands of national defense. The essence of what the defense
   measures are supposed to defend has been forgotten. p. 223

It is better to teach people, not subjects, to enliven, not deaden,
normal, enthusiastic curiosity.

III.7 "The Economics of Disarmament" Cleveland, Ohio November, 1959
(230-252): Public pressure produced present suspension of nuclear arms
testing. Disarmament prospects challenge America's highly militaristic
economy. Business leaders keep secret readied alternate peacetime
activities. Scientists have the intelligence and personal interest (at
present overwhelmingly employed by military funds) to consider peaceful
economics. Classical and Keynesian economic thought are outlined.

Public works could make good the function of the military sector:

   There is reproach to every citizen in a mere listing of the areas of
   neglect: education, hospitals and health services, housing, urban
   renewal, public transportation, soil conservation, reclamation,
   afforestation, air and water pollution, navigation and flood
   control. p. 248

Sentiment that making armaments destined for the dump is valid and
public works a waste of taxes is a psychological, rather than an
economic, matter.

III.8 "The Economics of Underdevelopment" Swarthmore College December
1960 (253-271): The Industrial Revolution acquired capital through
imposed deprivation. Current technologically provided capital surpluses
enable developed countries to invest in the industrialization of the
poorest. Creating more markets could also be in our economic interest.
American expenditures in the Third World are heavily militarily
oriented. Investment in agriculture sustains a relatively small
proportion on single (largely export destined) crop plantations,
making "beneficiary" nations of such investment import food for their
own needs. Mineral, including petroleum, resources largely advantage
foreign companies, unlikely to favour altering existing arrangements.

III.9 "The Economics of Abundance" Santa Barbara, California April 1961
(272-291): Technological advancement permits greater production with
less labour. Land is replaced as the basis of wealth. Automation rises
even to central nervous system functions actually exceeding human
capacity and eliminating white collar jobs. The gap separating needed
makers/distributors of goods and employable people has been made up by
a militaristic economy. Increasing automation can have another result:

   The liberation of people from tasks unworthy of human capacity
   should free that capacity for a host of activities now neglected in
   our civilization: teaching and learning, fundamental scientific
   investigation, the performing arts and the graphic arts, letters,
   the crafts, politics and social service. Characteristically these
   activities involve the interaction of people with people rather than
   with things. p. 289

III.10 "The Wilderness and the American Dream" to the Sierra Club San
Francisco April 1961 (292-298): Early American ideals were fairly
egalitarian; many late Nineteenth Century Americans were tenant farmers
and urban labourers. Today one third of Americans are at or below
subsistence living, others' well-being coming from suicidal militarism.
The wilderness remains awaiting humanity's awakening.
