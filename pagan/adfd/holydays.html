The Eight High Neo-Pagan Holy Days

This is retyped from the handwritten version located in a journal.
It was the rough draft from which was composed the copy sent to ADF
in September 2000 and likely is not identical to that final copy.
That copy could have contained a statement that as a Celt the four
days of Samhain, Imbolc, Bealtaine and Lughnasad resonated more with
me than the Norse, etc. solar days (with the exception of Persian
Naw Ruz) and likely added to Samhain the concept that this is a time
of renewal, but also of casting aside things from the past that have
run their course in influencing us, especially things that are not
beneficial.

Samhain is the threshold of the year, the most spiritual and
otherworldly time when the barriers or the curtains between the
worlds of the living and the realms of those who have gone ahead are
weakest. This is the time to recall the honoured dead, especially to
remember them, to pledge to live as their worthy successors and ask
their aid to live and to accomplish what merits accomplishment. This
is the beginning of winter, the time of darkness, storytelling and
poetry in the lengthening nights, the growth in the unconscious of
what will spring forth into the light of the brighter half of the
year.

Midwinter is the longest night, the point of the farthest departure
of the sun, when the land is most asleep, when energy may seem at
its lowest ebb. Yet in the mystic cycle of spiritual reality, the
seed of light is at the heart of this dark period and one not only
calls spiritually, ritually, hopefully and sure for the return of
the distant source of warmth, brightness and life, one honours,
reverences, worships the brilliant alter ego of night, that babe of
summer in the womb of winter.

Imbolc in traditional Ireland was the first milking of the lambs,
the first notice of life and spring in an agricultural society in a
climate far more humane than Ottawa's has been. This is Brigid's
Day, hence, a time, for me, especially inspiring, poetic and
stirring. Brigid is a goddess of childbirth and this is my birth
month. I have thus always had an opposite reaction to the normal
February blahs, when, at least here, it seems the usual response has
been to feel depressed at the length of winter. I, however, have
always rejoiced on Brigid's Day at the bright promise it holds.

Ostara is the first day of spring in the solar cycle with all the
symbolism of fertility, growth, life, transformation, quickening,
reawakening of the slumbering land from the cold dark time of
winter such brings. Long I've noticed the time between Ostara and
Bealtaine is the healthiest, most energized and most productive in
my year. In some Indo-European societies this was New Year's Day.
Personally, as one whose path carried me through a landscape in
which the Persian Naw Ruz was the start of the New Year, this day
will especially resonate for me in my open announcement that I am
pagan, as well as for the issues of religious tolerance and the
freedom of thought and expression.

Bealtaine, the great Celtic festival of life and light with all the
awesome, energizing, life giving fertility aspects other cultures
have placed at Ostara. This is a time especially arrayed with the
joys of youth, the arrival of spring and the warmth and brightness
of the lands, celebrations of spring, the delight in, warmth and
brightness, the growth of the vegetation of the lands. In ancient
Ireland this may have marked the pasturing of the herds. It is
considered a most auspicious time for conjugal unions. It is said
there was the symbolic lighting of the fires at Tara, the heart of
Ireland and the symbol of the sovereignty of that land.

Midsummer's Day, the longest day of the year, the counterpart to
Yule. As Yule bore in it the seed of the returning sun, so this day
contains within it the intimations of the ever turning wheel and the
slumbering in darkness of the earth so energizedly and brightly
awake. This is the height of summer, the day with the most time
available, especially in northern lands, to be outside in the bright
light and the climate, at least here, so often is perfect for that
closest invitation of nature that nature be embraced. It is neither
cold, nor usually is it unbearably hot as some of the days later in
summer are. While all the holy days are points along a natural
circle, this one is, in that sense, perhaps the most pleasant and
enjoyable of these.

Lughnasad was the time of the gathering of the tribes of Ireland, a
time of practical political consultations, a time of re-asserting
the physical health of the community in games of strength and skill,
including contests of speed, races. It was a first harvest festival,
a time remembering the dead (the concept is that the games of
Lughnasad were originally the funeral games at the mound of the
legendary Taltiu), though in a more physical manner in the light of
this world than the nightly and otherworldy Samhain, when the
portals between the realms stand open.

Mabon is the balance equalling Ostara, a time of equinox, when the
time of daylight and the darkness of the night are the same, though
while Ostara was a promise of the life of the land and the growth of
its vegetation, Mabon is a signpost of the slumbering of the earth,
with the harvest gathered into the storage in preparation for the
dark and the cold of winter. The animals, especially in this area of
the north, have begun performing their ritual activities of heading
to warmer climes, of gathering nuts. The trees have begun to colour
their leaves in splendour, starting to cast them aside in order to
bear the weight of winter snow. We humans, as we prepare ourselves
for the coming of the more indwelling time, thank the earth and the
gods for their gift of the harvest that grants us life in lifeless
winter and we ask to live worthily through that continually turning
wheel of the years.
