NINE WORLDS OF SEID-MAGIC, Jenny Blain, Routledge, London and New
York, 2002

This consideration of current efforts to recreate this aspect of the
Northern traditional way begins with a preface identifying the
author as anthropologist and as practitioner of what is being
studied. The habitual expressions of gratitude occur.

Chapter One, "Introducing shamanism, seidr, and self" (pp. 1-7),
mentions changing anthropology and acceptance of insiders' views,
introduces seidrworkers and spaewomen, states the goal of exploring
North European shamanism (seidr) in the context of modern
reconstructions based on archaeology, mediaeval literature and more
general shamanism.

Chapter Two, "The saying of the Norns" (pp. 8-30), begins with a
brief account of a modern guided meditation and seeress's prophecy.
It mentions the Nordic setting and traditional shamanic aspects,
such as drumming. It explores the reasons for people's involvement
(attunement to the land and nature spirits, connecting to ancestors,
responding to the theological need for polytheism and the feminine
in divinity, etc.), looks at terms (seidr, spae, spakona, volva) and
the degree of shamanism portrayed in the mediaeval literature (not
central and often described as foreign, e.g. Finnish).

Diana Paxson's work is mentioned and an account by Diana of a raven
encountered during a trance communicating to Diana that her
conscious mind is too active. Such encounters of power animals are
one aspect of traditional and neo shamanism. A seeress describes
another normal aspect of shamanism, death and recomposition. In this
case giants ate her, tossed her bones aside and Loki sang them to
life again, saying he did so because she'd given him an offering at
a ritual. Jenny Blain examines the term performance, for many
containing undesireable connotations of contrived, not real, but
for her meaning real, in contrast to rehearsal. She also looks at the
issue of the perception of the experiences of seidrworkers, the move
away from a single view to accept diversity as valid.

Chapter Three, "The Greenland Seeress" (pp. 31-46), draws on the
account in Eirik the Red's Saga and on Voluspa. Jenny Blain
describes a modern high seat ritual:

   The seidr leader may use various ways of 'warding' this space, by
   singing a runerow or calling to the drawf-guardians of the
   directions. She or he calls to the deities who themselves do
   seidr, Freyja and Odinn... Drumming and singing accompany and
   facilitate the induction of the ecstatic state. The guide
   narrates a meditative journey whereby all present, seers and
   questioners alike, travel down from an initial 'safe place',
   through a tunnel of trees, to the plain of Midgard and the great
   tree Yggdrasill, then below one of the roots of the World Tree
   past Urd's well and through caverns of Earth, or spiralling
   through various of the Nine Worlds, and finally across the
   echoing bridge with its guardian maiden Modgudr to the gates of
   Hel's realm, the abode of the dead, for in Old Norse tradition
   wisdom comes from the dead, the ancestors. p. 35

The seers are questioned by the audience and the dead answer through
the seers. The variety of seers' visions is mentioned (one sees the
realm of Hela and the numerous dead, another sees different deities
depending on which person is seeking answers, etc.), the different
purposes of seidrwork are listed (oracular, healing, protection).
There is discussion of the necessity of an imposed detailed setting.
Even some in the Northern tradition and using Yggdrasill to ascend
and descend to the Nine Worlds may object to the specifics of a
guided meditation, or even to a group guided meditation as such.
Others suggest that actually some may forget the details and that
such are useful in attaining the attention of that aspect of the
mind best focused in this manner.

The differences in the approaches of Diana Paxson's Hrafnar, of the
Swedish neo shamanic group Yggdrasill and of others are presented.

Chapter Four, "Approaching the spirits" (pp. 47-72), begins by
contrasting deep shamanic cultures, such as the Sami and the Dene,
with the Germanic which did have kings, queens, battle leaders and
priests of various deities. To others' definitions of shamanism
exclusively drawing on otherworldliness, Jenny Blain adds social
function and support, aware that such support was not always
complete in Germanic societies. Some references to seeresses in the
literature are cited and the abilities of the wise (foretelling the
future, shape shifting, calling fish and otherwise enhancing
prosperity). Neo shamans use drums, singing rune chants, rattles and
dance among methods for entering trances. The use of mind altering
substances is uncertainly attested in traditional Germanic shamanism
and keenly debated in neoshamanism. Usually, especially in America,
such are considered inappropriate. Some neo shamans are herbalists
in a healing sense.

The practise of going under the cloak is considered and compared to
the Celtic wrapping of a seer in the hide of a bull. There was also
"sitting out" (p. 62) at a mound or crossroads. The relationship to
spirits (plant, animal, ancestral, etc.) is examined. These are
independent entities who require negotiation and may still hinder
the shaman. Deity possession is mentioned. This can be planned or
unexpected. Unexpected also can be the arrival of some other spirits
including the dead seeress one seidrworker encountered. The issue of
respecting the spirits is raised and noted the insincere character
of some humans who may be in the audience.

Chapter Five, "The journey in the mound" (pp. 73-88), begins by
outlining the author's personal introductory experience with seidr
at Trothmoot near Kansas City at midsummer 1996. She was surprised
by the strength of the pull to follow the first seer and she was
asked to stand behind the chair of the third seer. She went again in
July 1996 as a seer with images of raven, whiteness, Wanderer, etc.
A third session was for the individuals in a group to meet animal
spirit guides. Raven she had met. Wolf she met. Others met fox,
goat, lion and lynx. A fourth session saw her running as a wolf.
There is the difference between entering such trance alone or with a
congenial group and taking a larger audience along. She recalls a
later session when someone called on Freyja and Freyja answered.
There were images (including aurochs, deer, cats, etc.) opening eyes
to darkness, the power of Freyja's reply and Freyja's exasperation
when the questioner was not satisfied with the answer. Visual images
are mentioned for this and other questions and the gist of the
answers these drew. A mound that is a significant part of her
spiritual landscape exists in the physical, in Scotland, and she
describes a physical visit to it and the sensations she had there.
Further experiences and answers to her question are provided.

Chapter Six, "Re-evaluating the Witch-Queen" (pp. 89-110), looks at
women magic users and seers in the sagas, including: Thordis in Saga
of the Water-dalers, Olof (Kjannok) in Heidarviga Saga, Geirid and
Katla in Eyrbyggja Saga, Thurid in Grettis Saga and Gunnhildr, the
Witch-Queen of the chapter's title. She is mentioned in a number of
sagas (Njal's, Egil's, Harald's) as being very skillful, though
evil. Some later accounts are clearly wrong, such as the one that
has her intending to marry someone, who is actually her brother.
Many are written by descendants of her enemies. Debate, thus,
continues in the Heathen community as to seidr meaning evil magic,
including messing with people's memories and personalities and being
restricted to women, or being something broader than that and which
anyone could practise.

Pages 100 and 101 quotes verse 22 of Voluspa and four translations
of it. These are discussed and such significant issues as whether it
should be "evil" or "unhappy" women. Childbirth, "The primary cause
of death for young women" (p. 105) is considered. Jenny Blain gives
her own rendition of Voluspa 22 which has Heidr being welcomed by
despairing women. There is the thought that women continued to
practise seidr in Iceland into the present time, to do what is
described in Eirik the Red's Saga, as well as other magic, even if
this was largely perceived as something women did, instead of as
religion. This is distinct from that spiritualism in the Nineteenth
Century brought into Iceland largely by priests and lawyers.

Chapter Seven, "Ergi-seidmen, queer transformations?" (pp. 111-141)
looks at men using seidr, starting with King Harald Finehair's
twentieth son, slain by King Harald's command. Shamans advising
based on unpredictable, non-rational, inexplicable, local
considerations have drawn the opposition of centralizing and
imperialist authorities. There's a look at men and magic in the
sagas, at Odinn's seidrworking, at considerations of magic as a
feminine and effeminate activity, at modern Heathen views, the novel
THE WAY OF WYRD and other non-academic treatments of Northern
shamanism, at some of the backgrounds of men doing seidr today and
the issue today of seidr being seen by some as for women and gay
men.

Issues of language again emerge, for example the term seidrberendur
can be seen as an insulting term for homosexual or as descriptively
indicating one bearing seidr within one's self. Also, there is the
thought that seidr was negatively regarded by many more for its
foreign origin than because of alleged homosexual connections. The
archaeological uncovering of many staves, some associated with
talisman pouches, etc., suggests that the foreign nature of seidr
may have been exaggerated, perhaps to distance as "other"
seidrworkers. The author offers another linguistic suggestion, that
the seidrman was effeminate largely because in the trance state he
was relying on others for physical protection; he was vulnerable.
Another's thought was that the word referred to the spirits
communicating through the seidrman, the seer's receptive role in the
process.

Chapter Eight, "The dance of the ancestors" (pp. 142-159), states it
is a summing up, notes the disagreements concerning seidr within
both academia and heathenry, names Diana Paxson as beginning modern
seidr and explores the debate on whether seidr is shamanism (looking
at a number of definitions of shamanism). She underlines the
diversity of the ecstatic trance experience, says she has met only
one seidrworker using the term shaman self referentially, though
there is the traditional aspect of shaman being a term bestowed by
the community, not one self appropriated.

There arise here again questions of authenticity and impartiality
and Jenny Blain remarks that more than reconstructing the past
modern seidrworkers are weaving from the strands of past centuries
what is for the present and future. The rationalist view on the
actual existence of spirits may be less important than the reality
of belief in spirits. There is sensitivity about taking from the
cultures of others and the fitness of dealing with the spirits
(natural, deific, ancestral).

This treatise is an interesting exploration of the topic, a fine
portrayal in academic garb of the re-emergence of the shamanistic
aspect of modern Heathenism, a fascinating personal account by one
of today's seidrworkers of the complexities connected with spirit
travel along the World Tree.
