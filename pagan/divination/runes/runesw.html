THE RUNIC WORKBOOK, Tony Willis, Sterling Publishing Co., New York,
1986

The first impression of this book is very offputting partly because
of the use of the Anglo-Saxon runic names with the elder futhark.
The bibliography does include Eliot, Thorsson and H.R. Ellis
Davidson, but there is also a tone in the text of the revelation of
hidden mystery to the New Age student: an emphatic instruction that
the book be read in order from cover to cover, the assertions both
that only one article was written on the runes from the mid 40s to
the early 70s and that J.R.R. Tolkien was part of a wider
dissemination of runic knowledge, now consciously being directed by
many Odinic lodges.

The concept of studying the runes as five fives (including the blank
rune, presented first) instead of three aetts; the emphasis given to
purchased rune sets ("At the end of this book is a list of
suppliers" p. 28, actually apparently not included in the copy I
saw), although the information is there that making it oneself is
better; the direction that generally a week of study per chapter is
required; the methodology of learning various ways of casting as one
learns the 5s, so that one is practising the traditional three lot
cast on F, U, Th, A plus the blank rune; the sprinkled data on
Qabalah, gemstones, flowers and Arthurian, astrological and
numerological correspondences (with extra Saturnian and only numbers
one to nine, "The Runes Ur, Ken, Peorth and Tir are ruled by 3" p.
103) add to a very New Age flavour, diminishing, likely for more
than this one reader, any really authentic feel.

That said, the reader can learn here the shapes of the elder futhark
(with careful proportionate instructions concerning their drawing)
and the Anglo-Saxon names for them, methods of casting and meanings:

   The appearance of THORN in a runecast often suggests that the
   querent is being wrong-headed in some direction, and the
   associated Runes will indicate whether that direction is to do
   with business, emotions, or finance. p. 47

   ANSUR is indicative of unbiased or honest advice. Because it is
   ruled by Mercury passive, it denotes the need for deliberation
   prior to action, and often signals the need to take advice before
   committing oneself further. For instance, in an astrological
   runecast, ANSUR in the Sixth, Eighth or Twelfth House may
   intimate that a timely checkup by the doctor could halt an
   infection in its early stages. p. 49

   KEN, therefore, is a significator of good health and strong
   powers of recuperation. p. 57

The book includes instructions on bindrunes:

   The one disadvantage to using a bindrune is that it cannot
   generally be made to contain any more than five runic symbols at
   most, and must therefore be limited to very simple requests.
   p. 147

   Although you should be careful not to eclipse the identity of any
   of the individual Runes from which a bindrune is constructed, it
   is a curious fact that when the final sigil is completed,
   'hidden' Runes applicable to the problem under review can often
   be discerned within the finished design. p. 148

Personally, I'd rather be more confident that I wasn't preparing a
request for the appearance of a chiding Egil Skallagrimsson (See
EGIL'S SAGA ch. 72).

I guess I'll continue to recommend other writers, such as Edred
Thorsson and Jennifer Smith for treatment of the runes.
