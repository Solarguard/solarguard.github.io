<H1>SAN KUO</H1>

<p>SAN KUO, THREE KINGDOMS, is one of the treasures of global literature. It has been translated more than once into English. This site now provides a summary of each of the one hundred and twenty chapters of the earliest, and most literary, translation, the 1925 one by C. H. Brewitt-Taylor, and a summary of some of the supplementary material from Moss Roberts' 1991 translation. It will, in the course of time, attempt to provide extensive commentary and links to other SAN KUO sites. At present it also includes Michael McKenny's first review of SAN KUO written a few years ago and "Preliminary Observations." This subsection was created and the four files of chapter summaries placed here on November 19, 2003. It was last updated on December 3, 2007.<p>

Links on this topic are many and numerous, due to the popularity not only of the classic novel, but also of the 84 episode TV series, role playing games, comic, etc. Here are three links from which anyone interested should be able to travel even further, if the info, gaming opportunities, discussion lists, etc. they themselves provide are still deemed incompletely satisfying:<p>
