BOLIVAR FOREVER, edited by the Venezuelan Embassy in Canada, the Office
of the Venezuelan Defence Attache accredited in Canada and the Canadian
Bolivarian Society, Ottawa, 1997

The forward (pp. 5-13) by Jose Ignacio Moreno Leon (Venezuelan
Ambassador to Canada) notes the Liberator's significant contributions in
his relatively short life.

Chapter One (pp. 15-31) is the biographical note by Manuel Perez Vila on
the birth (in Caracas on July 24, 1783), studious youth, European
visits, vow to free Spanish America, arduous efforts to fulfil that vow,
and broadminded vision, not fully realized before his early death on
December 17, 1830. His body was brought to Caracas in 1842.

Chapter Two (pp. 33-48) is the Spanish original of Chapter One.

Chapter Three (pp. 49-67) is adapted from Venezuelan President Rafael
Caldera's book, BOLIVAR FOREVER.

   While leading Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia to
   independence from Spain, one of the 19th Century's mightiest powers,
   he never lost sight of the social realities and institutional
   structures required to build a new nation. p. 51

   His challenge was to find the right balance between the different
   forces that would favour freedom without anarchy, authority without
   tyranny, and a system of checks and balances between different
   stately powers (the executive, the legislative and the judicial).
   p. 52

Chapter Four (pp. 63-71) is adapted from Gerhard Masur's SIMON BOLIVAR
chapter 34.

Simon Bolivar is Latin America's most admired leader. His early death
prevented him from achieving complete political success. His vision
transcended the nation.

Chapter Five (pages 73-185) contains six basic documents.

i. The Cartagenan Manifesto (pp. 75-88) amidst a specific urging to free
Venezuela asserts: government's responsibility to maintain order by
force, to maintain a well-trained army, to have a financially prudent
budget, to have an informed electorate rising above factionalism, to
overcome priestly inspired rebellion. 15/12/1812

ii. The Jamaica Letter (pp. 89-117) describes the South American
uprising against oppressive Spanish rule. He claims that by 1815 a
million people died in the fighting. 6/9/1815

   And shall Europe, the civilized, the merchant, the lover of liberty,
   allow an aged serpent, bent only on satisfying its venomous rage, to
   devour the fairest part of our globe? p. 94

   Europe could do Spain a service by dissuading her from her rash
   obstinacy, thereby at least sparing her the costs she is incurring
   and the blood she is expending. And if she will fix her attention on
   her own precincts she can build her prosperity and power upon more
   solid foundations than doubtful conquests, precarious commerce, and
   forceful exactions from remote and powerful peoples. p. 95

He condemns Spanish political and economic impositions on America, notes
the democratic nature of the popular resistence, imperial savagery, and
offers his assessment that in the short term independent America needs to
rise above parties, avoid monarchy, recognize reasonable geographical
limitations in the size of its republics, the advantages of centralized
government, and the importance of unity.

iii. The Angostura Address (pp. 119-156) in which he hands back his
authority as supreme commander to legislators. 15/2/1819

   At this moment the Supreme Chief of the Republic is no more than just
   a plain citizen, and such he wishes to remain until his death. p. 121

He outlines historical conditions, encourages practical and democratic
legislating and suggests centralized government.

   The most perfect system of government is that which results in the
   greatest possible measure of happiness and the maximum of social
   security (seguridad social) and political stability. p. 133

He points to historical examples (Athens, Sparta, Thebes, Rome, England
and France), recommending especially the British parliamentary system
(though not monarchy) with perhaps an hereditary senate. He suggests a
single law abiding executive, in place of the current triad. He urges a
national spirit balancing popular will and public authority. He
advocates attention to public education, and a popular, just government
producing humanity and peace.

iv. Message to the Congress of Bolivia (pp. 157-173) in presenting his
draft constitution with its focus on electoral eligibility requirements,
triadic legislative body (tribunate, senate, censorate), president for
life prevented most patronage appointments, and an independent popular
judiciary.

   Civil liberty is the one true freedom; the others are nominal, or
   they affect the citizens slightly. The inviolability of the
   individual - the true purpose of society and the source of all other
   safeguards - is guaranteed. p. 168

There is to be no slavery and no state religion. 14/5/1806

v. Message to the Constituent Congress of the Republic of Columbia (pp.
175-184) reviews historical circumstances, rejoices at the arrival of
peace, encourages free expression of views, rejects his continued power,
urges selection of a mediating chief magistrate, prudent financial
policy and respect for human rights. 20/1/1830

vi. The Last Proclamation (p. 185) expresses his love of liberty, urges
obedience of the government and wishes happiness to his native land.

Chapter Six, Bolivar and Canada (pp. 187-197) contains Bolivar's letter
in French on the death of John Robertson to the General's widow in
Montreal, an account in French of John Robertson and Robertson's English
notes on Bolivar to the editor of The Columbian in New York.

The Appendix (pp. 201-214) contain in Spanish basic documents of the
Bolivarian Society of Canada.

This glimpse of what is itself a glimpse of the towering figure of the
Liberator hopefully will inspire some people to search out more on this
significant life and to strive to attain his worthy goals.
