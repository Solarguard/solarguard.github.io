RAIDO THE RUNIC JOURNEY, Jennifer Smith, Tara Hill, Milton, Ontario
1994 (1993).

This little primer begins with a one page introduction mentioning
Robert Graves' WHITE GODDESS, and naming the more scholarly R.W.V.
Elliott's RUNES, AN INTRODUCTION as her fundamental inspiration.

Chapter One, "Origins" (pp. 1-3), begins with rune meaning secret in
North European languages. It mentions and provides sketches of
hallristningar (pre-runic rock carvings). It suggests a North Italic
origin for the runic alphabet. There is the First Century C.E. set
of wooden sticks marked with North Italic letters, likely a
diviner's set.

Chapter Two, "The History of the Futharks" (pp. 4-7), discusses and
sketches the Elder, Anglo-Saxon and Younger Futharks, as well as the
Irish ogham, stated to be unconnected to the Futharks. Mention is
made of runic finds, prosaic and otherwise. The various periods are
mentioned, including the break in 1639 and the revival in early
Twentieth Century Germany.

Chapter Three, "Sources" (pp. 8-11), begins with Tacitus, the Eddas,
Egil's Saga and the Havamal. There are carvings in stone going back
to the Fifth Century C.E., manuscripts and rune poems; writers of
manuscripts are Christians who may not have been fully conscious of
what they were preserving.

Part Two, "Transformation" (pp. 13-65), begins with a three page
introduction raising the issue of inter-relationship of individual
runes within the Futhark. There are the three aettir, the similarity
of fehu and othila and the contrast of fehu and uruz. There is the
possibility of seeing a process in the second aett, and by extension
in each aett, the whole Futhark seen as an ascending spiral.

The heart of the book, pp. 18-65, is the look at the runes in order
with threefold attributions: physical, mental and spiritual.

Fehu, cattle: wealth, self-worth, karma.

Uruz, aurochs: virility, subconscious, rite of passage. She notes
the god Ull and sees this as a very masculine energy. In my opinion,
the aurochs as the untamed female in the wild, is a possible
attribution, especially by traditional hunters. Ull had a feminine
counterpart, Ullin.

Thurisaz, giant: hardship, discipline, asceticism. She attributes it
to the Giants and Loki. Others place Thor here.

Ansuz, Odin: authority, intelligence, spiritual leadership.

Raido, journey: journey, change, discovery.

Kenaz, torch: answer, insight, enlightenment.

Gebo, gift: gift, generosity, gift from the Gods.

Wunjo, glory: success, balance, perfecting. Of course, it can be
cautioning against imbalance, etc.

Hagalaz, hail: loss, disappointment, spiritual preparation. She
mentions destruction of the old as preparation for the new.

Nauthiz, need: need, shortcoming, spiritual search.

Isa, ice: inactivity, contentment, meditation.

Jera, year, harvest: generally improvement in all three spheres.

Eihwaz, yew: death or dramatic change, bereavement, initiation.

Perth, dice cup, vulva: fertility, moving on, exploring occult
knowledge.

Algiz, protection: assistance, responsibility, threshold.

Sowulo, sun: success in all three spheres.

Teiwaz, Tyr: injury, competitiveness, sacred warrior.

Berkana, birch: newness, fresh perspective, feminine mysteries.

Ehwaz, horse: transportation, communication, psychic ability.

Mannaz, human: person, relationships, spiritual community and
connection to deity.

Laguz, water: discovering, surfacing, ministering.

Inguz, Ing (Freyr): labour, healthy self-image, inner harmony.

Dagaz, day: happiness, optimism, harmonious spirituality.

Othila, property: home, roots, Spiritual Master.

Part Three, "Application" (pp. 67-83), presents methods of runic
divination: one rune, three runes, scattering all on a white cloth
and selecting three, Tarot Celtic Cross, scattering nine from the
pouch with the variant of ending by drawing a tenth, and triskelion
which is scattering onto a cloth containing that three-fold pattern.

There are developing intuition, word associations, images and being
connected to the runes. There is selection of a rune set, either by
purchasing or making. There is consecration. There are runic
writing, rune row spells, bind runes, talismans, the magical uses of
different trees, personally cutting and colouring runes, etc.
Appendices provide the Icelandic and Anglo-Saxon rune poems. There
is a bibliography and note on the author.

This is a very good primer on the topic, highly recommended.
