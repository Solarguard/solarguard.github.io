<H1>United Nations and USA</H1>

Out of the horrors of devastating world wars, humanity sought to heal its wounds, the staggering consequences of a contentious attitude, by establishing global authority. These initial examples of planetary co-operation were and remain inadequate. Contentious self and segmented group interest, causes of devastating Twentieth Century global conflicts, remain entrenched in the propagandized belief systems of many lands, epitomized in conservative America.<p>   

The United States of America is intimately interwoven with the United Nations: It was an American president, Woodrow Wilson, who so ardently inspired the League of Nations, precursor to the UN. The UN is headquartered in the United States. More significantly, the United States stands out, especially under the current administration's previous statements and actions, as contrasting itself from the co-operative ideals of humanity's common endeavour to transcend divisive and military resolutions to disputes. The United States was also an early modern experiment in republican and federal government over a relatively large area of land. It does provide a highly illuminating case study of potential federation of the entire planet.<p> 

Last updated on June 1st, 2009 C.E. with the review of the first two hundred pages (pre Wundt) of David J. Murrays illuminating A History of Western Psycholgy, this site also provides a brief review of the UN volume, "Everyone's United Nations", a link to the UN official page and a link to the 2007 UN Parliamentary Assembly Campaign. Here also, in the format of early deliberations on the American Constitution, are brief essays suggesting some advantages of a broader united humanity. Other interesting material is outlined in the index below and in the SF section is a brief review of H.G. Wells's The World Set Free a novel written in 1914 that suggests an era of atomic bombs is one requiring planetary authority.<p>

Since around March 2004, Michael McKenny has been intently pondering the causes of human contention and the attitudes that have been so counter productive to the peace, prosperity and well being of humanity. Introductory remarks to this culminating work of his life have been placed here.<p>
