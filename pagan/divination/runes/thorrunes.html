RUNECASTER'S HANDBOOK, Edred Thorsson, Samuel Weiser, Yorke Beach,
Me., 1989 (originally as AT THE WELL OF WYRD, 1988)

This impressive introduction to Runic studies contains a preface
mentioning other volumes (though note the bibliographical info on
the copyright page) and inviting those interested to contact the
Rune-Gild.

There is a two and a half page introduction defining divination as
direct communication with the gods, speaking of runes as a gift of
Odhinn, stating the intent of the book to convey tradition where
this is known and reconstructive and innovative detail where
historical knowledge is lacking, and informing that study and
practise are required.

Chapter One, "Historical Background" (pp. 1-9), begins with the word
rune meaning secret in Germanic languages. It mentions that the
runes were only used by Germanic peoples, gives c. 200 BCE for the
possible origin of the Elder Futhark, notes the runes on the Meldorf
Brooch (50 CE) as the earliest found, refers to the Younger and
Anglo-Saxon runes, to written references, to the absence of
archaeological finds (postulating perishable material and deliberate
destruction after use), to linguistic evidence (eg. such terms as
stabaz, stave, suggesting carving on wood and brim-runar, sea runes,
suggesting calm seas as purpose). Tacitus is quoted, Caesar cited,
Voluspa and Havamal adduced.

There is the work and influence of von List in German. There is less
in English and the most popular, Ralph Blum, is declared unworthy.
Thorsson recommends only RUNE GAMES by Osborne and Longland.

Chapter Two, "Runic Divination Theory" (pp. 11-16), states the
imitative nature of runecasting, replicating Odhinn's act, and the
assumption by the runecaster of divine status. There are the Norns
(Fates): Urdhr (past), Verdhandi (present) and Skuld (future), and
other spiritual entities influencing fate. There is the Germanic
future auxiliary verb (will, shall in English) as evidence that the
future is perceived as alterable, although cultural, genetic and
individual characteristics often seem to define a pattern hard to
shake. There is, thus, awareness of probabilities, of synchronicity,
of wyrd, of illumined lines of likely and less likely happenings.

Chapter Three, "Runic Symbolism and Divinatory Tables," (pp. 17-66),
begins with careful recording of castings, individual perception,
reference to tradition and the "German Armanic system" (p. 17),
bright and murk staves and mention of the form of each runic entry,
including the provision of translated rune poems. Then follows the
Elder Futhark in order:

Fehu, cattle: Use wealth, including knowledge, wisely and ethically.

Uruz, aurochs: Use vitality for active strength and defense.

Thurisaz, giant: Be cautious, especially in external contacts.

Ansuz, Odhinn: Note the power of the word; attend ancestral ways.

Raido, riding: A journey, change requires forethought and planning.

Kenaz, torch: Creativity (others see this as insight, perception and
illumination).

Gebo, gift: Be generous and hospitable, prepared also to accept and
receive.

Runjo, joy: Health, harmony, friendship.

Hagalaz, hail: Crisis can lead to beneficial change.

Nauthiz, need: Act appropriately in response to deprivation.

Isa, ice: Introspection or possibly difficult transitions calling
for thoughtful resourcefulness. (Others see this as stability,
immobility, rigidity etc)

Jera, year, harvest: Reward, plenty.

Eihwaz, yew: Spirituality, discipline.

Perthro, lot cup: Joy and fellowship of the beer hall.

Algiz, protection (or Elhaz, elk): Approach cautiously.

Sowilo, sun: Hope, heed wise advice.

Tiwaz, Tyr: Justice, faith, possible success through sacrifice.

Berkano, birch: Beginnings, growth, change.

Ehwaz, horse: Harmony, teamwork.

Mannaz, human: Happy acceptance of one's humanity.

Laguz, water or lake: Tests, growth, progress. Can be unconscious.

Ingwaz, Ing (Freyr): Internal growth, rest.

Dagaz, day: Awakening.

Othilo, ancestral property: Home, heredity, homeland.

Chapter Four, "The Tools of Runecasting" (pp. 67-71), mentions the
basic magical theory of self-preparation, even if it's only writing
the runes on pieces of paper. It describes various media (wood,
paper, bone, stone) on which to carve or paint the runes. It lists
other material: cloth on which to make casts, cloth bag or wooden
box in which to carry runes, cup with which to cast runes and formal
stool on which sat traditional Erulian (runecaster). It underlines
the importance of individual intuition in selecting which material,
type of wood, etc. feels best to the runecaster.

Chapter Five, "Rites of Runecasting" (pp. 73-86), begins by saying
that ritual details are individual and urging at least an initial
consideration of the provided traditional method:

   After consulting all the traditional sources, the following
   complex ritual formula appears to have existed from the most
   ancient times:

   1) Cutting and scoring of staves

   2) Calling on the norns (or other gods and entities)

   3) Casting the staves (onto the white cloth)

   4) Calling on the gods (or other entities)

   5) Choosing staves (in threes or multiples of threes)

   6) Sitting on the theal's stool

   7) Reading of the staves

   8) Confirmation by omens, etc. p. 74

There is a look at time and place of runecasting. There is mention
of charging the runes as talismans. Ritual cutting, carving, dyeing,
charging, casting, reading, closing and augural or other
confirmation are outlined.

Chapter Six, "The Ways of Runecasting" (pp. 87-115), suggests laying
out the runes in the traditional three aettir pattern and
considering connections forward, backward, up and down, and also
meditating on one rune each day. There are aspects: bright and murk
staves, a rune landing face up or face down; runes may land at right
angles to others, blocking them. There are methods: the Nornic cast
as described by Tacitus; casting on the nine worlds: Asgardhr
(higher influences), Ljossalfheimr (mental), Midhgardhr (conscious),
Svartalfheimr (creative emotions), Hel (instinct), Muspellsheimr
(vital energy), Niflheimr (outside restrictions), Vanaheimr (erotic)
and Jotunheimr (confusion and tests); laying out randomly the runes
into the three rows of eight that are the Futhark order; the seven
realms (leaving out Muspellsheimr and Niflheimr); tossing and
considering the majority face up or face down on a central circle a
simple yes or no.

There are: guides to abbreviations, transliteration, pronunciation,
a glossary, bibliography and index.

This is a decent introduction to the topic.
