Chapter Eight Fishing

Now, it was bareheaded with plain black cloaks and wilted stocks
that the servants of evil stood and gaped. They seemed too
petrified to move, with one exception. One of them, the same one who
earlier had tried to stab me with a magic sword, who now stood
facing me with his own more impressive staff, uttered a single
syllable no human throat could have formed and tossed his staff at
me. My mind reached out and formed a magical barrier through which
it could not pass.

Here, however, the subtlety of their move was revealed. Here, was
where they cast their clever stroke. Yes, the staff itself came to
an abrupt halt. It was magical, as well I knew who had seen it
conjured out of thin air. However, even as it stopped its flight
towards me, even, indeed, as it bounced back off my mental barrier,
that staff exuded a thick and vaporous yellowish substance. My
barrier was specific. It would keep out any psychic attack. A purely
physical object, such as this smoke, it could stop no more than it
would keep away from my ears, the voices of my foes, or stop their
non hostile thoughts from entering my mind.

His fellows were busy intoning a plea to the ruler of darkness. And
the dark and loathsome smoke began to rise from the ground slowly
and steadily making its way higher and higher, towards my mouth and
nostrils.

This particular stroke I had failed to anticipate. Had I really been
a single Terran adept, I would have had to either withdraw from the
conflict, presuming I could, or fall a victim to the poisonous
vapour.

Yet, instantly, I and my colleagues had analyzed more than merely
the composition of the gas. "Kinarl's Seventh Atmospheric
Intervention," came a thought from Orange. Again, with the swiftness
of thought, three wizardly minds analyzed a suggested spell and
agreed on this counter measure. It had originally been designed for
five. Once again, we could, however, adapt it for the three of us.

So I completely ignored the gas swirling around my ankles and rising
higher. I stood there as if I were all alone enjoying the peace and
calm of an ordinary evening in a park.

With but a tiny fraction of my mind, I perceived that Kevin had
arrived in the park, cloaked in a shield of physical and psychic
invisibility. I could perceive the look of grim determination on his
face as his hands began to trace a glyph, a simple magical
character, calling forth one of the least of magical interventions
in the real world, one of the simplest spells and one of the first
learned by the new apprentice on his planet, and not coincidentally
on ours.

We three wizards traced the same three strokes through the air, and
our three minds envisioned the result along with his. Then Kevin
opened his mouth and there issued from it a single word, a word in a
language those interested in magic on this planet term the language
of the angels. I opened my mouth and uttered those syllables along
with him. However, my mind joined my two colleagues in secretly
focusing on a far more potent and powerful glyph of light, one known
only by those on our planet, who have reached the highest level of
magical training. The shape of this I adorned with an Enochian
character, so that should the sorcerers perceive it in my mind, they
would be fooled as to its origin, potency and purpose. This would
also conceal from them what I was intending.

The sorcerers had not been idle during the short time this had been
going on. The gas had been sent past my magical barrier. Now with a
perfectly combined visualization and actualization of a spell, not
against my barrier but in support of it, they strove to make it
concrete. And yet again, had they only been dealing with an ordinary
Terran adept they would have succeeded. I, however, could perceive
psychic plans with extraterrestrial clarity and with the same speed
as an earthly computer my mind could formulate responses to several
threats at once and activate those responses simultaneously.

What they had done was come up with a masterful response to my
supposedly inevitable move. It had seemed that at the last instant,
I could always withdraw, could simply teleport myself to some secure
place, anywhere on the planet. Now, however, they had moved to turn
my own occult shield against me, by turning it solid and programming
it to enclose me in with the gas, wherever I should seek to flee.

However, even as my mind was involved in several other magical
operations, it was able to reach into the psychic barrier, which
they were attempting to subvert. I felt the casting of their spell.
I felt their minds withdrawing from it, satisfied that I was
finished. At a deeper level, I altered what they had done. It was
now triggered to be activated not by my teleporting myself to a
different location, but at my mental command. It would then move not
to imprison me with the gas, but to whichever spot I directed.

Kevin whispered another four syllables, so softly that he himself
could not hear them. Surely the sorcerers failed to detect that
sound. Soon enough, though, they'd notice the result. Already a
gentle breeze was rising. Although I could not see it with my
physical eyes, my psychic awareness told me that the yellow vaporous
death was now above my waist. Still, I condescended upon it not a
single glance. The dark ones were standing there with their
anticipated revenge clear in their eyes, eagerly watching that vile
yellow smoke making its way higher and higher, ever closer to my
mouth and nostrils.

They seemed a bit surprised when they saw it sway, ever so slightly
in a faint breeze. I could read their thoughts that they had
calculated I would choose to flee rather than gamble at staving off
those wispy fingers now as high as my heart.

Their leader hurled a thought to taunt me, "We thank thee, O
greatest of the sorcerers on Earth and most inadept of all us
standing here! that thou hast chosen to remain and provide us with
the entertaining spectacle of thy demise."

I did not answer that thought, concentrating my mental effort on
preserving my cover to be a single and terrestrial magic user, and
concealing from them the spell, which I had placed upon the barrier,
and which would soon be acted upon.

Now the breeze grew stronger. It grabbed that writhing cloud and
hurled it towards the line of sorcerers. I could read their calm
assurance that the gas would only strike the barrier, a barrier that
now was also material, and remain with me. In but a moment, only an
instant longer than I could hold my breath, I would be writhing on
the ground, providing them more than a little amusement.

However, that did not occur. At the precise instant the wind had
begun to blow the vapour from me, I sent the mental command, "Now,"
to the barrier, which instantly appeared in a space a hundred metres
above the road just beyond the park.

The dark ones watched in disbelief and dismay as the still rising
fingers of their own handiwork flew through the air, grasping now
for them. And they trembled more than a little, and well they ought.
They who had concocted it and sent it forth to slay knew all too
well its potency.

They backed up. At first, they moved slowly, edging away from it.
However, as the breeze became a wind and lifted the vapour even
higher from the ground, they whirled, and as fast as they could run,
they ran. They dared not look back. It was gaining. Their occult
senses told them that. It was almost snapping at their heels.

"Change direction," came their leader's anxious thought. He shot off
at right angles. Less than a heartbeat later the others did the
same. When they reached the road beyond the park they slowed to a
halt. They could sense their gas vanish. They looked back. The air
was normal. It was as if there never had been any malefic yellowish
gas. My friends and magical colleagues had altered the molecular
structure of the gas. One of the things they permitted to remain to
tantalize, for an instant the noses of our adversaries, was the
faintest trace of ozone in the air.

The banished sorcerers stood clustered in a group on the far side of
the road. On their faces was the yearning to return, as well as the
grim realization, that for this night at least they had completely
failed in their terrible designs. I could feel their enormous
irritation that they had been driven forth, apparently by a single
foe, and one native to this planet.

One of them, the leader again, took a step forward.

He pulled the talisman from inside his cloak and pointed it at me.
"Remember him, Master," he said. "Now, please, take us away."

"Brainless grub, did I ask to be exposed?" came the projected rasp
of the talisman. "I'll take you away."

Here, I made my final move in this our first match. With the
swiftness of my thought, the barrier dropped the hundred metres from
above the sorcerer's head. We would have a prisoner to interrogate,
at our leisure, and we'd be able to determine the precise nature of
this talisman, probably on our own world, where their ability to
cause mischief as well as the possibility of their escape would be
next to zero.

Fast as I was, the talisman was faster still. Preoccupied by the
bitterness and rage it felt at this embarrassing defeat and the
incompetence of its underlings, it still felt the psychic net
dropping down. It flung the sorcerer backwards.

We weren't going to let it get away that easily. Lavishly expending
the energy of three wizards, I pointed at it and mentally pulled it
from the sorcerer's grip just as it propelled him backwards away
from the falling barrier.

Amazed, I felt its will work even past the barrier and the nine
sorcerers vanished from sight.

Then, I felt its rage ripening against me. I was awed at the
impression I had of the enormity of its strength.

"Thou hast no knowledge of what thou art attempting. Not all the
combined magical might of this insignificant planet can succeed in
imprisoning me. Thou hast sealed thy death."

"Babble on," I projected at it with a bravado I did not feel. "I've
caught you and I'm not letting you out of my hands." I stepped over
towards where it lay on the side of the road.

As the whisper of the rustling of the softest moonlit leaf in the
faintest breeze came Blue's warning. "Green, be careful. I don't
like the kind of power readings we're getting from that thing."

Despite the tremendous energy we had hurled into our shields, it
detected her thought.

"Ah," it projected, "so you were only pretending to be alone. No
doubt an entire Terran magical order, scores of you, are hurling the
energy of your life force trying to contain me. I did not lie. I did
not boast vainly. You cannot hold me. Till we meet again."

Then came the visual of a great marine predator leaping from a
fishing boat towards the sea.

I shot back with the image of a net larger than the boat wrapping
itself around the escaping sea creature.

It transmitted the picture of the sea beast growing larger, slashing
right through the net and splashing into the water below.

I shrieked mentally, as it wrenched free of me. The net in a psychic
way had been a representation of my will and inner essence. I
responded at once by visualizing the severed strands coming together
again. Then I dropped the image of the net, focusing instead on a
small aromatic green leaf, a balm for cuts. It worked. In an instant
my pain was gone. So, too, though, was the talisman.

I tried to send my mind in swift pursuit of it and its underlings.
However, I was too badly weakened and all I perceived was a spacial
distortion spell of tremendous power. "I'm getting the impression,"
I projected, "that they've moved through time as well as space."

"Is that accurate, though?" asked Orange. "It could be only a ploy,
a part of the illusory aspects of their spell."

"How can we tell?" I projected.

"That's one fish I'm not going to let get away," projected Blue.
"I'm the coastal dweller here and its final visual resonates with me
using my kraken finder thirteen to track it. Here's my attempt to
put an Enochian envelope around that. Green, are you alert enough to
verify that?"

"I'm only tired, not exhausted. Let's see." Despite my denial, I was
worn out. I confessed that to Blue. "Taking a moment to energize," I
projected, as I drew heavily on the reserves in the matrix ring. "I
think so, Blue, but I'm not at peak efficiency. It's up to you to
decide my reliability."

"I consider you completely reliable," she projected. "Orange, I may
need some energy. Green, go into meditation."

"No problem," beamed Orange. "I'll feed you all the energy I can.
Green, I'll handle Kevin. Blue, take care hauling in that thinking
fish or sentient gem or whatever it is. I'd really like to know its
genuine nature."

"Yes," I projected. "I never met anything like it before. Anyway,
time to introduce you two to Kevin. Then I'll get that needed rest."

It was a weary and grateful Kevin who came strolling across the
grass to meet me. He arrived almost simultaneously with Orange and
Blue, who came over from a different direction. At first, Kevin
didn't notice them. He smiled faintly and said, "I hope I'm never
that pleased to see you again."

"Me, too," I said with a levity that I did not feel. Although I
tried to appear buoyant and filled with energy on the surface, that
was difficult to pull off. I knew precisely how much of my own
energy I had been called upon to use in this magical confrontation,
as well as the exact amount that had been fed to me by my two
colleagues. Yes, I had replenished some of that when I'd gotten rid
of the radium. However, a lot had happened since then, especially in
the last few moments. That talisman had taken a lot out of me when
it had wrenched itself free.

Kevin's eyes reflected his awareness that this had not been so
one-sided a confrontation. I was touched to see the extent of his
sincere concern for me.

"Hi," said Orange out loud. Kevin swirled at once, his features grim
and his hands flexed into a spell casting position. Then he quickly
perceived that these were allies, not foes. He flashed an uncertain
smile.

"You must be Mr. Orange," he said. Then he raised a questioning brow
to Blue.

"My name is Blue," she said. There was no outward indication that
most of her attention was devoted to probing for our recently
departed enemy. "Pleased to meet you, Kevin. Green has told us about
you and your dream. I look forward to talking about it in more
detail. First, though, Green is going to need to rest for a moment,
no more than five minutes. I'm going to be mentally preoccupied
myself. Orange will do most of the talking for the next little
while."

I was vaguely aware of Orange explaining something to Kevin. I could
dimly sense that a light breeze touched me, carrying with it a
wholesome scent of Fall leaves and damp grass. These awarenesses
flickered across my mind in an instant. Then I was free of them and
much else, as I entered a state of restful relaxation that is more
than just rest and deeper than the deepest sleep. The only knowledge
I had of my surroundings was the barely conscious alertness that
would allow me to act were action needed.

Free for the moment, my spirit soared away to the world of my birth.
For a heartbeat that seemed hours long, I stood again at my tower in
the Southern Mountains of my own world inhaling the cool crisp air.
Then, I moved thousands of kilometres in a breath and before me lay
the Pool of Tears, the most sacred site on our planet. Just beyond
it rose the unpretentious Tower of the Wizards. I bent down, in my
astral form, and took a sip of that remarkably pure water.

I was amazed to hear the chirp of a gadara bird. They are not found
this far north. The gadara chirped again. Then the sound changed,
and what I heard with my mystic ear was the deep bass of an old man,
who sounded just a bit like my father. "Drink deep," the voice said.
"You have earned it. I am very pleased with you." A chill ran up my
spine, as I realized that this was Ay-yar, the god whose tears had
formed the pool. Why was he addressing me now? I felt confused. It
seemed somewhat excessive. However hard I'd struggled this evening,
surely it didn't merit such extraordinary attention from him.

"I am very pleased with you," the voice repeated. And then the
gadara chirped again.

I found myself back in my body on Earth. I opened my eyes, shaking
the residue of the astral image from my immediate consciousness. I
stretched and got up. I smiled at the three who were waiting for me.
"Ah, now I feel rested," I said.

"Welcome back, Green," projected Orange. "While you were resting I
probed around the circle of trees. I didn't find any clues as to
where those sorcerers may have gone, unless it's back to Thagazan,
but we'll hardly be eager to track them there. I've also been
chatting as best I can with your precocious Terran friend about his
dream. Kevin has quite the natural talent. I think this planet is
not so bereft of magical attainment as the Thagazani assume."

"I could have told you that," I projected. Then addressing Kevin, I
said aloud, "That sure feels good. I hope you and Orange had an
interesting talk while I was in trance."

"Trance? You were in a trance standing up?"

I glimpsed on the surface of his mind the image of himself lying
prone. He was wondering about one who claimed to be able to get into
a trance out in the open standing up. He also suspected something
else was going on. Blue's features, curiously distorted, also came
into his surface thoughts.

"Yes, I went into a kind of re-energizing trance. The confrontation
was very draining. My order has taught me how quickly to revitalize
a drained body and spirit. It's a trick, or rather an art, which may
be performed even standing up at the side of the road. It worked.
I'm feeling fine now."

"Is she in a trance, too?"

"No, she's doing something else. The precise magical manner the
enemy escaped gives her a way to try to locate at least one of
them."

"Kevin and I were chatting about his dream. It seems one of those
guys claims to have been there. Kevin also appears a bit
disappointed in me. He was expecting someone at least sixty years
old." That last was added to lighten the memory of the dream and the
so recent attack here.

"Really?" I said with a grin.

"Got it!" interrupted Blue telepathically. "Why am I not surprised.
It's hiding out in the gazebo in the park near Kevin's place."

"Are you sure?" projected Orange.

Blue beamed us the visual. This showed the gazebo was located in a
similar area of distortion to the one we'd encountered here.

"Green, is your Enochian up to getting us there really quick?"
projected Orange. "It could vanish for Light knows where any
instant."

"I'm not so sure," projected Blue. "My guess is that it would like
to lie low until the ceremony can be attempted again. Still, since
my guess could be wrong, I guess we better make sure."

"We're going to have to take Kevin with us," I projected.

"Absolutely," agreed Orange.

"Kevin," I said out loud. "Blue feels she's located our fish at the
gazebo in the park near your place. We're going to check it out.
We'd like you to come with us. We're going to arrange the
transportation."

"Like I'm going to want to become separated from the only guys I
know able to keep me alive," he said. "I should let you know that
there could be psychic impressions at that gazebo that have nothing
to do with these guys. It could be my own magical operations you're
picking up, as well as those of at least one coven of witches."

Blue smiled, "I suspect the witches you're talking about are no more
malefic than you are yourself. That's not at all what I'm talking
about. I didn't just pick up psychic energy there. I picked up
especially malevolent psychic energy, and the same kind of
distortion spells those apparently alien sorcerers used here to try
to conceal their little ritual we so providentially interrupted."

Her smile couldn't compare to the telepathic ones I was used to.
Still, it was enough to embarass this youthful male who clearly was
unused to much interaction with females his age.

It took him a moment to find his tongue. Then he said with a grin,
"I'm glad you can tell the difference between them and me."

"Oh, we've no trouble at all in that," I said.

"The transportation will be a bit unorthodox," said Orange with a
perfectly straight face. He nodded and I wove Enochian words around
our simple teleportation spell.
