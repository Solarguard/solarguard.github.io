RAINBOW Michael McKenny

Chapter Eleven Hunting

"I've missed you," Blue projected along with the visual of a lovely
blue vine on a green stemmed tree.

"And I've missed you, my love," I projected.

"It seems like such a long time you've been away."

"Only sixty seven Terran days. One good thing about all this
interference of offworld sorcerers in the affairs of this planet is
that it has brought you here."

"I can see in your mind," she projected with a mental laugh, "that
you found all the fascinating things here on this alien world almost
enough to match that."

"But not quite," I mentally laughed back in a mock defense.

It was the first time, since we had met, several centuries back,
that we'd been apart so long. When, on the basis of its scout's
report, the Galactic Federation had requested that we send a wizard
in secret to check out this planet for extra-terrestrial magic and
use the opportunity to conduct an in depth survey of the place, I
had seemed the logical choice. My specialization was the study of
the complex and ancient civilization and cultures of the people of
the vast southern region of our planet. I had spent centuries in
careful linguistic, sociological and parapsychological analysis
there. The same skills would be the best experience for this
interplanetary mission.

Blue and I might not like it, but we accepted it. It would have been
much easier to take, if we had not complied with the wishes of the
Federation that the investigator we sent should not return
physically until his mission was finished. Whatever the limitations
on the movements of Federation space ships, I could have returned
home using my own power. However, the Federation was convinced that
such paranormal activity could expose me, were the scout's fears
justified, and this could prove potentially very threatening to the
Federation. For more than two months, it had seemed that such
caution was unnecessary. Within the last twenty four hours we
wizards had been forced to revise that assessment.

One consolation which Blue and I had been granted was that she was
allowed to be the one I contacted by securely warded telepathy. As
the Terrans put it, that still was not the same as being there.

"Me too," she projected, and I realized what my train of thought had
been, and that Blue had read this.

"Well, what do you think?" asked Kevin. It was Friday evening. Life
had returned to normal, sort of. We had upgraded the wards at his
place. Kevin and I had gone to classes as usual, and now, while
Orange and Blue tried in different ways to track down the escaped
talisman, I'd come with Kevin to a gaming session at the place of
one of his friends.

I smiled and said, "It's okay, I guess." They had been quite
surprised when I'd revealed I didn't know what they were talking
about when they started discussing a popular science fiction series.
Since we had arrived a bit early for what was to be a late nighter
anyway, Kevin enthusiastically insisted we watch a taped episode.

"Okay! okay!" said Kevin. "This is one of the best episodes there
is."

"He's right," said one of the other guys there, a blond who'd been
absorbed in the show right from the beginning, even though he said
it was his fifth time seeing it. "This is hard to beat for the
action and for the subtlety of the plot."

I raised a hand. "Maybe, but don't forget this is the first time I'm
seeing one of these. You guys watched this series for years. It
means more to you. Also, my views on what's out there in space may
differ from yours."

"Yeah, but even on its own," said another guy, a short English
student with glasses, who'd only come in time to see the last half
of it, this time, "this is really some episode. Even if you've
never seen those aliens before, they must make an impression."

"Several different kinds," said Kevin.

"I prefer the spiritual ones," I said with a smile.

"Well, that's only one of three castes in that species," said the
short English student.

"Sound like Proto Indo-Europeans," I said.

"And how about that action," said the blond guy.

"I think," I said, "that's the hardest aspect for me to take.
Fighting with swords I can accept, because you're dealing with a
relatively undeveloped society. I agree with this book I'm reading
that any civilization which has the capacity for interstellar travel
is likely to be peaceful."

"You sound like one of my friends," laughed the short guy. "He's
ever the optimist, insisting that Earth is soon going to have world
peace and the UN turn into a world federal government."

"That sounds like a great idea," I said.

"You know what I like," said a third guy, a tall red head with
freckles, who'd kept quite till this point, "is that marvellous
villain. He's my favourite human in the show. I like most of the
aliens in the series, but I'm not too keen on many of the humans."

"Come on," said Kevin. "That security chief is pretty good, and both
commanders have been great and the doctor is alright as well.
I'll grant you most of the aliens are very good, but don't try to
tell me there are no good human characters."

The blond then asked about another character, one I didn't recall
seeing. I almost said so, until I glimpsed from Kevin's mind that
this was the name of a different character the same actor had played
long ago in the most famous science fiction show of all. I kept
quiet while the others commented.

After a few moments the redhead, our host and gamesmaster, said, 
"Anyway, how about getting started? You've got your character
sheets, I assume. Green, why don't you have a look at these extras
and pick one you like? That'll save us the time of having to roll up
a new one."

"Blue! Green!" came Orange's demanding mental call.

"Yes," I replied at the speed of thought.

"I think I've got something. Whether it's the missing sorcerers, the
talisman or something else, I can't say yet. As soon as I detected
it, a very heavy distortion field descended. However, I did get
this." Instantly, a visual appeared in my mind. I could tell that
Blue at a library computer terminal was receiving it, too. What we
were seeing was a wooded area which gave off a momentary reading of
unusually high psychic activity. I could tell that were it not dark
this would be quite a spectacular view of autumn leaves. Through the
trees in the distance lay what before sunset had been a sparkling
blue lake. Beside the lake there was a cottage.

"You got any idea where this is?" projected Blue.

"I'm working on it. Green, I'm grateful for all the Enochian you
beamed us. My matrix ring suggests I use this combination of
Tasalian and Enochian watch tower formulae."

"Go for it," I projected.

I sensed Orange's astral form rise high into the air. I mentally
observed the large area that lay below him. I felt him seeking a fit
for that image of the wooded lake and cottage. For a moment there
was a rapid blur of many unsuccessful attempts. Then everything
clicked into place, with the exception of any psychic abnormality.
The spot, some twenty five miles away, didn't even have a detectable
distortion.

"The best kind," projected Blue, echoing my thoughts.

"I agree," projected Orange. "What do you say I check it out? You
may want to get ready to be able to quickly move to this location.
You've got the fix on it?"

"Yes," Blue and I projected together.

"I'll log off the computer and join you shortly" Blue projected.

"What about Kevin?" I projected. "He's marked. I think it makes
sense if I stay here and keep an eye on him. I can still feed you
energy."

"Agreed," projected Orange.

"Sure," I said and took the sheets from him.

I watched through Orange's eyes as the surface of the world rapidly
drew closer. The woods here seemed completely deserted of all human
life. Then right ahead lay the cottage. It, too, appeared completely
untenanted. Everthing was still and soundless, as well as dark.

I felt Orange's astral senses honed to maximum alertness. A gentle
breeze was blowing. Orange visualized it blowing away any
nervousness and inattention he felt as he passed through the woods.
He also welcomed the sounds of the geese, owls, and other woodland
creatures.

"I'm going closer," Orange projected.

"Take care," projected Blue. "I've got a bad feeling about this."

Orange moved astrally through the woods closer to the lifeless
cottage. It was now barely half a dozen metres away. The trees came
right up to it. There were only three other cottages on this lake,
and they were on the other side. It appeared that they, too, were
deserted.

"Orange, be as careful checking this place out as we were checking
out the gazebo," I projected.

"Will do," replied Orange. He cautiously moved up to the one window
on this side of the cottage. Deeply and guardedly, he probed for any
hint of wards, which would indicate paranormal activity. There was
nothing.

"They can't be that good," projected Blue. However, our recent
experience had taught us such a healthy respect for them that Orange
mentally slid around the cottage, carefully checking each of the
walls, the windows, the one door, and even the roof and chimney.
Again, there was absolutely no sign of any psychic residue.

"Sure," I said answering our host and taking the character sheets.

"Ay-yar guide me, here goes," projected Orange. Metaphorically
holding his breath, Orange sent his mind inside. It was just a
simple cottage. There was a stove with a small pile of wood beside
it. There was a table with four chairs around it. There was an old
couch against one wall. There was a door leading to the single
bedroom which was as sparsely fournished as the main room. There was
no running water. We'd previously noticed the outhouse a dozen feet
away from the cottage. There was no electricity. There was a battery
operated radio on the table, and a kerosene lamp above it. There was
absolutely no food in the place.

"This place," projected Blue, "would appear to have been shut down
for the winter."

"Any theories and hypotheses?" asked Orange.

It took us less than a sixth of a second to bring to mind the
various possibilities, which included some subtle mental
misdirection. Did this mean that our enemies knew that Orange was
here?

"We'd better check out those other cottages," I projected.

Orange and Blue agreed this was logically the next step. Orange's
cloaked mind swung cautiously up above the trees and over the placid
waters of the lake. We sensed the fish and turtles below, as we had
sensed the rabbits, squirrels, racoons and mice in the woods. There
was no trace of human presence, let alone any indication of occult
influence.

It was a brief and intensive, though equally unsuccessful, search we
made of the other cottages.

I let my eyes scan a few of those sheets, and then a smile came onto
my face. "I think I'll take this magic user," I said.

"Well, what do we do now?" projected Orange. "We can scarcely use
this kind of energy to survey the whole region."

"Let's try a general scan of the immediate vicinity," projected
Blue. "How about a hundred metres from where you are in every
direction?"

"Okay," projected Orange. Blue and I viewed that penetrating sweep
which revealed nothing except trees and normal woodland life.

"Looks like we drew a blank," I projected.

"Guess so," projected Orange. "Wait a minute. What in the world is
that?" Immediately I received his visual of what could have been a
squirrel hole in a tree ninety seven point three metres away. It was
a wonder that we had noticed it at all. There was just the faintest
trace of a magical residue there, something so barely perceptible
that if Orange hadn't been in such a mode of absolute search, he
would never have detected it.

It did not feel as if it should be anything significant. However, we
did not count on that. Orange edged up astrally towards this
squirrel hole with the same care he had so recently shown on his
approach to the cottage. The first thing we noticed was that there
was no squirrel at home.

"I'm analyzing the chemical composition of the air here," he
projected. Diagrams and formulae flashed through his mind and were
beamed to ours. There was no indication of squirrel scent on that
particular tree.

"Notice," projected Blue, "how there's a markedly low insect and
animal presence here, as well."

"I think we've got what we came for," Orange projected, drawing more
energy from his ring of power. I joined Blue in sending him some of
mine. This would ensure that our cloak of psychic invisibility would
remain as firmly in place as possible. It would also allow him quite
a shield in the event of any sudden psychic attack.

"Okay, remember you're on the second floor of the ruins of Tathor
Castle. You're seeking an old scroll reputed to contain the location
of a phial of elvish nectar which will heal your king. As you
learned all too well last week, you are far from alone."

Orange went to within six centimetres of the hole. His psychic
senses remained on maximum alert. There was nothing, absolutely
nothing. "Too good to be true," he projected, "and it would take
enormous power to cloak this. I don't like it at all. How do you
suggest we proceed?"

"We ought to check out the whole tree," I projected.

"Wait a moment before doing anything," projected Blue. "Let's play
this safe. I'll join you."

"Agreed," projected Orange.

An instant later Blue's astral form appeared beside Orange's.
"Hello," she projected. "What an attractive site. I'm glad you
discovered it and agreed to let me come along."

"I'm grateful you came," projected Orange. "Are you ready? I'm going
right up to it."

"Ready," she replied.

"You're still in the room with the great stone statue. What do you
do?"

"Here goes," Orange projected, extending the wispiest tendril of his
astral awareness right up to the squirrel hole. He then probed the
entire exterior of the tree, every square centimetre of trunk,
branch and leaf and still there was nothing. His awareness dropped
into the ground and followed the whole root system. Again nothing.

"I'm going in," he projected, as he eased his awareness inside the
hole. "There's nothing here." I could see that he was right.
Darkness alone filled our minds' eyes. "It's just an empty black..."

Flash! Our senses were inundated with a surging ocean of
impressions. It was as if we'd stepped inside a sun going nova, and
no sun in any galexy familiar to normal physical beings.

We had no time, even at the incredibly rapid pace of our thought
processes, to take in everything that lay before our psychic eyes.
Orange had stumbled through the portal to some other dimensional
existence, glimpsed the inimical complexities of its structure and
the entities residing there, and in half a dozen microseconds he had
thrown himself out.

"This has got to be closed," he projected.

"Let's use Protectorate Fifty Three Alternative Three A," I
suggested.

"You and your obscure Southern history." Orange's projection seemed
a bit exasperated, no doubt largely due to his wanting to act at
once. "I'm not very familiar with Protectorate spells."

"This one seems to be how Erissa dealt with the Thantay," I
explained.

"We've already checked this room pretty thoroughly," Kevin said,
clearly for my benefit. "I guess we'll probably go out the door at
the southern end, as we came in at the northern door." He looked at
the others.

"Let's not waste time deciding which spell to use," projected Blue.
"Show us how it works, including the Enochian envelope, if it
requires a special one."

"I'm using a basic Enochian envelope," I projected, visualizng an
ordinary sheet of paper with Gvihlih-hihn writing on it slipping
into a standard Terran envelope. Then I beamed to them the intricate
details of this apt and potent spell from our planet's distant past.

"Okay, now I see it," projected Orange. "Sorry, I was snappy."

"Don't mention it," I projected.

"Everyone ready," came Blue's thought. "Here goes." At once our
three minds activated the spell.

"Complete success," projected Orange, relieved as he realized we had
successfully unfolded our spell and we could feel the portal being
sealed.

"Not exactly," projected Blue.

Even as we observed the shimmering that swept over that small hole,
even as the thick wood and the bark of that tree began to appear
where the hole had been, something darted out of the hole and
rapidly soared up above the treetops. It was very small, smaller
even than a black fly. It would have been very easy to miss it, or
to underrate it.

"Blue," I projected, "you're the expert in entomology amongst us.
Why don't you handle this?"

"I prefer plants, especially sweet scented flowers," she projected,
"but I'll try." I felt her consciousness rise and move towards the
tiny object hurtling through the sky.

"Attempting analysis," she projected. This was followed swiftly by a
kaleidoscope of mental images, schematic diagrams of its structure.
"It's not an insect," she continued. "At least it bears no
resemblance to any insect on our world or on this. According to our
system of classification, this is closest to a reptile."

"That's right," said the tall gamer. "We go up to the southern door
and open it."

The thing about it which most stuck in my mind was that it had
wings with tiny black scales.

"What about the brain?" inquired Orange.

"I'm trying," she replied. "I'm having a lot of trouble, almost like
interference. Yes, there it is. We're starting to rise into
mammalian, even human levels of intelligence. Wait a minute. This
thing has magical capacity. I'm reading..."

Abruptly Blue's mind came flailing away from it, and not through any
action of her own. The creature itself had casually tossed off the
mental probe of one of the most powerful wizards in our galaxy. With
no chance to control the direction of her mind, so cavalierly
brushed aside by the black fly which was more than a black fly, she
came mentally spinning and bouncing across the forest floor.
