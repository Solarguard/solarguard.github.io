<center>THE TAIN</center><p>

transl. Thomas Kinsella, Oxford, 1970.<p>

This is the core of the Ulster cycle. As usual with epics, there is a whole 
corpus of material filling in details, such as how come Cu Chulainn fights so 
long without the Ulster warriors arriving. They are in their pangs because of 
the way Macha was treated. (p. 6ff) This edition contains several of these 
pre-tails, remscela, including the Derdriu story ("The Exile of the Sons of 
Uisliu"), the birth accounts of Conchobor and Cu Chulainn, the story of how Cu 
Chulainn fought his seven year old son and how the two bulls came to be from two 
pig-keepers.<p>

The introduction to this volume includes four pages of maps, a bibliography and 
an advisement that the story is susceptible to some quite varied extrapolations. 
Two things which struck me in this regard are the apparent similarity of Cu 
Chulainn's salmon leap to the jump of the Taoist Master (for example, see the 
description by Deng Ming-Dao in his biography of Kwan Saihung, THE WANDERING 
TAOIST, Harper and Row, 1986 p 97ff) and the metaphorical understandings of THE 
BHAGAVAD GITA, in which Arjuna, the royal charioteer, being encouraged to 
participate in the battle has been seen as the spirit being urged to use 
willpower to combat the inclinations of the flesh.<p>

The essential nature of all such deductions is that they are subjective and that 
the epic can well be enjoyed as an exciting story apart from analyses of the 
numerous origins of names provided, thoughts that monastic skittishness may be 
discerned in some tellings of adulterous or incestuous relationships and 
theories of Classical descriptions of Gaul influencing later Irish authors, 
etc.<p>

The story describes the rivalry between Ulster and Connacht, the incitement of 
King Conchobor by his extra-ordinary wife to attempt the seizing of the prize 
bull of Ulster and on the incapacitation of the warriors of Ulster, the single 
handed opposition to the invaders by Cu Chulainn, the sentry or watchdog, whose 
remarkable accomplishments as a youth are recounted and whose repeated and 
devastating repulse of the invaders forms a large portion of the story. One 
climactic event is the one on one combat between Cu Chulainn and his foster 
brother, Ferdia. The quantity of verse in this section heightens its impact.<p>

Among the many fascinating points in the tale is how the Morrigan, often 
portrayed as a frightening destroyer in battle, heals a wounded Cu Chulainn by 
providing him milk from the teats of a cow (pp 136-137), how Cu Chulainn was 
able to delay the invaders by carving an ogam challenge (p. 68ff) and Cethern's 
killing of the healers who pronounced his wounds incurable (p. 207).<p>

The story contains inconsistencies, for example, Cu Chulain's living happily 
ever after with Medb's daughter, Finnabair, who was described as dying on page 
215. And, as mentioned above it may be read according to a vast variety of 
mythological and symbolic impressions, including such impressions of the great 
contest at the end between the two champion bulls. While such a spectrum of 
deductions may hold fascinating subjective validity, as normal with such 
interpretations of poetic and sacred text, determination of a single objective 
reality is likely both highly contentious and incorrect.
