<h2>The Rise of Civilization in East Asia, the Archaeology of China, Korea
and Japan</h2>

Gina L. Barnes, Thames and Hudson, London, 1999 (1992)<p>

<p>This is a very interesting book treating the region, rather than a
specific country. It begins by ensuring the reader is aware of terms and
chronology. There is then a consideration of the development of
archaeology in the region. Sung Neo-Confucianism:

<blockquote>Encouraged empericism in the cataloging of bronzes and jades dating
   from the Shang to Han Dynasties lodged in imperial and private
   collections. Surprisingly modernistic techniques of observation and
   representation were deployed in measuring the artifacts, drawing
   their profiles, describing their decoration, and copying any
   inscriptions. p. 28 ... The great contribution of modern archaeology
   was not the introduction of methods of observation, description and
   excavation, which as noted above were all variously present in the
   antiquarianism of the region. It was the introduction of the
   possibility of a past -- the very idea of 'pre-history' -- that
   resided external to written history and was accessible through
   excavation. p. 29</blockquote>

<p>Next the book mentions personalities connected with archaeology in the
region since 1877, the growth of archaeological organizations and the
involvement of the state, as well as such concepts as not viewing a
distinction between private and public land 

<blockquote>In Japan, all buried objects are decreed to be the property of their
   original owners (however many centuries in the past!); and if they or
   their descendants cannot be located, the state takes custody of them.
   p. 36</blockquote>

<p>and using, "Upper," in the sense of "Oldest," opposite to Western
archaeological usage. p. 39

<p>Chapter Three, "The Earliest Inhabitants", begins by looking at human
colonization of East Asia. It mentions one Chinese opinion that Homo
erectus developed locally, noting that Ramapithecus lived in
Southwestern China, and a vast geographical area outside of China eight
or more million years ago. Also, even those who accept the dominant
evolutionary view of immigration of humans from Africa are divided as to
when this happened and the dating of Homo erectus fossils. This leads to
a discussion of the site at Choukoutien containing, "The largest number
of Homo erectus fossils in the world." p. 44

<p>The author proceeds to consider Palaeolithic sites in Japan and Korea
and then the debate as to whether Homo sapiens sapiens arrived from
Africa or emerged locally. The prevailing Western view, "Requiring the
evolution of species to occur only within small, reproductively isolated
groups," p. 52 is not so widely held by East Asian archaeologists. And,

<blockquote>Several fossils identified as transitional between the two species
   and labelled Homo sapiens have been discovered at the Chinese sites
   of Dingcun, Maba, Changyang, Dali, Jinniushan, and Quyuanhekou. p. 53</blockquote>

<p>Chapter Four, "Innovations of Modern Humans",  begins by mentioning the
widely fluctuating coast line as global temperatures rose and fell.

<blockquote>During cold phases 70,000, 50,000 and 37,000 years ago and then again
   during the last glacial maximum at 18,000 years ago, the Yellow Plain
   and the Seto Plain were exposed by lower sea levels, and the Japan
   Sea became merely a large lake which drained through the present
   Korea Strait. These increased land areas facilitated the movement of
   humans and animals among and between parts of East Asia that are now
   separated by large expanses of water. p. 55</blockquote>

<p>The chapter considers various stone technologies, the mobile nature of
the hunting lifestyle, some settlements such as Sokchangni in Korea, the
locating of settlements near stone resources, and Palaeolithic art.

<blockquote>The advent of Homo sapiens sapiens was not just a biological
   phenomenon; it was also a psychological revolution, accompanied by
   the development of self-consciousness and aesthetic appreciation. The
   suddenly felt need to bury the dead, the use of body ornaments, and
   the creation of cave and portable art followed from these changes and
   have been cited as the major attributes of human modernity. In East
   Asia, these changes manifested themselves in the Late Palaeolithic.
   p. 62</blockquote>

<p>This includes ceramics, the earliest examples of which in the world have
been dated at c. 12,000 years ago and come from sites in Japan. The
chapter continues with reference to changes in forest types because of
changing climatic conditions and to the appearance of, "Dug-out canoes
and huts built with posts." p. 68 

<p>Chapter Five, "Littoral Foragers", begins by mentioning Chulmun and
Jomon fishing and shellfish collecting, underlining the presence of
pottery, unusual in non-agricultural societies. It mentions that, "The
dog was the only domesticated animal in the Japanese Islands throughout
the Jomon period." p. 77 It mentions the theory of an exchange network
among three different ceramic cultures. It concludes by referring to
evidence for agriculture during the Jomon period.

<p>Chapter Six, "Agricultural Beginnings", looks at early agriculture on
the mainland, millet cultivation in the north (with domestication of
dogs, pigs and chickens) and rice in the south. Among the remains of the
southern site of Hemudu are bone flutes dated to c. 5,000 BCE. Also from
that site:

<blockquote>Both ceramics and bone materials were vehicles for sophisticated
   artistic renditions of plant, animal and human designs during the
   site's thousand years of existence. Favoured representations seem to
   have been of birds, petals and leaves; pigs occur both as drawings
   and as figurines. p. 94</blockquote>

<p>The chapter continues with a look at domestication of plants and animals
and a consideration of different Neolithic cultures. Beside the
north-south millet-rice divide is an east-west split in pottery
traditions. It also mentions the hypothesis of periodic abandonment of
settlements in swidden ("slash-and-burn") agriculture.

<p>Chapter Seven, "The Emergence of Neolithic Elites", begins by looking at
cultures (Hong-shan, Ta-wen-kou, Liang-chou):

<blockquote>Noted for their amazing jade artifacts. Trends towards status
   differentiation, craft specialization and public architecture are
   evident in these societies. p. 108</blockquote>

<p>It continues by looking at Lung-shan cultures whose, "Walled
settlements, and a sudden proliferation of projectile points," p. 113
are among the factors indicating increased violence. Human sacrifice
and, "The custom of heat-cracking animal scapulae for divination
purposes" p. 116 also appear. Such divination was, "Already in use in
the Fuhe culture of the eastern Mongolian Plateau in 3700 BC," and, "Was
adopted by all the Longshan cultures and also Qijia in the far northwest
during the 3rd millennium BC." p. 116

<p>Chapter Eight, "The Mainland Bronze Age", mentions the obscurity of the
origins of bronze in China and the view of Chinese archaeologists that
it was a local innovation, not a technique imported from Western Asia.
The Shang used bronze for ritual vessels and weapons. The author
observes that, "In the northern Zhou states of the succeeding period,
possession of such ritual vessels (the 'Nine Bronze Tripods') was the
tangible evidence of the right to rule." p. 125 There follows
consideration of Shang sites, especially An Yang which includes, "A
royal Shang cemetery, a palace and temple complex, many housing areas
for aristocrats and commoners, and craft workshops." p. 127 There is
then the, "Contemporaneous" "Alleged predynastic 'capital' of the Zhou,"
wherein appear, "Two very important aspects of subsequent elite
architecture in East Asia: the use of ceramic tiles and stone." p. 129 

<p>Chapter Nine, "Early Mainland Sites", begins by mentioning the oracle
bone inscriptions with the information they provide on Shang territory
and organization. The chapter proceeds to consider the Chou and the
importance of warfare and sacrifice for their aristocrats. It mentions
the prevalence of chariots. The earliest East Asian chariots uncovered
were at An Yang and date from c. 1300 BCE.

<blockquote>The burial of splendidly fitted-out chariots, complete with horses in
   harness, in pits at the mouths of the shaft tombs at Anyang suggest
   that they also functioned as royal prestige items. Chariots continued
   to be an important component in Zhou-period burials." p. 145</blockquote> 

<p>The use of infantry (6th C BCE) and cavalry (5th C BCE) reduced the role
of chariots in warfare. Defensively, long-walls, forerunners of the
Great Wall, begin, "As early as the 7th Century BC." p. 146

<p>Next comes a look at Chou coinage, spade-shaped, knife-shaped and the
stamp-plate coins of Ch'u. This is followed by a mention of the use of
iron in the Chou period.

<p>Chapter Ten, "The Northern Frontier", considers the remains of the
peoples of the North. It mentions the development of nomadism.

<blockquote>It has been argued that the crucial element in the development of
   nomadic pastoralism was the invention of transportation -- carts and 
    horses that could carry groups and their possessions in the constant
   searching out of sufficient pasturage for large herds. p. 154</blockquote>

<p>The chapter mentions the appearance of the domesticated horse in the
area in early Chou times. It cautions against ethnic identification of
archaeological cultures. It looks at the Bronze Age on the Korean
Peninsula, including the dolmens.

<p>Chapter Eleven, "The Spread of Rice Agriculture", considers the spread
of wet-rice technology from the Shanghai Delta to the Korean Peninsula
and the Japanese Islands. 

<blockquote>The current best estimate is that rice technology was introduced into
   the Korean Peninsula in the late 2nd millennium BC. p. 170</blockquote>

<p>It mentions the formation of Yayoi in Japan and the complexity and
variety of that culture or cultures. 

<p>Chapter Twelve, "The Making and Breaking of Empire", mentions the Ch'in
and then the Han Dynasties, the arrangement of the capitals of Ch'ang An
and Lo-yang, Han kingdoms and commanderies, Han expansion to the south
and northwest, the giving of seals and inscribed mirrors to foreign
envoys, and the Ma-wang-tui tombs.

<blockquote>Included were many kinds of silk, hundreds of lacquerware vessels and
   vanity boxes (one of which contained a cosmetic mirror along with
   other toilet articles), ceramics, musical instruments, game boards,
   bronzes with gilt surfaces and jade inlay, weapons inlaid with gold,
   bronze and silver belt hooks, beads, maps and paintings on silk,
   bamboo and wooden script texts (including an important astronomical
   treatise), plus a multitude of food offerings with exotic spices. It
   is significant that only ceramic replicas of coins -- not the real
   thing -- were deposited in this tomb: indeed real coins were rarely
   included in Early Han tombs. p. 202</blockquote>

<p>The chapter proceeds by mentioning the state monopolies on iron, salt
and the minting of coins. It continues with a reference to the Silk Road
and the Central Asian products that came into China. And, it discusses
the arrival of Buddhism, and its success in the confused times during
and following the collapse of the Han Dynasty. There is reference to the
spectacular Buddhist cave temples at such sites as Tun-huang.

<p>Chapter Thirteen, "The Yellow Sea Interaction Sphere", notes, "The
distribution of knife coins as far south as Okinawa," p. 208 and Chou
influence on the Korean Peninsula. It mentions Chosen attacked by the
Han and the commanderies established in 108 BCE and later in the area.
It looks at the political entities on the Peninsula south of these
commanderies. It examines Japanese contacts with the Peninsula and with
Han China. This includes the reference in Chinese history to Queen
Himiko, "Who apparently employed shamanistic skills in her reign." p.
219

<p>Chapter Fourteen, "The Mounded Tomb Cultures", looks at Koguryo,
Paekche, Shilla and Yamato, at the impressive mounded tombs prepared for
their royal burials, at the influence of Confucianism in Koguryo, at the
arrival of Buddhism, at the, "Patterned shifts in alliances and
hostilities," p. 243 at the impact of Sui and T'ang China on the Korean
Peninsula and at the protective Buddhist monument at Sokkuram, Shilla.

<p>Chapter Fifteen, "East Asian Civilization", looks at T'ang influence on
Japan and Korea with the reforms bringing T'ang administrative law to
Japan, with the adoption of the gridded city in Korea and Japan, with
the replication of T'ang cremation urns and Buddhist pagodas. The
chapter also mentions the increased contact T'an China had with places
to the west and how artifacts from those western lands (for example,
Persia) have been found at sites in Korea and Japan.

<p>Chapter Sixteen, "Epilogue", mentions that

<blockquote>With the emulation of T'ang Dynasty (618-906) government and culture
   by societies surrounding China during the 7th and 8th centuries, for the
   first time East Asia becomes a coherent regional entity based on common
   aesthetic values and philosophy, literary tradition and state structure.
   p. 261</blockquote>

<p>It then looks at subsequent history, porcelain production, underwater
archaeology, the excavation of nearly a hundred elite Ming tombs, urban
archaeology and future prospects for East Asian archaeology.

<p>Each of the fifteen main chapters contains a boxed section, focusing in
a page or so on a specific point such as: Confucianism, Neolithic
ceramics, iron technology and Han tombs. These are interesting additions
to the material contained in the text proper. The book is also very
richly illustrated.

<p>This is a quite fascinating volume, presenting a good look at East Asian
archaeology and its similarities to and its differences from archaeology
elsewhere. It is highly recommended.<p>
