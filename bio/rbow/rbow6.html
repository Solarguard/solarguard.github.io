RAINBOW Michael McKenny

Chapter Six Search

It was a pleasant stroll through the city towards the library. We
chatted half seriously, half humorously, as we continued the
discussion we had planned concerning the joys of chess and the
pleasures of role playing games. If anyone really was listening to
us, we gave him nothing to distinguish us from any of the other
thousands of students in the city.

At last the modernistic structure of the main branch of the Ottawa
Public Library rose up before us.

"It's not so tall a building," said Blue, "relatively speaking, or
does it extend there?" She pointed to the left of it.

"No," I replied, "though it is capacious enough, again relatively
speaking."

"I suppose," said Orange, "that it has quite a variety of material."

"There is a fairly good selection of modern fiction", I said, "not
that I've read much of that. I've checked more into history and
geography, especially political geography. It's okay in those
subjects. I'm sorry, but I didn't know you were coming, or else I'd
have had a look for works on music."

"No problem," said Orange. "I can do that myself, though maybe not
this evening."

"What about, you know, like the occult?" asked Blue.

"I'm not so impressed there," I replied. "As far as I can tell,
There's almost nothing at all of any serious esoteric interest,
though there are some books which could be called New Age. I'm a bit
surprised that I can't even find the fiction of Dion Fortune here,"

"Do you think," asked Blue, "that's because those responsible for
acquisitions at the library want to keep such works out of the hands
of the general public?"

"Maybe that has more to do with it," said Orange, pointing at a sign
advising the times books for sale could be purchased.

"What? I don't believe it," said Blue. "How can anyone running a
library sell off books?"

"Unthinkable," I said. "Well, conceiveably they had Dion Fortune's
fiction and lots of other esoterica and sold it all off. That
wouldn't enhance my opinion of those responsible."

We followed Blue up to the place my reports had informed her that
computer terminals tended to be less occupied, at least when I
tried, especially at supper time. Someone was there, but no one was
waiting behind him. Blue walked over and stood close to him. When he
saw her and noticed us as well, he held up the fingers of one hand.
"Five minutes," he said.

Blue nodded and continued to wait.

"I should get my own account and start exploring the Internet on my
own," said Orange.

"It's fascinating," I said, and soon we were off on the pleasures
of the Internet with all the awesome amount of information one could
access there. 

The five minutes turned out to be closer to twenty. Still, at last
the guy stood up, looking not the least bit apologetic or
embarassed that he had miscalculated by a factor of four.

Blue could tell what I was thinking even without reading my mind. I
received her physical smile as she said, "Green, you are so
mathematically precise. Haven't you heard the latest axiom of
Einstein's relativity theory which states that when one is on the
computer time moves at a different rate for him than for the rest of
humanity. So please don't get upset, if I end up using most of my
hour." Then she sat down and started typing away while Orange and I
continued our discussion about the Internet.

In reality it only took her twenty three minutes. Then we were
walking downstairs towards the door.

"Nothing absolutely definite yet," said Blue. "One of my virtual
friends feels that the information I'm looking for is on this side
of the Atlantic. I sent out a few other messages, but I guess I'll
have to wait a while for replies."

"Very interesting," said Orange.

"I hope Kevin can help us out," I said.

Soon we were outside and once again strolling through the streets
of the Terran city. We were talking with the mirth and ernestness of
youth. We continued to discuss, with some enthusiasm, the Internet.
A quick forty minutes brought us across the canal, over to Rideau
Street and then down to the park just in front of Wallis House, an
historic structure whose lengthy background included service as a
hospital and military base.

"Ah," said Orange, "This park has quite a feel to it."

"Yes," I replied. "And not without reason. I've read that a couple
of centuries ago, when people first started the settlement that
would grow into this city, they had their first cemeteries here. A
century and a half ago, or whenever it was, the place had expanded
enough for those cemeteries to be in the way. So, they opened the
two larger cemeteries a couple of miles further out. The graves were
moved from here to those newer cemeteries."

Blue held up her hand. she looked around. I could see that she
wanted to say something, but was weighing her words in case they
were being overheard. What she said gave me a start. "I wonder what
this place looks like at night."

It was clear from the stresses of her words that she had some kind
of psychic sensation concerning that.

"Kevin might be able to answer that question better for you," said
Orange. "After all, since we've walked almost the full time you said
it would take," he said glancing at me, "I assume we must be
very close to his place."

"Yes," I said. "Just a couple of blocks this way."

When we got to the building in which he had his apartment, we did
not find him home. I could see that Blue especially was very
concerned.

"We could hang around for a while," suggested Orange.

"He mentioned the library at the University of Ottawa," I said. "Why
don't we walk back to Rideau Street and see whether we can meet him
coming from that direction?" This was agreed to and we set out.
We did not meet him.

When we arrived in front of a fast food restaurant there, Orange
said, "I guess there wouldn't be any harm in us having supper now,
while we wait."

I smiled. "I suppose that you expect me to pay for it."

"I left home without my loonies and doubloons," Orange said.

"Can you afford it?" asked Blue.

"Well, we'll have to be careful what we order," I said. "I've only
got enough so we can eat, not enjoy a mayor's feast. This place is
probably our best bet. There are better restaurants close by, but
none more in keeping with a student's budget. Also, if we choose a
seat by the window we may see him walk by."

"Unless he's taking the bus," said Orange.

"Don't ask how," I began, "but I've an impression he's on foot,"
"However, if I'm wrong and we miss him, then he'll be home after we
finish here and get back to his place."

"Since you're the resident here, I'll trust your psychic receptivity
on this," said Orange. I could see Blue nodding her agreement,
though there was a very concerned look on her face.

I ordered two hamburgers and two orders of fries to share among the
three of us. We went to a table that let us have a view of the
street.

"Here, Blue, as promised," I said with a smile, "is a typical student
meal in this city and many another hereabouts."

"Delighted at the opportunity, and especially with the company," she
said returning the smile. This led to a conversation about healthy
eating and other related topics such as exercise and avoidance of
cigarettes.

We actually had quite a leisurely and pleasant meal as we waited,
with decreasing hope, to catch Kevin walking by.

"I assume our wait has just about come to an end," said Blue as she
finished her last French fry. It was already getting dark.

I nodded. "I guess we head back to his place," I said. "I think
there's a chance that we may have to consider some very imaginative
ways of getting in touch with him." I was obviously suggesting that
we might have to use magic.

The others did not reply. They were busy, as was I, trying to figure
out how best to track him down with the least blatant use of
extra-terrestrial magic.

Again we walked by the park, which brought another chilled comment
from Blue, and made our way to his building. I could feel my mind
beginning to form an image of him. I called on my knowledge of the
correspondences of the earthly qabalah and the aethyrs of John Dee
and reached out for the feel of Kevin.

"He lives up there," I said pointing.

"There's no light on in his window," Blue said.

"Maybe he's sort of asleep, you know," said Orange. It was obvious
that he meant that Kevin might be in some kind of trance, possibly
busy with an astral projection.

"Maybe," I said, "but I think it's a bit early for that."

"I wish we could be sure," Orange said.

"Orange, have you got that book? Is it the ILIAD or the ODYSSEY?"

Blue nodded.

"I'm pretty sure it's the ODYSSEY, but I'll check," he said. With
that he pulled the Key of Tanaranth out of his backpack. We recited
the appropriate verse so softly that we could barely hear ourselves.

"I sure hope this works," projected Orange. "Now let's have a look
inside that room."

"What about wards?" I asked.

"We can use Kinarl's spell on friendly arrival," suggested Blue
"We're allies after all."

Orange and I nodded.

"Let's still try to cloak this as a Terran operation," I projected.
"Here's the related passages in Enochian. I believe they can be
fitted into Kinarl's spell in the following manner." I projected the
visual to them.

"Beautiful work," projected Blue.

"Impressive, especially at such short notice," projected Orange.

"I'll be honest," I confessed. "I was afraid it would come to this
the first time we were here and I've been energetically composing
this ever since. You two may have had the pleasure of conversing
with his ghost, but I've been studying and expanding on the Enochian
stuff for the past six weeks."

"Yes," projected Blue. "However, don't sell yourself short. For one
thing it was your positive interest in him that had gained his
attention. Otherwise, frankly he may not have appeared to us on our
arrival."

This brief interchange had given us a moment to move a bit further
into the shadows.

At once our minds visualized the harmonious patterns of the spell
most likely to allow us past any psychic defenses Kevin may have
activated against any unwanted occult visitors. We vibrated the
mental sounds that went with those mental images, taking care to
use the special angelic language recorded by Dr. Dee. The spell
required less than a second to perform.

Then, at once the three of us were standing in Kevin's living room.
As we had noticed from outside, there were no lights on in the room,
nor any others in the apartment. Still, we instantly noted all there
was to note. Each of us mentally filed all the details of the
furnishings of the room, including the fantasy posters on the walls,
and the titles of each of the many books, mostly magical or SF and
fantasy, on his bookshelves.

We took a moment to verify the most important detail, that as we had
feared, he was not at home.

"I'm not picking up any sign that he was here since early this
morning," projected Blue.

"You're right," agreed Orange. "What do you say, Green, would be a
good object to use as the focus of a spell to locate him?"

I quickly gazed around the room. Almost anything would do. However,
something especially close to him would give us a stronger tie. The
spell would then have a higher probability of working and of doing
so quickly.

"A book," I suggested, "especially something magical. He had his
journal at class today, but how about other magical notebooks?"

"What about this?" projected Blue, indicating some well thumbed
notebooks off a shelf. She read a notation on one of them, "An
enumeration of GD members, including magical mottoes."

"Perfect," I replied. "If we're lucky these will guide us straight
to him. Here's my Enochian rendition of the standard spell for
finding a friend, Kasalan 395, modified for the present situation."

"Green, you and I are going to have to have a long chat after this
is finished." Again I felt one of her telepathic smiles.

"It will be a pleasure," I smiled back.

"Ready," projected Orange.

We all were ready. Our three minds instantly linked, touching the
strong impression of Kevin's contact with his notes on the Golden
Dawn, and then tried to make contact with him in this precise
temporal point.

"Wow," I projected, "is that ever strong interference."

"Do we back off, or do we persist?" asked Orange.

"I say we proceed," I answered. "That interference is probably a
sign that Kevin's in trouble. Hold the Enochian uppermost in your
minds."

"We're not going to make it," projected Blue.

"How about Kassalan's spell for finding an ally in trouble?" asked
Orange. "I think that ought to break through the interference.

"Green, can you cloak that as a Terran spell?"

"Conabor. I'll try. That's my magical motto."

"Yes," projected Blue. "And it's all yours. We'll follow and feed
you." I read her thought and agreed.

I could feel our three minds embracing the matrix of the spell. My
physical body breathed deeply, as my mind filled with the wonderful
complexity of this spell. I could see the symbolic images of
verdure, flowers and a star spangled sky. I could sense the
symbolism of our three plumed phoenix streaking through the sky
above the city. Our minds drew closer together and I could feel the
immense speed and power of our plunge from high up down through the
clouds, the web, the shadow separating us from our ally.

There was a brief moment when the cloud seemed to become as hard as
metal, when the web bulged as if it were a trampoline, when the
shadow strove to become as thick as the planet. However, the force
of our triple plumed phoenix's dive carried us right through these
obstacles.

We were in a park, and at first I could not perceive anything out of
the ordinary. The shield that was hiding him from us had simply
withdrawn a ways, so that instead of blurring where he was in the
city, now it was hiding his whereabouts in the park. Had we not been
as accomplished as we were, we may have assumed we'd been
misdirected in coming here.

"It's a pretty sizeable place," projected Blue.

"Dow's Lake Park," I projected. "I have an idea where he is. Let me
try going there. Also, I agree with Blue. Let me try this alone. You
feed me energy along this serpentine path." I projected into their
minds a qabalistic diagram. Then I stepped forward across the grass.

It was amazing to see what lay in front of me, or rather to notice
what I couldn't see. I knew that there should be some trees here
quite visible. They were very tall and formed a neat circle which
was held to be of magical significance. There must be a very strong
cloaking spell in place to keep me from seeing something that
prominent.

I could sense my friends beginning the activation of the energy
transfer along the qabalistic diagram. The diagram took shape in my
mind and Blue and Orange poured out their life force to support me.
It took about three seconds to complete the spell. I found myself
staring at the tall trees, which were just where I thought they
should be.

I could also see that I was far from alone in the park. I could
see a number of others there. This was no ordinary coven, even if
such did meet here at more ordinary times, for them. It was more
than the failure to meet the stereotypical number. Yes, here were
not thirteen, but rather ten people. Nine of those people were
dressed otherwise than how one would expect in a modern city, even
if they were attending a traditional magical ceremony.

Long black fur cloaks, the hides of fierce predators native to a
planet a hundred and twenty parsecs away, clung to their shoulders.
Long red phosphorescent stalks, carnivorous vegetation from the same
world, rose from their level palms to contribute to a quivering
gloomy glow over the area. Compounding the eeriness of that
illumination were glowing hunks of rock reposing on their clearly
non human craniums. Then with a shock I realized that this was pure
element 88 and quite inimical to normal Terran life. A substantial
amount of energy was going into cloaking the surroundings from the
normal effects of such material, but then these guys had energy at
their disposal. 

The alien sorcerers, for such they clearly were, were slowly
circling the ring of trees. They had only eyes for the trees, or
rather the person within that circle of trees, the tenth person I'd
just discovered at this spot, the one I'd come to find, my fellow
student, the Terran adept, Kevin. He was standing at the centre of
those trees, a globe of flickering greenish light surrounding him. I
could tell from that flickering and from the weary expression on his
face that he was at the threshold of his endurance. They edged up as
close as they could to the trees protecting him without actually
touching the trees.

They were all facing inward, intent on his verdant bubble of will
power. I could tell at once that Kevin had been forced to raise that
to defend himself. In addition, the trees themselves were a most
potent defense of light and on another level, they kept at least a
couple of the members of that encircling group from easily
witnessing my approach.

One of them drew an object from inside his cloak. It looked like a
jewel or a small stone. It began to shimmer. It now seemed to be a
coin. With a start I realized this must be the fake doubloon,
possibly the dreaded Talisman of Yam Nahar which Blue feared more
than a nuclear arsenal.

"Fool," the sorcerer telepathically hurled at Kevin in deliberately
distorted English. "You can only delay the inevitable end by
crouching there in that spot of so little power."

Kevin didn't reply except to mentally shake his head.

"Don't you know who I am?" the sorcerer asked. "Don't you recognize
me? Are you not the dream meddler, the only native of this planet to
have survived witnessing the effect of my arrival on this world? Ah,
but then you found my incompletely formed features too overwhelming
to behold, even in a dream." There followed a visual replay of the
dream's climax and then the scene shifted to reveal what the dream
had mercifully kept concealed.

I felt Kevin's mind trying to become a closed door.

He could not keep out the other's probing taunts. "Now, here I am in
the flesh, and not just I alone. We are nine against one of you,
when even semi-materialized I alone was able to consume four humans,
who knew as much magic as you do, which is to say none."

Kevin's mind now seemed filled with the image of a wall and then an
enclosed cube, a great protective safe.

"Do you think that will work? I'll show you the true power of
darkness. Here is something even greater than I am. This will get
you out of your pitiful shell." He projected a thought to the
talisman he held. However, he was startled by the response.

"Fool," came the talisman's rasping thought in no language of this
world. "Not yet. First, you must drag him from those sickly trees.
Then you must separate his miserable head from his worthless body.
Then you use me for the absorption of his miniscule soul."

The chided sorcerer placed the artifact back inside his cloak. Then
he made a gesture with his left hand.

Now he and the others started to move with more enthusiasm. The
tempo of their swirling circling dance began to pick up. So also did
the speed of their wildly flailing limbs. They seemed utterly
oblivious to any possibility of dropping their living candles or
clumps of radium. They swung those carnivorous stalks as a drunk
might swing his bottle. Or perhaps this is not exactly the correct
comparison. For, it was not in any random and purposeless directions
they were moving their legs, arms, torsos and heads. They had a
precise and determined pattern to all of their apparently haphazard
gyrations.

As one after another those black robes struck the moonlight at just
the right angle to permit me a clear sight of them, one after
another revealed to me that they too were a part of this demoniacal
motion. The cloaks were not a plain and simple black. Rather,
thinner than threads of gossamer, crimson lines shimmered upon them,
crimson lines that failed to remain stable and static, but chose
instead to weave, wind, twist and gambol about those cloaks. Aye,
symbols they formed as they thrashed about like serpents, symbols
suggesting an earlier age, a completely unwholesome epoch, or at
least a world and species not yet risen from conditions all
civilized cultures consider earlier and unwholesome.

I watched for a moment that pattern with a horrid fascination. For
the briefest fraction of a second I was again aware of the two
other minds linked with mine. Not one of us failed to shudder, for
not one of us failed to recognize those sinister symbols, that
diabolical writing writhing on the cloaks, squirming out the
progression of a most powerful magical conjuration. We knew well
enough the origins of those sinister letters, letters from no
alphabet invented by human beings. And what they formed, the spell
they strove to cast was the like of nothing this planet had
witnessed in its billions of years of existence.

This confirmed all too clearly that this was no ordinary sabat, not
even one by the most depraved of earthly satanists, experimenting
with the most sinister sorcery of a terrestrial demonology. No, this
was nothing as harmless as that. These entities were no more human
than the gargoyles carved on the older buildings of this city. They
were servants of all that is opposed to the light.

My train of thought, as instantaneous and lightning swift as it was,
was interrupted. Their pace picked up again. They were dancing, or
rather gyrating, swirling, flailing, faster. They were arriving
close to the end of this preliminary portion of the conjuration. Now
they were contorting, with their feet tracing symbols, even as were
their carnivorous candle clutching hands, and the serpentine
swirling scarlet lines on their cloaks, spun as fast as the mad
dervishes of the East.

"If they finish this, Kevin is dead!" I projected.
