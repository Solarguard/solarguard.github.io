Chapter Thirteen Acquisition

At once the several kilometres separating us from the waiting
telepath had shrunk. We were at least in the neighbourhood from
which that call had come. We stood on a suburban sidewalk.

"Well?" I asked. 

Blue shook her head. "Now I'm not getting anything at all. It may
simply have activated a cloaking spell."

"Okay," said Orange, "let's just take a little stroll along this
pleasant sidewalk."

"Agreed," I said. We began to walk. We had not removed our cloaks,
though these items were veiled by Enochian magic so they would
appear to any observer to be just ordinary t-shirts and jeans.

"That sure was a close call," said Orange.

"What was it?" asked Blue. "I'm not sure we've seen anything like
that since the web in the forest." She clearly mean since the time a
portal had opened into our world some fifty thousand years earlier.
Actually, our planet had experienced several such incidents, of
varying severity, the most recent of which had been then. Here and
now, once again, we were taking care to guard our words and shield
our thoughts.

"Yes," I agreed. "The thing may not be a web spinner, but I think it
shares a lot of characteristics with the arachnids which troubled
the woods then."

"Does it come from the same place?" asked Orange.

"If not, one quite similar," I said. And I recalled what I had
observed of its home world, so strange to one born in this ordinary
universe. It had been a very brief glimpse, one very fragmented and
probably that was just as well for us. It seemed that much of the
order and science we took for granted did not work over there.

The three of us had been walking slowly, regaining some of the
energy we had spent so lavishly in our desperate struggle to protect
this city from a danger even the police could scarcely imagine.

Suddenly, Blue stopped. I did, too. Now I could feel it. Somewhere
nearby was an enormous magical field, shielding someone whose power
had to be extraordinary. Orange continued on a pace. "Wait!" Blue
commanded.

Orange stopped and then stepped back to join us. He nodded. We still
refrained from telepathy. Detection is sometimes a sporadic and
haphazard thing. Here we were wearing rings whose magical potency
exceeded the imagination of any human adept, and yet, in part due to
built in cloaking features, these rings likely would be completely
undetected. And yet, after our recent experience, we were not very
confident we could attempt a brief telepathic exchange, without that
being picked up. So, we tried to behave as normally as our garb now
appeared.

Yet, as the other two scanned, with their physical eyes, our
surroundings, which seemed no different from any other suburban
neighbourhood, I could feel the intensity of the thing growing. It
almost felt as if it were exerting a spell against me similar to the
force of repulsion which separates magnets of the same charge.
However, that was strangely unlocalized and abruptly my awareness of
it ceased.

"Whoever this person is," pronounced the Wizard of Blue. "He must be
very strong. I think his energy is really largely concealed and
we've just been picking up the excess overflow."

"I wonder who he is?" asked the Wizard of Orange. "Is it another
black fly or something from the same part of the woods?" He meant
was it from the same dimension. "We're at a significant
disadvantage," he continued, "if the thing becomes aggressive, if we
continue chatting away in English." He was asking what we thought
about switching to telepathy.

"Forty two percent," said Blue.

I understood exactly what that number meant, as it precisely
corresponded to my own assessment of my energy reserves. Still,
Orange had a point. "Well, I think we can use any language in the
world we want," I said. "I could even try reciting something in
Hebrew about spending one hundred and twenty one sheckles for the
eighth sphere. If I don't seem to be doing well enough at it, you
can show me how it's done, even use any other language you like."
For the briefest instant they considered my suggestion that I use
Enochian to cloak a specific mental probe and if I got into trouble
they could leap to my assistance dropping the guise of being Terran,
if necessary.

"Okay," projected Blue. "I think it's risky, but you're probably
well advised to take the risk. Go for it."

So, I threw my psychic awareness out into the night, determined to
trace the location of that powerful adept. He was quite likely
inside one of the few houses in the immediate vicinity.

I could detect normal human presences, but I could not pick up any
indication that some inhabitant of one of these houses had any
knowledge of the occult. I shared that datum of information with the
other two, who agreed that this was alarming.

"We didn't feel anyone leave by magical means," projected Blue.

"We didn't notice any helicopter or whatever whisk him away by
normal means," projected Orange.

"How about a reconfiguration of that location spell, so that I can
also pick up objects?"

"It was clearly a person," projected Blue.

"Maybe," teased Orange, "it was just the image of a powerful magic
user, say in a crystal ball. Maybe, there's a whole coven of witches
spread throughout the neighbourhood, but they all went out to the
movies together an hour ago. And just now someone called long
distance in the crystal ball, but there was only the answering
machine to take the message."

"I'm glad," projected Blue, "that you have not lost your sense of
humour. I must confess that I find it less easy to crack jokes just
now."

"Me, too," I projected. "Let's go get it." I could feel their two
minds very close to mine, as I tried to uncover that mysterious
adept or psychic object. Suddenly, I became aware of someone trying
to resist the probe. However, I persisted. Then quietly he gave up.
Instead, there came a very intense psychic attraction.

"He thinks he can defeat all three of us," I projected.

"To blazes with this distraction of concealing our identities,"
projected Orange. At once, he was fully and unmistakably a wizard
from our homeworld. I felt Blue's shrug as she joined him in
dropping the illusion of being Terran.

"No difference," I projected. "He feels he can best three
Gvihlih-hihn wizards."

"Well, let's show him what he's up against," projected Orange.

"Agreed," Blue and I projected simultaneously.

Once more a wizard rose through the air of the nation's capital,
followed by another and yet another. We arrived just outside a
house. There were people inside there, and we felt that not only
were they not behind this, they didn't know that within their house
lay...the Talisman of Yam Nahar!

Ah! Now he knew why this had appeared to be so powerful, and perhaps
why there had been some confusion as to whether we picked it up as a
person or as an artifact. I could tell that it was still mostly
cloaking its physical location as well as its paranormal ability.
Then it struck.

The very instant I realized what it was, I found myself thrown to my
knees. I forced myself to my feet. I planted those feet firmly,
determined that I would not be forced down again, nor driven back.

Suddenly, a horrific gale seemed to arise. I noted how the leaves of
the trees nearby did not sway in that very strong wind. This meant
that it had to have an occult origin. And along with the gale came
an almost overwhelming sensation of the darkest despair. This leaped
straight into my mind. How could we possibly prevail? We were so
very few in number. Yes, we had some magical knowledge and power.
Still, even with all our power, could we really believe we could
prove a match for the greatest of the black magicians, demons and
others so well qualified in the occult, who drew their strength from
a dimension so much superior to anything we could imagine? Had not
one of the smallest and least significant of the dwellers of that
dimension already proved that it was the equal, if not the superior,
of all three of us? What then could we hope for against an ordinary
dweller of that dimension? What could we hope for against any
reasonable number of them? What could we hope for against an army of
them led forth to battle by their all powerful ruler?

This despair which began to parade through my thoughts was not
native to my mind and I knew that very clearly. I struggled against
it with all my mental resilience, even as I struggled with my
physical might to resist the material consequences of its attack, I
felt myself beginning to fall backwards and stuck out my arms to
steady myself. I slowed the pace of my heart which had begun to race
abnormally fast, for no other reason than this entity or pseudo
intelligent artifact so desired it to beat.

Now I knew what I must do. I willed my hands to do more than merely
strive for balance. At first, it seemed an age passed and I was no
closer to my aim. And then the first stroke had been carved. It hung
there in the night air, a brilliant shade of green. It seemed that
single stroke of verdant light urged me on to more, helped propel me
to complete the glyph. Soon three more strokes were carved and the
complete character hung there as a shield, as a sentinel of all that
is held dear.

The glyph grew and formed itself in three dimensions all around me.
It covered me with the aura of a verdant wood on a distant world.
Within it could be scented the purest water of the most sacred pool
on my native planet, and perhaps the galaxy. And on the shore of
that pool rose our tower of light, our seat of the guardianship of
our people.

Armoured with this protection from our own world, I propelled both
my body and my spirit through the spaces separating the atoms of the
wall of that house. For a few microseconds, I was aware of the
subatomic composition of both the wall and my physical body. I could
feel the meshing of those particles. I concentrated on bringing
every single one, which belonged to me, along with me, undisturbed
by this unusual, though not impossible, passage. Is it any more
implausible than the astronomical fact on the macro level that two
galaxies have interpenetrated and passed through each other with no
adverse effect to the stars of either?

After that very brief period of transition, I found myself standing
whole and complete in the living room. Barely another microsecond I
spared to sense, with my heightened psychic awareness, the location
and nature of the various furnishings and even human presences in
that living room.

I felt the awesome might of that which had attracted me here. I
could clearly sense that it was down below me. Once more disdaining
to use the door, I passed through what the unlearned call solid,
this time dropping to the basement. That bottom floor of the house
was finished and indeed looked quite appealing. There was panelling
on the walls and tiles on the floor. However, I was interested in
only one thing.

It lay on a bookcase against a far wall. Just a simple doubloon it
seemed. However, I knew that it was more than that. I could feel it
crouching there, torn between its desire to spring at me and its
wish to conceal itself from the light glyph with which I had
enwrapped myself.

I moved across the floor relentlessly, irresistibly, as once I had
moved across the grass towards a circle of trees and the nine black
cloaked sorcerers it had commanded there. As I reached for it, the
talisman became more like a ball than a coin, pulsed with a black
light, if one may so describe it, and thrust itself up towards the
ceiling.

Calling on the vast mental energies stored in my ring of power,
carving in the air other sacred symbols of my people, I suddenly
held a large leaf of the badarn tree. With this I took hold of that
dark shadowy globular object crouching there.

"Fool," it rasped, "you do not know what you are doing." I could
feel its mental anguish as it strove to thrash its way free of my
grip.

Its shape changed again. I could feel it growing longer, wider,
bulkier. The badarn leaf still enclosed it. Try as it may it failed
to achieve greater dimensions than this largest and most magical of
leaves from my native forest.

Ideas and visuals assailed my mind. There was the image of a great
sorcerer holding aloft a massive tome, a book so ghastly the memory
of it terrified the ages. There were flickering flashes of episodes
through the generations of people cowering from this book and its
dark potential. There was the final bit of information, the ultimate
revelation. This talisman which had been residing on Earth for most
of the past twenty five centuries was none other than the disguised
and concealed form of Zandala's Grimoire, the greatest grimoire in
the galaxy, the most powerful black book, inasmuch as it had
independent will. It could confront me even in the absence of the
sorcerer who had created it, or of any other intelligent life form.

"Artificial intelligence," I thought and it read my thought and
laughed.

"What do you know, ignorant fool?" it hurled at me.

"I know," I projected, "that it's a darn good thing I've got you
wrapped in a badarn leaf."

It took this as a challenge. It possessed enormous bulk, for a book,
which it sought to use in slipping free of my grasp. It became so
warm that were it paper it may have ignited itself. It became so
cold that were it water it would have turned to ice. Had an ordinary
man or mage grabbed hold of it, even with both hands and protected
by an ordinary large leaf, he would have been compelled to drop it,
to release it, so that in the next instant he would have found
himself bound to it.

However, I was not an ordinary man, nor even a common mage. I was
Green, one of the seven rays of light, that form the rainbow. With
a leaf of the most sacred tree in Ay-yar's realm, I held fast this
terrible tome. My mind moved swiftly through the magical
permutations necessary to proceed with this volume outside.

"Blue, Orange," I projected, "I've got it, but it's taking almost my
full concentration."

"We haven't got it's atomic or subatomic structure," projected Blue,
"and it is likely unhealthy to attempt casually to obtain this."

"Which means we can't take it through the floor and wall," projected
Orange. "We'll open the doors for you."

"Many thanks," I projected.

"Unlocking a door and opening it is less work than pushing the atoms
of one's body around the atoms of the wall and floor," projected
Orange with a mental laugh, which he ensured was picked up by this
far from ordinary book.

And as swiftly as possible, and for a period shorter than the
dwellers of Earth imagine possible, the outside door, the door to
the basement and again the outside door of the house stood open to
permit my passage with the most potent and evil grimoire in the
known galaxy.

"Now," projected Orange, "let's have a look at it. Let's see whether
our prize catch was really worth so much trouble."

In the most guarded fashion, our three minds reached out to probe
it. The most interesting thing we noted about the book, even before
we had an opportunity to scrutinize it carefully, was that the thing
seemed endowed with rational thought and malefic purpose. Our
grimoires, or records of magical notes and recipes, are simply that,
ordinary books, save that their contents are extraordinary. This
large book, at least a metre long by five sixths of a metre wide by
a sixth of a metre thick, written on no natural paper, whatever it
might contain receorded upon it, was itself a rational being, or at
least a pseudo-rational one.

"Well, well," projected the Wizard of Blue. "Are we so inconsiderate
of our guest's feelings that we're trying to read it outside? I
think it's best we satisfy ourselves with what we already know for
now and wait till we're comfortably inside before proceeding." What
she was saying was very clear, despite the levity in her tone in
expressing it. I could tell that both she and the Wizard of Orange
were concentrating a lot more on their protective glyphs than on any
attempt to conduct a serious probe of the nature, purpose and
contents of the Grimoire of Zandala.

"I agree," I projected, "that we had best get this little item to a
hospitable place before reading it." Already our three minds were
grappling with the problem of how best to transport it and what
would be our best destination. We pursued the various possibilities,
considered the alternatives, and decided it would be easiest to move
it through the air at a very rapid speed to the place where the
three of us were now staying.

Barely two minutes later, we were sitting around the table with our
prize before us. We eased our collective thought down towards it,
letting our minds hover just a centimetre away from it. The Wizard
of Blue backed by us plunged further, warded by the greatest psychic
shields we could erect.

"Ah!" she exclaimed mentally, and we perceived instantly why she had
made that exclamation. We had discovered that this entity was more
unusual and more frightening than we had imagined. The powerful evil
sorcerer, Zandala the Black, had not simply penned here, with
however foul an ink on however odious a paper or parchment, the
glyphs of power permitting the use of sorcery, black magic and even
the invocation of demons. No, the book was far more despicable than
that. This accomplished and skilled adept had decided to take a
portion of his black and vile soul and embedding in it many of the
most frightful sorcerous things he knew, he willed this portion of
his own astral self to assume the shape of a dark and evil tome, the
very book that lay on the table before us.

"By all the powers of Light!" exclaimed Orange, "I never knew such a
thing was possible.

"What I want to know," projected Blue, "is what in the worlds can we
do with it?"

"I'm not sure," I replied. We were all more than a little nervous,
for the instant we had discovered the grim and awesome nature of
this book, our three minds had been attempting to answer that very
question. We were not, however, arriving at any easy solution of
this problem. It went beyond the ethical sense of whether or not
this book was for all intents and purposes a real person, or even a
portion of a person. Had we the person of the sorcerer himself in
our hands, we would not hesitate to confine him, for the crimes he
had committed and to protect this world from those he intended to
commit here.

Yet, it was the feasability of that confinement, the possibility of
locking up this thing, so that the minions of the dark one could not
get their hands on it, that presented us with such perplexity. We
began to wonder whether it was beyond our capacity. Short of
transporting the thing to our home world, where there were ways we
could deal with it and places we could lock it up, there seemed no
place we could put it and feel even moderately sure that it would
not on its own slip out and start hunting for other servants of the
dark one. And how practical or possible was it for us to transport
it from this planet to our own? Were we not restricted to carry it
between points in physical space? It just didn't seem very feasible
that we'd be able to get it home.

And then the thought came to all three of us that this feeling of
complexity and implausibility was more contrived than actual. It was
another example, as the earlier wave of dark gloomy depression had
been, of its tremendous ability to influence our thoughts and
feelings.

As we attained this realization, a slight degree of relief swept
over us, for now, we could isolate those thoughts of our utter
inability to handle this unique book in one corner of our minds, and
proceed seriously with the issue of dealing with it.

"Let's," I projected, "place this book in the middle of a wizardly
circle, still wrapped in that badarn leaf, and using the fourth
variant of Kinarl's spell for transportation of injured or incapable
animate objects, move it to the Tower of the Wizards."

"That sounds like a good idea," projected Orange.

"I agree," projected Blue.

We could sense that the book was quite surprised and displeased that
its attempt to influence our thoughts and resolve had faltered and
failed.

"We ought to be alert to any opposition its allies or underlings may
cause," projected Blue, and I was aware of her trying to analyze the
probability of the book receiving the aid of those we had confronted
at the circle of trees, of them trying to stage a rescue.

"Somehow that doesn't feel right," projected Orange.

"Yes," I added. "It's very likely that they've already been dealt
with on their home planet, if not in an even less attractive
location. We have the watcher spell at the one interdimensional door
we didn't close. And we used enough magical energy to close the fake
squirrel hole. I can't see them just flinging these or any other
doors open without us getting some warning."

With all our psychic senses fully alert, we began to run through the
spell activating the wizards' circle. Usually this was used for the
protection or for the healing of an animal or person who didn't have
magical ability. It would, however, also work very well to imprison
this baleful entity.

Was there some trace of precognition in our discussion about a
rescue attempt? If so, our apprehensions fell far short of the
gravity of the situation about to thrust itself upon us.

Even though we had so discounted it, we still had a microsecond of
warning. This was because the book could not completely conceal its
elation from us. It was so thoroughly delighted. We sensed that
sudden thrilled elation. We read its exhilerated realization that it
was about to be spared the transfer to our, for it, undesirable
world. And still we were not prepared for what transpired.

As swift as thought we cast our triune mind around, trying to see
what had so excited the book. We reflexively tested the wards we had
around the apartment, activated some additional general protective
glyphs and readied ourselves for whatever action we might be called
upon to undertake.
