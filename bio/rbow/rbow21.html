Chapter Twenty One Darkness

Beneath us stretched the leaves of the jungle in Amazonia. We could
detect the astonishing variety of life thriving here, the so many
different species of insects, the profuse vegetation, the other
animals and even people. Yet, neither here nor anywhere else within
the tropics all around the planet was there any sign of the thing we
were after.

"Could it have gone to Mars?" asked Orange.

I sensed Blue reply with a mental shrug. That struck her as
something that would only be tried once. Still, we sent two of our
number, Orange and Yellow, to check out the Red Planet, while Blue
quickly beamed an update of our situation to Indigo. Almost at once,
Orange and Yellow were back to report that Mars was calm and
undisturbed.

"Maybe it's taking some time to get to Mars?" projected Yellow.

"Why?" asked Blue. "We can get there quickly. The others from its
dimension can do likewise. Why should it be any slower?"

"Yes, but look at what happened to those pterodactyls," projected
Violet.

"Well," suggested Blue with some hesitation, "even though it will
take a bit of energy, I suppose we could increase the intensity of
our permanent probe." There was something to this thought, but the
feel of the issue was against it.

"I believe," projected Yellow, "that this thing will pop up again on
Earth. I feel that it's going through time to through us off its
track. I wonder how long we'll have to wait to have that confirmed."

"I suspect you're right," I projected. "It's cooking up something
else and using time to its advantage."

"I could be wrong," projected Orange, "but I feel it's not gone for
long. I don't sense any deep respect for us on its part. It may not
even have altered anything in response to us, but be following a
prearranged plan."

This thought was barely expressed before we felt an unnatural shadow
appear in the Andes Mountains. This carried with it a psychic aura
that can be compared to the drop in air pressure before a major
storm. There assailed us, although we were about twelve hundred
kilometres away from it, such a sense of sudden psychic dread that
we nearly fell out of the sky.

"What by the Light is that!?" projected Yellow.

"Let's go," projected Blue. At once, we appeared over that spot in
the Andes.

"There it is," projected Violet. On a mountain slope below us, there
lay a patch of shadow.

"I'm reaching for it," projected Blue. I felt her mind stretch out
with the visual of a torch blazing bright. The visual of a lake
appeared and the torch sputtered out.

"Fishing time," projected Blue, along with the visual of a thick
incandescent fishing line flung into the lake. This drew the reply
of an image of an ancient arrow bouncing off a modern Terran tank.

Then, again it was gone, vanishing from before our gaze, physical
and psychic. For about ten thousandths of a microsecond, we hung
there in some dismay. We continued to feed our life force to the
Wizard of Blue, who continued to use all her wisdom and insight to
track it down.

Then, with a thought of triumph she projected, "I have it!" At that
exact instant we moved, fast on its trail.

"It sure is leading us on a mighty chase around this planet,"
projected Yellow. "Where is it going now?"

"We've arrived," answered Blue. At once a vision of almost unearthly
beauty came into my mind and the minds of the other four wizards. I
saw such splendid icy mountains towering tall as eclipsed in beauty
even the southern range on the planet of Gvihlih-hih.

"Where are we?" I asked. For the briefest of instants, I believed we
had come into Tibet, though really the mountains were not that tall.
Then it occurred to me that we had followed it all the way to
Antarctica. My first thought was that this was a good thing. If we
could battle it there in that least populated of Earth's continents,
the possibility of innocent bystanders getting hurt would be greatly
reduced. I did not fully realize what it was we were up against, nor
could I conceive what it intended.

We had carefully appeared several kilometres from where we had
detected it. Somehow the psychic ether seemed to be shivering there.
Even our physical senses were having trouble. The atmosphere
appeared brittle and fluid, as though several layers of film were
superimposed on the same spot. Then, faster than called for by the
normal laws of physics, a thick mist or fog appeared out of nowhere,
and thrust itself straight at us.

Instinctively, we vanished and reappeared on the other side of it.
At once the fog stopped. It changed direction and headed right at
us. We caused a wind to intercept it. The fog moved against the
wind. We rose to a height of several kilometres. The fog followed,
increasing its speed.

We visualized a large whirlpool pulling the fog back to the ground.
We also activated a shield spell. The wall we erected was designed
to keep out anything. In addition each of us caused to appear over
our bodies a fully functioning space suit, air tanks and all.

It was a good job that we went to such elaborate lengths. The fog
raced upwards ignoring the deflection spell. When we dropped back
towards the surface it came with us. Then it breached the mind
shield, a very potent one in the magical repertoire of our people.
However, against the material space suits it could do nothing. It
simply billowed around us.

"I'd like to know the chemical composition of that cloud," I
projected.

"Well," projected Orange, "Red's the colour most learned in
chemistry, but then he's not here, and I'm supposed to know a bit
about the weather. I guess it's up to me to make that reading." As
he was sharing this thought, he was forming and projecting to us a
list of the various molecules making up the cloud. This was followed
by a molecular diagram of one of them.

"Ninety nine per cent of that cloud is benign," Orange explained.
"Only one per cent of it is composed of that molecule. However,
that's ten thousand parts per million, when ten parts per million is
lethal."

"Let's send the lethal stuff into space, where it can't harm
anyone," suggested Blue. We all agreed with her proposal and we were
unsuccessful when we tried to implement it. With a mental shrug, we
moved in the direction of our adversary bringing the cloud with us.
When we arrived about twenty metres from the distorted space within
which it lurked, the cloud suddenly vanished. This was an impressive
display of the creature's power.

The air around our quarry was still strangely translucent, verging
on opaque. We fed more energy to Blue, and felt her sending out her
probe. Instantly, we all became aware of a heavy rasping sound, as
though a bulky animal were breathing.

"I think I'm finally seeing something," Blue projected. The rest of
us soon saw it, too. Now we knew precisely where it was, though we
still couldn't very clearly ascertain any details of its actual
appearance. The shape before us seemed to be constantly wavering,
like a haze in the air of a scorching afternoon.

"I wonder," asked Orange, "why this time is different? If it doesn't
want us to glimpse its real mishapen form, why doesn't it just
assume another fabricated appearance, like the rabbit and porcupine
it used before? Why is it going to all this bother with fluctuating
the visibility of the air?"

"I'm receiving the vague mental reading that it's still attempting
to assimilate the ways of this dimension," replied Blue. "I believe
that it's trying to exist here in its proper shape, but the
differences between the two realities are so great, that the result
of that is the flickering we see."

"That," projected Violet, "also explains these flashing colours."
One aspect of the apparent wavering of reality around that entity
was the constant flashing of colours strangely inconsistent with the
normal wavelengths of our universe. This added to the unpleasant
sensation one got from trying to look at it. I was reminded
unpleasantly of the flashing magic squares and Abramelin demons.

"Let's treat this as we would a normal cloaking spell," projected
Blue. "We can make the following modifications for this situation.
We may not get much, but at least we'll have a static shape to deal
with. This spell will also, if we're lucky, give us a hold on its
perception of its true self." She at once visualized a spell matrix,
which we allowed to fill our minds and wills. There were three
aspects of our effort to break through all the obstacles between us
and as clear a perception of its true nature as perhaps anyone in
this reality could obtain. These we mentally equated with three
normal implements, and activating these correspondences we acted.

Our psychic will wielded in order a crowbar, a pair of scissors and,
finally, a sword. This last was the most potent symbol of the
magical will in more than one solar system.

There was enormous resistance. The crowbar slipped out of our mental
grasp, turned into a slithering crystal serpent and disappeared
beneath the white surface below us. The scissors twisted away from
us, grew wings and flew off over the horizon no slower than the
speed of sound. However, the sword proved harder for our adversary
to handle. We gripped this firmly and slashed through the entity's
concealment, both that caused by the natural incompatibility of our
two universes and that resulting from its determination to resist
our spells. With a growl and a roar, it realized that we could
perceive it.

It had definitely cast aside the shapes of rabbit and porcupine.
Now, it could read from our thoughts that its intent to convey
symbolically its awesome speed, invulnerability and power had not
really worked against us. Its understanding of what our kind found
impressive was growning clearer. However, this time it must have
attuned its thoughts to mine alone, perhaps because I was the only
one who had come from this world. It seemed, to our amazement, that
despite all the energy and will we had placed into our psychic
attempt to see it as it really was, it was still able to adorn
itself with a shape, which suited its fancy.

What lay there, so relatively close to us, this entity capable of
cloaking itself from five of the most accomplished occultists in the
known galexy, looked a bit like a holographic dinosaur. It didn't
seem to matter that the tropics would be a more fitting environment
for such a great reptile. As we had seen, that was by no means the
least incongruous thing about it.

"Why would it take the shape of a dinosaur?" I asked.

"I see," projected Violet. "So, this shape has some significant
meaning on this planet." Quickly, she and the others read my
thoughts on the origin and symbolism of dinosaurs.

"If such prehistoric giants roamed our world," projected Yellow,
"then they left no fossils behind them, at least none that have
survived into historical times. It would be interesting to know
whether it read about dinosaurs only in Green's mind, or whether in
its rapid circling of the planet, it picked up the thoughts of other
Terrans."

"There is another possibility," projected Orange. "Perhaps this one
or another of its kind has had previous contact here, even as long
ago as the millions of years needed for it to encounter these giant
reptiles."

"Maybe," I projected, remembering how those black flies had taken
the shape of pterodactyls.

I could sense the others agreeing with our analysis.

"One more thing," I added, "the reptile is often associated on Earth
with the mythical ruler of the underworld."

"Ah, is it?" projected Yellow, and I could feel the rest of them
following that line of thought.

"Seventy four per cent probability," projected Blue. I didn't know
how she came up with that figure, though it seemed somehow her ring
had made the calculation. I could feel that the other wizards were
impressed and my own ring hummed a bit and sent me the thought that
while it hesitated to provide an exact number, unless I requested
such, the thing likely was what Blue suggested. I realized that the
other wizards were a little awed at the prospect that loomed before
us. One by one a tension rose within them with their growing
suspicion that we were truly confronting the most powerful of all
the dwellers of that other dimension. The word, "Kaylooree," came to
the surface of my mind supplied by my ring of power.

The instant that this word arrived at the surface of our minds, the
great saurian began to roar. During the several seconds of that
roar, it launched a massive psychic attack against us. This began
with its confirmation that it really was the ruler of the Pit, whom
the people of the planet of the wizards called Kaylooree. In its
tongue it had a different name, which had a more pleasing
association in its estimation.

"Yes," it projected at us, "I am the one you call Kaylooree." In
thinking this, it was using the thought patterns peculiar to a long
dead dialect of the northernmost language on Gvihlih-hih, a dialect
we considered defiled by the sorcerers who had used it to compose
prayers to Kaylooree and spells to permit this emperor of demons
access to our planet. "I am the most glorious ruler in existence. I
am the one, who is now extending his rule to this miserable little
planet. However, this world is but a beachhead, a stepping stone, to
the conquest of this entire dimension."

"This dimension is fairly large," projected Yellow, using the
symbols of the most melodious and sacred of our dialects and
languages.

I felt Orange stilling his mind and sinking deep within himself to
reach across to our world and alert Indigo to the declaration of the
entity and to our conviction that such was really what threatened
Earth and the rest of the universe. Even as Kaylooree sent us the
telepathic visual of himself shaking his massive reptilian head, two
more wizards appeared in the sky above snowy Antarctica. We could
feel the great dinosaur raging, annoyed that it had failed to drive
us away instantly, that it had, on the contrary, attracted two more
of us. A sense of awe arose within us. This was the first time in
many millennia that all seven colours of our rainbow stood arrayed
together to defend against the darkness. It was the first time ever
that we did so on another planet.

Our initial move in this contest was our visual of the immensity of
space here and the magnitude of the number of the stars and even the
large number of galexies to be encountered. It was too much to hope
that this by itself would dissuade the ruler of demons from
proceeding, but it was a start.

"Also," I projected, recalling one of the barbs of a previous Wizard
of Green against some thantay galarat'ha, "time moves at a different
rate here from what you are used to. In no time at all, you will be 
touched by the fingers of mortality that are an aspect of this
place."

It snorted derisively. "Do you think that I came here unprepared? Do
you think that you alone are able to extend your miserable lives? Do
you think the human sorcerer Zandala is more capable of remaining
alive than the one he called master? Why are your opening moves so
very weak? Yet, how can it be otherwise, when you are contending
with the Lord of the Pit himself?"

With that, his mental attack, for such this was, became more
intense. He used a massive amount of psychic energy to hurl at us an
almost overwhelming suggestion of his might and power. Once again,
somewhat ominously, he proved he was informed enough about me to
treat me differently than the others. In the background of my
awareness, I could feel the thoughts my colleagues were receiving.
It suggested to them that in the dawn of time, when the forest god
had brought into being the first and the most powerful of the
wizards of Gvihlih-hih, three of them had died attempting to prevent
Kaylooree's entrance onto their planet, and the rest would have
followed suit, had it not been for the direct intervention of the
god of the forest. This time, on a distant alien world, that god
would not intervene and the death of all seven wizards was a
certainty.

However, as this alien reference had less meaning for me, he used an
Earth reference to try to overpower my will to resist him. There
came into my mind the image of a church, where a preacher was
speaking. With a start, I realized that he had pulled this memory
out of my own mind. Suddenly, the scene became as vivid now, if not
more so, than when I was a little boy, dragged to this undesireable
place against my will by my parents. There stood that frightening
man, his face contorted as he shouted a description of the flames
that awaited those who do wrong. There sounded on the ears of my
youthful memory the description of the ruler of the fiery abode.

Suddenly, the dinosaur, which stood before me altered its shape.
Now, the being in front of me was a replica of that terrifying ruler
of Hell, horns, cleft foot and all. The preacher's voice continued
to resound through my mind. He went on shouting about Satan. The
devil had snared the souls of most of the people on Earth, and
unless we were very careful, he was going to get ours, too. To my
youthful mind it seemed that the devil was all powerful. It seemed
that there was no way I could be good enough for God to concern
himself with me and save me from the wiles of the devil. Wasn't the
preacher saying that God had allowed Satan free reign as the prince
of this material world? Wasn't it true, then, in the unlikely event
that God chose to intervene, he would do so only on behalf of those
he considered righteous? There was no way I could imagine myself
one of that number. Was I not an atheist? Did my soul not already
belong to the devil? Well, now he had come to claim it.

I shook these thoughts aside. This ridiculous being would have done
better to hold onto his appearance as a refugee from the prehistoric
past. Dinosaurs at least were frightening, even though really it
would have done better to pick the tyrannosaurus rex as its model
with which to frighten an Earthman. Satan, however, was just an old
bogey man. Maybe he could scare that frightening preacher by putting
on a devil costume. He might even have scared me, when I was a
little kid listening to that guy in the church. However, now I was
an adult, and an atheist to boot.

Similarily the other wizards shook off the allusions from the past
of their planet.

"So," it snarled. "You find my form less than absolutely terrifying.
That problem can most easily be rectified."

At once, the feeling of distortion that had been around its shape
vanished. Now we could see it as clearly as we could see the bright
blue sky and the pure white snow. Only now it was not a survivor of
the Jurassic Age. Now it was the father of all the thantay, a great
black spidery thing with ten legs and four crimson eyes, each
glaring at us with an inimical intensity that almost drove our souls
from our bodies.

Instinctively, I immediately closed my eyes. I could feel that each
of the other wizards had done likewise. We seemed to realize that to
look at such a sheer hostile monstrosity for any length of time
could imperil our sanity, if not our very lives. Yet, even though my
eyes were pressed as shut as I could hold them, somehow, through
those closed lids, I could see a suggestion of what I was trying to
avoid. The black spidery form seemed to be burning its way into my
eyes and mind. I realized that I had raised my hands to cover my
eyes. Still, the awesome lightless shape of our enemy was shadowed
there.

I could feel it leap towards us. It was clearly hanging only ten
metres away, and since it was at least ten metres in diametre, the
sense of its proximity was absolutely overwhelming.

"What art thou?" came the psychic stench of its thought. My mind
seemed to reel beneath those soul searing thought forms. "What art
thou to snear at the lord of the living and the dead, of mortals and
demons? I am the master of all that exists." It had used the archaic
thou to indicate it was addressing me alone. And, truthfully, with
growing apprehension, bodering on panic, I realized that I'd lost
contact with the minds of my colleagues. That sense of isolation was
the most frightening aspect of the confrontation so far.
