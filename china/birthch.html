THE BIRTH OF CHINA, Herrlee Creel, Frederick Ungar Publishing Co.,
New York, 1937

This early work is very valuable in communicating the excitement at
the time of the relatively recent expansion of knowledge due to
archaeological discoveries.

There is a four page introduction by Carl Whiting Bishop of the
Smithsonian stating that now there is growing attention in America
to Chinese topics, that it is only lately that the early stages of
Chinese history have been known, and that this volume is a
comprehensive and readable presentation of up to date information.

The author has included a five page preface saying that while the
book is intended for the general reader it has been carefully
written in a very scholarly manner. The traditional mention of those
gratefully thanked for their assistance occurs.

Chapter One, "The Oracle Bones" (pp. 21-26), introduces the
realization by Chinese antiquaries  in 1899 that these medicinal
items contained the earliest forms of Chinese writing, the intense
thirty-five year study and decipherment of the inscriptions, and the
publication of some fifteen, of the more than one hundred, thousand
inscriptions. There is mention of the prevalance and quality of
Twentieth Century fabrications.

Chapter Two, "Excavation" (pp. 27-37), mentions respect for the dead
and the unsympathetic view of archaeological or other digging into
tombs, as well as the appearance of antiquities in Peking curio
shops, provenance unknown. It states that some thirty years elapsed
before digging began at An-yang in 1928. It outlines difficulties
presented by the weather and by well-organized and armed tomb
robbers. It mentions the spectacular excavations of 1934-1935,
including bronzes, sculptured artifacts and eleven hundred dateable
human skeletons.

Chapter Three, "Origins of Chinese Civilization" (pp. 38-53), begins
with Western assumptions that the Chinese or their culture migrated
relatively recently in historical times, and the finding in 1927 of
the remains of Peking man, considered a direct ancestor of modern
Chinese, indicating, perhaps, at least half a million years of human
habitation.

There is then mention of three Neolithic cultures, the earliest
possessing the distinctively li tripod. Then there is Yang Shao and
its beautiful painted pottery. Finally, there is the black pottery
culture. Mention is made of migrations from Asia to American. And,
reference is made to bronze supposedly introduced to China be
western invaders.

   There has been a definite tendency among Western scholars, and
   even among some of the Chinese, to represent the Chinese culture
   of the Bronze Age as having little direct relation with the
   preceding Neolithic culture. Some have gone so far as to conceive
   of a set of invaders from the West, coming in with bronze, horses
   and chariots, cattle, and an entirely new culture, settling down
   as the overlords of an enslaved Neolithic population, and
   becoming the historic Chinese aristocracy. Picturesque as this
   undoubtedly is, it finds little support from the facts as we now
   know them. p. 49

The recently uncovered black pottery culture with its cattle,
horses, divination bones, pounded walls, li tripods, etc. in the
Northeast is taken as refutation of the Western origins theory. In
addition there is mention of influence, including rice, from the
south. Early legendary accounts are taken as fictitious, though some
place known as Hsia is believed likely to have existed, although
attempts to identify it with archaeological sites have not yet been
successful.

Chapter Four, "The Great City Shang" (pp. 57-71), begins with the
founding of the city c. 1,400 B.C. and the advantages of the site.
It proceeds to pounded earth construction, quotes from the Book of
Poetry on the founding of a city, mentions the dimensions of
ninety-two feet by twenty-six feet for the longest Shang hall
hitherto uncovered, states the Shang had polychrome painted walls,
explains the original character for capital as a gate with a tower
behind it, and notes the excavations at several Shang settlements.

Chapter Five, "Livlihood" (pp. 72-94), begins with the staples of
agriculture supplemented by hunting. It mentions the warmer climate
of the times and the presence of bamboo and elephants. It proceeds
to the various species whose bones have been found at An-yang:

   dog (two kinds), bear (two kinds), badger, tiger, panther, whale,
   common rat, bamboo rat, hare, tapir, horse, pig (two kinds),
   sheep, goat, ox, water-buffalo, elephant and monkey. pp. 75-76

There is reference to East Asian, Indo-Chinese and Malay avoidance
of milk and the alleged absence of epic poetry from cultures
avoiding milk. There is considerable discussion and rejection of the
theory the Shang had recently been pastoral nomads. There is mention
of the predominance of millet, though wheat and rice are mentioned
in the oracle bone inscriptions. Men are said to have tended the
crops, and women prepared food and looked after silk cultivation.

The use of cowrie shells as money is considered.

Chapter Six, "Handicrafts" (pp. 95-105), begins with the perishable
nature of many artifacts. It looks at Shang textiles, as evidenced
in inscriptions, at weaponry, at ornaments, jade, bone utensils,
wall paintings and the use of horns, antlers and tusks. Then comes a
bone musical instrument found in a Shang tomb in 1935. It is a
hsuan, two and a half inches high. Wood, largely perished, and
pottery come next, with the observation that crude glazing is found
on some Shang pots.

Chapter Seven, "Sculpture and Bronze" (pp. 106-125), begins with the
very recent excavating of Shang sculptures, their high quality and
the even more impressive Shang work in bronze.

   If the Shangs excelled in their sculpture, they did so even more
   markedly in their casting of bronze. The best of the Shang bronze
   ritual vessels are almost undoubtedly the finest things of their
   sort in the world; in fact, they are probably the most exquisite
   (in the proper sense of that much abused word) objects which men
   have ever created from metal, regardless of time or place. p. 108

Although bronzes had been found and removed from An-yang's soil for
centuries, and grave robbers had been especially busy for the half
dozen years starting around 1929, only in 1934 did scientific
archaeological extraction begin. Examination of three Shang bronzes
detected one part tin to five parts copper, as compared to the one
to eight or one to nine ratio more common elsewhere. They were
probably done by cire perdue process, and unsurpassable, as admitted
by modern metal workers.

The three kinds of vessels: ku, chueh and ting are mentioned, as
well as Western assumptions that Chinese bronze work and designs
must have a Western origin. However, recent uncovering and dating of
Shang artifacts suggest the Scythians, for example, would have been
borrowers, rather than initiators.

Chapter Eight, "Shang Society" (pp. 128-131), begins with family and
ancestor worship. While an aristocracy is likely, definite evidence
for it has yet to be determined. There is reference to polygamy, to
sacrifices to female ancestors, to possible tatooing of slaves, to
concubinage.

Chapter Nine, "The Shang State" (pp. 132-140), begins with its
extent and the influence of belief in Shang ancestors in the
authority of the Shang dynasty. It is suggested that the various
other states mentioned in the oracle bone inscriptions were largely
self-governing. Even so, the author posits an area of only forty
thousand square miles for the Shang state, noting that Chinese
archaeologists believe it was much larger.

Chapter Ten, "War" (pp. 141-157), begins by challenging the
impression that China was more peaceful than other areas of the
globe. It states that as far back as can be known there was war in
China. It looks at Shang horn bow, feathered arrows, the dagger-axe,
armour, bronze helmets (excavated for the first time in May 1935)
and chariots, quoting from the Tso Chaun to underline the importance
of chariots (generally three man: driver, spearman and archer), and
the command chariot (including commander, drum and flag) in Chou
warfare. The suggestion is made that Shang chariots were less
significant, though still providing vantage observation and mobility
to commanders.

Chapter Eleven, "Writing" (pp. 158-173), begins by rejecting
simplistic Western assumptions of the primitive nature of Chinese
writing. It notes the highly artistic sensitivity of the Shang and
states:

   In fact, every important principle of the formation of modern
   Chinese characters was already in use, to a greater or less
   degree, in the Chinese of the oracle bones, more than three
   thousand years ago. This has been one of the most surprising
   revelations of the recent discoveries. pp. 159-160

The vocabulary has increased from some twenty-five hundred
characters to a modern seventy thousand characters. Grammar and
style have evolved, but the essential principles already existed in
Shang times. While earlier stages of the writing may not be
uncovered because of the perishable nature of the materials used,
the Chinese practise of communicating in writing with the ancestors
was likely influential in the early use and development of writing.

There are several pages where the author uses a sentence to
demonstrate principles of Chinese writing. The existence of now lost
Shang books is mentioned.

   But in Shang times there were written books, many of them. We
   know this from the occurrence on the oracle bones of the word
   'book', written ##) This character is still in daily use. The
   verticle lines are strips of wood or bamboo on which the
   characters were written in verticle columns. The horizontal lines
   joined by a loop represent a piece of cord with which the strips
   were tied together and kept in proper order. When not in use the
   whole 'volume' could be rolled up and laid away. Actual Chinese
   books of this variety, some two thousand years old, are still in
   existence, but we have none as old as Shang times. p. 172

Chapter Twelve, "The Gods of Shang" (pp. 174-184), begins with the
importance of the ancestors. There is mention of an excavated Shang
cemetery with some of the skeletons lying prone face down, a
practise used in India to prevent the spirit from wandering. Modern
practise of burying articles of poor quality with the dead is stated
not to correspond to earlier grave goods of very high value and
considered well-placed, as ensuring the favourable assistance of the
ancestors had a high priority.

There are ghosts and spirits and deities such as 'The Dragon Woman',
'Eastern Mother', 'Western Mother', 'King Wind', 'Below and Above'
and 'Ti'. This author expresses uncertainty as to the meaning of
this word and of 'Shang Ti', though the opinions he provides include
that of Supreme or First Ancestor.

Chapter Thirteen, "The Counsel of the Gods" (pp. 185-196), looks at
oracle bones and divination. There is mention of tortoises
sacrificed and further smeared with blood from a sacrificed bull to
endow them with the sanctified potency to communicate with the royal
ancestors. There is description of cracking the shell by heat, the
known names of some diviners, the king at times divining himself,
and a dozen categories of topics of oracle bone divinations:
sacrifices, announcements, banquets, travel, hunting and fishing,
war, crops, bad weather, good weather, illness and recovery, the
coming week and miscellaneous.

Chapter Fourteen, "Sacrifice" (pp. 193-216), begins with the concept
of offering food to the recently departed, of the essence of the
food being consumed by the ghost while the physical food remaining
could be of use to the living. There was sacrificial burning and
spilling liquid on the ground, libation. There were ancestral
temples. There were likely the seasonal sacrifices of the
agricultural cycle. There is a dispute as to whether the word fa
meant human sacrifice or, more benignly, referred to a dance. The
arrival in the Peking antique market of explicitly decorated
headmen's-axes incline the author to believe in human sacrifice, a
topic treated at length in the chapter.

Chapter Fifteen, "Who Were the Chou?" (pp. 219-226), begins with an
appreciation of the accomplishments of the classical period. There
is the claim that the Chou were barbarians. There is the
geographical identification of their homeland as the Wei river basin
in Shensi. There is consideration of the Shang and the Chou
contributions to the civilization of the Chou dynasty with the
author concluding much of it came from the Shang. The Chou traced
their ancestry to Hou Chi, a legendary character who appears to have
been a corn god.

Chapter Sixteen, "The Chou Conquest" (pp. 227-236), begins with Wen,
the Accomplished King, who during his seven year reign, greatly
extended Chou rule in the west. His son, Wu, the Martial King,
awaiting a time of Shang weakness, struck with a large force. A
decisive battle ended Shang rule, and the last Shang king committed
suicide. Continuing Chou conquests and the allotment of various
lands to relatives and allies resulted in a feudal structure. Among
those receiving a fief was the son of the last Shang king. He had
two brothers of the Martial King to assist him and keep him from
thoughts of rebellion. By this means, the Martial King allowed
sacrifices to the Shang ancestors to continue, averted the perhaps
vengeful response of Shang spirits and perhaps even gained the
favour of the departed Shang kings.

On the death of the Martial King, his brother, the much lauded Duke
of Chou, ruled as regent for the Martial King's son, until the boy
was old enough to assume power in his own right. He founded the
eastern capital of Lo-yang.

Chapter Seventeen, "Political History" (pp. 237-245), notes the
lessening of Chou royal authority with the passing of the
generations, the settling in of the fief holders and their
increasing independence from the royal court. There were also
external pressures. The oppressive King Li is mentioned and the
revolt he caused. The Duke of Shao preserved the royal heir and King
Hsuan eventually came to the throne. There is the telling of the
story of King Yu, who to please his favourite concubine, Pao Szu,
needlessly sounded the alarm, ensuring, of course, in time of need
the lack of response to the alarm, and the consequent fall of the
western capital to the barbarians in 771 BC. The dynasty continued
from Lo-yang, though its power had diminished so greatly that it is
the rivalries of the other houses, the theoretical subordinates of
the Chou, which are historically significant. Even there developed
the concept of pa, first assumed by Duke Huan of Ch'i, that of the
pre-eminent duke making decisions beyond his own territory and even
resolving disputes within the royal family.

Chapter Eighteen, "Archaeology" (pp. 246-253), begins by stating
that Shang archaeology is much more advanced than Chou archaeology.
There's reference to recent digs at the suspected tombs of the
rulers of Wei, and to a bronze of the Peking antiquities market
inscribed with the name of the first ruler of Wei. There's reference
to standard phrasing of different types of grave goods in allotted
quarters of tombs, hence the finding of tombs only plundered on the
north as the grave robbers had gone straight for the ritual vessels
placed there. There's mention of the upcoming excavation of Lo-yang
and the author's reconnaisance of tombs attributed to early Chou
historical figures such as the Martial King and the Duke of Chou,
tombs still receiving pilgrims honouring those ancient and eminent
personages.

Chapter Nineteen, "Literature" (pp. 254-275), begins with the extent
of Chou writing, even in the early years of the dynasty. It mentions
evidence for the literacy of all aristocrats and the influence of
writing on state affairs. It explores at length inscriptions on
bronzes. In early Chou times expensive bronzes recorded significant
events, information to be treasured by descendants. Also, one
conveyed in bronze inscriptions one's respect to one's ancestors and
sought their beneficial spiritual influence. While bronzes may often
provide a regnal date, they often omit to identify the king. The
style of characters did change over the centuries. Some of the
inscriptions were brief and some were longer, a hundred and even
four hundred characters in length.

Then comes a look at early texts beginning with the I CHING, a text
whose lack of simplistic clarity is what Herrlee Creel most
underlines. Next is the SHU CHING, DOCUMENT CLASSIC, not at all a
history and not really a collection of documents from as great an
antiquity as claimed. Then there's the SHIH CHING, BOOK OF POETRY.
He notes that Shang praise odes actually come from the Shang
successor state of Sung. There is deep emotion amongst the 311 poems
in THE BOOK OF POETRY, quoted a number of times throughout THE BIRTH
OF CHINA. The TSO CHUAN, TSO CHRONICLE, is described as a very
important source. It covers the years 722-468 BC. The Kuo Yu,
Discourses of the States, is not held to be independently reliable.
The I LI, BOOK OF CEREMONY, conceying to more ordinary aristocrats
how to behave on important occasions, also informs the modern
scholar as to how such events were expected to be conducted. It is
noted that translations of these works are heavily influenced by the
lengthy line of commentaries on them.

Chapter Twenty, "Chou Society" (pp. 276-288), notes the development
of upper and lower classes with no evidence in the skeletal remains
of differing racial origins. Due to the need for self defence some
men specialized in fighting and governing.

   Being fed, clothed and sheltered by others, they had time to
   develop elaborate ceremonies around such details of their life as
   coming of age, marriage, and sacrifices to ancestors. They had
   time for elaborate banquets and archery contests in which the
   commoners could take no part. The advent of books and writing
   made a still greater difference, for the ordinary peasant had
   neither leisure nor opportunity to cultivate these. Finally we
   have two extremes: the commoner, a ground-tilling clod who knows
   nothing but his labour, his rustic merry-makings, and the
   occasional fighting for which he is conscripted; aristocrat,
   wearing fine clothing and eating fine food, skilled in archery
   and charioteering, accustomed to command, schooled in an
   elaborate etiquette, able to quote verses appropriate to any
   occasion, smooth, polished, sometimes witty. As different as the
   poles, but for all that we need not assume they are descended
   from different ancestors. pp. 279-280

The absolute authority of the immediate superior is mentioned and
the lack of any right of appeal to his superior, the recourse to
rebellion or to flight, and the consequent depopulation of the lands
of the very oppressive. Merchants and artisans are mentioned, as are
women, generally held to be inferior and with nothing to contribute
to governing, though there are accounts of men who prospered by
following feminine advice, as there is reference to men suffering
because of taking women into their confidence.

Chapter Twenty One, "Marriage" (pp. 289-300), mentions that
marriages were arranged and notes the ceremony in the I LI: the
divining as to whether the marriage was auspicious, the meeting of
the chariots of bride and groom, the descent from the chariots,
ceremonial greeting, groom's driving the bride in her chariot as the
wheels turn thrice, the groom then returning to his chariot which
leads the way to his home, the nuptial feast of bride and groom,
their night together, and then the bride's morning greeting of her
new parents. It took three months for her to become a full member of
the family. Divorce was possible, but generally marriage was
understood as being for life.

There was polygamy with its attendant imperfect harmony. There are
several pages of quotes from THE BOOK OF POETRY on marriage and
romance.

Chapter Twenty Two, "The Family" (pp. 301-309), begins with the
extended family living together, the absolute authority of the pater
familias, the intrigues occasioned by polygamy and concubinage, the
great influence of an old dowager and filial piety.

   Filial piety is the chief of Chinese virtues. It is at once the
   social, the political and the religious duty of every individual.
   For the family is the unit of society, and filial piety is its
   bulwark. The father is the prototype of all political authority,
   and disobedience to him would threaten the foundations of the
   state. The relation of the child to his parents and his
   grandparents is like their relation to their deceased ancestors,
   and the service and support which he gives them are like the
   worship and sacrifices which they pay to the dead. p. 303

One important aspect of filial piety was revenge against the killer
of one's father or brother. The author quotes from a recent (1933)
newspaper article stating the assassin of a general was pardoned on
the grounds he was avenging the death of his father and uncle.
Regretably, this concept caused the extinction of noble families, as
a ruler feeling compelled to execute one family member did not wish
to hazard his life to others duty bound to seek vengeance.

Chapter Twenty Three, "The Business of Life" (pp. 310-318), begins
with the importance of agriculture for farmers and the nobles who
depended upon them. Mencius' "well" field system is  referred to,
but the author doubts its actual, rather than ideal, existence.
Writers and scholars came from the aristocracy, as did teachers and
religious officials who depended on nobles. There were merchants,
craftsmen, physicians.

   The goods which merchants carried must have been chiefly
   luxuries, such as articles of clothing and food, which could not
   be procured everywhere with equal ease. Salt, fish (dried
   undoubtedly), furs, cloth of various kinds, and silks are named
   as articles of trade. p. 316

There were roads, inns and tariffs.

Chapter Twenty Four, "The Enjoyment of Life" (pp. 319-331), begins
by comparing the pleasures of the mediaeval European happily
watching the snow fall through a slit in his stone castle with the
literary early Chinese noble in comfortable and exquisite residence
or pavillion sensitive to flowers. Both hunted, had tournaments (The
Chinese were very keen on archery), feasted (There is a page long
list of different ancient Chinese foods under the headings: Cereals,
Vegetables, Fish, Meats, Fruits and Miscellaneous) and enjoyed
music.

Chapter Twenty Five, "Religion" (pp. 332-345), begins with the
expressions on the bronzes for continuing descendants sacrificing to
one's spirit, for long life, for protection, for good fortune, for
continuation in office and for wisdom. There was divination,
including oracle bone and I CHING. There was sacrifice, with, it
seems, a greater focus on grain than had been Shang practise. There
was the young person infused with the spirit of a departed ancestor.
There was the importance of the ancestral temple, increasing
according to the greater rank of the family concerned. There was the
mound of the deity of earth and grain. There were temple officials.

There were also shamans, Spirits were thought to dwell above and
below. A number of incidents concerning ghosts are recounted. There
were spirits in rivers, on mountains, at crossroads. The supreme
deity was Heaven, it seems a Chou divinity who was equated with
Shang Ti. The Chou kings called themselves Tien Tzu, sons of Heaven.

Chapter Twenty Six, "Law" (pp. 346-356), begins by noting that the
supposed complex bureaucratic nature of early Chou governance owes
its origin to the ideals of the Eastern Chou officials and
philosophers attributing their highest concepts to a time that was
actually feudal and relatively simple. there is discussion of the
attitude that better than legal codes subject to literal legal
technicalities was the discretionary authority of competent judges.
The complete authority of a local aristocrat is reiterated. Also, is
the situation of family and clan handling of many matters.
Punishments could be severe.

Chapter Twenty Seven, "The Official Class" (pp. 357-366), states
that this reaches far back into early history, notes the similarity
with the modern British civil service, mentions the classical
education which equipped the scholar for so many generations to
administer China. It mentions their education and their composition
of decrees for their influence:

   But the chief reason for the triumph of the scholars was that
   their doctrines really worked out in practice. They said that
   honesty was the best policy, and they proved it when they were
   given a chance to do so. They declared that oppression and
   tyranny on the part of a ruler were sure to bring his downfall,
   and they could point to an impressive number of cases in which
   it did just that. They claimed that their policies, if put into
   operation, were capable of bringing the largest measure of
   success in the long run, and they demonstrated that it was true.
   p. 361

Kuan Chung is mentioned and his advice that Ch'i return conquered
lands, thereby ensuring the friendship of its neighbours, and
recognition as the Chou dynasty's leading vassal state in 667 BC.
The humanitarianism of the scholar officials is noted, based on the
power of the people, the main body of the army, and, unlike peasants
in mediaeval Europe, able with their bows to pierce the armour of
aristocrats. Also noted is the stabilizing support of humanitarian
policies and the natural human heartedness of the normal human
being.

Chapter Twenty Eight, "The Decree of Heaven" (pp. 367-380), mentions
this concept that a monarch ruled in order to benefit his people and
that Heaven could replace him if he failed to do so, the traditional
view that Hsia and Shang dynasties were thus replaced by Heaven,
though oracle bone inscriptions do not confirm the traditionally
negative view of the last Shang ruler, more likely the victim of
Chou propaganda.

There is some discussion of the sincerity of scholar officials in
striving to benefit the people, and emperors accepting
responsibility for such things as natural disasters and asking that
the people be spared. There is the concept of China as the Middle
Kingdom, the civilized centre of the world. There is the summing up
that the basis of that civilization had been fairly well established
by 600 BC.

This popular scholarly volume from sixty-five years ago remains a
splendid look at the enthusiasm of contemporary archaeological
discoveries and a worthy introduction to ancient Chinese
civilization, culture and society.
