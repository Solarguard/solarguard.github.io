Greetings.
    If you are well, it is well.
    There follow below some unofficial notes of the second spiritual
traditions gathering. These are not an exact and complete record, as
at times the scribe was too intent on what was being said to move 
the pen, and some of the marks made by that hasty pen seem a bit 
like dream writing, you know, the dreams groggily written down in the 
midddle of the night when you're too tired to get up and turn on the 
light. Still, I hopes this will provide those who couldn't make it an 
idea of how the evening went. 
    May those who read find interest and enjoyment here.
                                                    Fare very Well,
                                                        Michael

Unofficial Notes of 2nd Spiritual Traditions Gathering held at Cafe 
Wim on the evening of September 30, 1997.
Present: thirteen of us, not counting the spider.    
Topic: Spiritual Paths.

What is a spiritual path?
    A spiritual path is a journey taken to develope our own 
spirituality.
    Often found in a tradition, Eastern or Western.
    Not necessarily a part of religion.
    Some group, some individual, some combination.
    Spirituality has to do with the individual.
    The fact that you are at pt A and have a goal, an actual end 
point.
    Is there an endpoint?
    The goal may shift, but ahead of you is the light at the end of 
the tunnel.
    The goal shifts as you're further along.
    Is the goal a truly attainable thing, or is it the journey.
Once you reach point B, then there's point C.
    Crossroads on the path. Could frequent choices be a necessary
part of the path or do all paths have to be a one way street? Not 
really making effort if not constantly making choices.
     How important? Very. Each choice makes you grow.
     Eventually an easy path will bring you back again. You can keep
taking the easy path, and keep going round in circles, or you can
take the hard one.
     Spirituality is acceptance or realization of a goal and a path 
is the self saying how can I best reach the goal.
     Spirituality not necessarily includes a goal. A goal could be
bettering the self. 
     I'll live my life to such ideals, and possibly learn how to
put these ideals into action.
     Daily itinerary. 
     The problem of spiritual itineraries is that they throw rocks 
at you a lot.
     Those who wait to be told what to do, and read from books, and
are told by priests. The sheep's path.
     Spiritual paths look like crazy spagetti intersections.
     How can one broaden a mind on the straight and narrow path?
     You might end up putting square pegs into round holes.
     Spirituality is belief inside or outside the self or both.
     Often paths rest on tradition. 
     How distinguish paths and traditions?
     A path is a road; a tradition is the vehicle you're riding in.
If you're on a bicycle and you come to a river, you have to adapt the
vehicle, change vehicles. Possibly a mega vehicle, a hovercraft.
     One goal is to find a mega vehicle.
     I'd think I'd rather upgrade. 
     No superpath A-B, do this ritual, or pray this prayer, and at 
once there's the Goddess sitting down to tea. 
     That's probably why they don't sell mega vehicles. 
     I'm going on horseback.
     If you're going 180 you miss the butterflies and run over some
squirrels.
     When you're going slower, you're getting there faster. 
     Going fast is against the purpose.
     The goal is not to get some place far away, but to find the 
true self. You'll miss it if you go fast.
     It's like a mobius strip.
     When looking for totem animals stay away from insects.
     Could a priest, guru etc. be compared to a mechanic.
     Depending on the faith to a used car salesman.
     Based on experience, use the scientific method. If success, 
move on. If it fails, discard the path or tradition. Only good, if
for you.
     Yet, don't throw the baby out with the bath water. Maybe a year
later something will confirm what happened, and if you've tossed out
the path.
     What you feel comfortable with. You take a cup of this and a cup 
of that putting together a personal thing. You need a certain amount 
of success, unless you have an immense amount of faith.  
     Elements from other approaches. How much can the defining of 
self be aided by others?
     A lot. I'm a shaman with a lot of books on Wicca. I like to talk 
about Crowley and Regardie. I add bits and pieces. I have my basis, 
my framework, like a basic car to which one can add all these 
accessories. As you go along you get more neat tid bits.
     There's the Baha'i idea of the history of spirituality. Each
religion leads to the next more knowledge is revealed. Baha'i is
the ultimate.
     Actually, they believe every thousand years there'll be 
another prophet.
     Then they're the ultimate now. that's sort of what I meant.
     It's like a cooking pot with everything thrown in.
     Baha'i is the best broad minded, the best monotheism around.
     We're always becoming, and it's always good to learn new things.
That helps you not turn into a one-minded sort.
     Defined beliefs to the self. Be constantly exploring for 
individuality.
     How do we define eclectic and solitary? 
     It's like in Hinduism. You have Jnana Yoga, the way of knowledge
with reading of the Vedas, etc., and Raja Yoga, the way of experience
of going into the self.
     Solitary is alone.
     Two years ago I came out of the broom closet. There were lots of
books and web pages, and learning about different things and finding 
it out for me. 
     The solitary has no labels for such things as drawing down the 
moon.
     A tradition has labels, but they may only apply to what's done 
there.
     An eclectic, really this is from all over, so it has the most
labels.
     How important are labels?
     Only if discussing things.
     Or if considering what are you.
     It's just impossible unless you follow a rigid path without
adding salt and pepper.
     When we get deeper into spirituality language starts to fail.      
     It doesn't matter if you call it a wand or a stick, a five
pointy thing or...
     Dabbler. I described myself to a Wiccan as a Dabbler. To a
Wiccan a Dabbler is one who pays no heed to the rules, who just
doesn't care. I meant I had my fingers in many pots and was taking
care not to get burned.
     I told someone I was just starting out, and he says, "Ah, so
you're a neophyte." In Wicca a neophyte is one who has reached the 
point of just being ready to start studying for the priesthood.
     A traditionalist is a specialist on a particular path, an 
eclectic is one trying all the flavours.
     Would you attain quicker, if not trying all the flavours?
     I'm eclectic. I have looked at many traditions. None were
particularly good for me. And so I put together for myself. If I
found something that really clicked then I'd be in that tradition, 
rather than by myself.
     If I hadn't found bits and pieces that worked then I'd be a 
solitary.
     There are energy factors in a group. There is the collective 
unconscious. The group after doing it so many times has fascilitated
the way for those who come after.
     The best thing about following a path with a rule book is that 
you are not doing this blindly.
     There's the danger of going along smelling the roses and the 
tulips and passing up the pomegranates.
     If Persephone hadn't eaten pomegranate seeds it wouldn't be
cold outside.
     There is spiritual discipline in a tradition.
     If eclectics throw it all together in an ill-defined mish-
mash, one danger is you can spend time navel-gazing.
     There is stronger belief in a tradition, as you know your 
beliefs are shared.
     There's a trade off. In a solitary or eclectic path, you need
more discipline.
     It's like sports. Some are ideally suited for individual 
sports. Some for team sports. Are you best suited for individual 
discipline or group discipline.
     A solitary can get burned by messing around, but also can take 
that extra step forward. Every time we eclectics add something new
we take a chance on blowing ourselves up or jumping ahead.
     Synthesizing from a number of traditions to make it your own.
     There is a difference between this and one happily pulling books 
off the shelves without reading the titles.
     In a tradition there is the benefit of being able to learn from 
others' experience and mistakes. A solitary has to learn from one's
own experience and mistakes.
     As a solitary you don't suffer under the pre-conceived notions 
of those who taught you. Also you learn at your own pace.
     You can start in a tradition and become eclectic or the other
way around.
     All traditions have different facts of some kind that you can't
go beyond. 
     You can assimilate stuff from different traditions.
     If it's this candle has to go here, and these words spoken with 
no alteration then it's becoming fundamentalist.
     That's like the rosary. You know once the rosary was a mantra.
Now it's the rosary.
     The idea of something working if you say the exact words etc.
even if you're not sincere.
     God will know if you don't mean it. 
     It depends on faith. As long as I say the words it will work,
if I believe.
     I know of some paths that are eclectic, yet assert that they 
are traditional. Why would a path want to insist that it's a 
tradition.
     More respect from mainstream reporters.
     Validation, that they be seen as The True Path.
     It's hard to sell something when it's only two weeks old.
     One reason for stories of old secret traditions when they are
not really old is that sense of belonging.
     The sense of belief is strong when you and others believe it's
something with richer past.
     It's like education. Queens has an established reputation. And
then there's Nippising College which has only been around for a 
handful of years. No one knows. Nippising could have some cool
programs, but you may want to take those that are sure rather than
untried. 
     The vast majority of us come from backgrounds claiming to be
the only right belief, old established ones. Well, now it's new,
but there's still the need for that crutch, until eventually you
realize that you don't need that crutch.
     Wicca only goes back 60 years.
     Even as an eclectic you think it's cool when you meet someone 
else who thinks the same way you do, to find someone who says, "No,
you're not nuts." There is still the human need for validation.
     In traditions paths are mapped out to a certain extent. Others
can recognize where you're at. Eclects gamble on roaming longer in
the dark or arriving quicker.
     There are road signs. Spirituality 15 km ahead, as opposed to
"Here be dragons." 
     Or "Fill in the rest of the map as you go along."
     You can take various cross roads 5, 35, etc. km.  
     You can follow their map, but not the route they've mapped out.
You can decide to take this side road.
     I've had some of the best rides in the country when I didn't 
have a clue where i was going.
     Or you can get out of the car and walk.
     Do you have to cover all the side roads?
     More set forms in a traditional path. You can focus and learn 
in greater depth, as opposed to wandering aimlessly. Or maybe you
can explore just one piece of territory.
     On a spiritual path you are exploring life.
     Like going from Halifax to Vancouver along the Trans Canada, 
is it possible to go down all the side roads in sufficient depth.
     Perhaps you keep going back and back not knowing you're there.
     I don't think there are this number of insights before you
reach enlightenment, like the 7 scrolls and the 6 sharp things you
need before you reach the castle.
     From the perspective of a tradition this has been proven to 
work, many people have found this to work for them.
     There is no one true path, only the true path for the self.
One size fits many, not one size fits all.
     Works for who and says who?
     Known to work in certain cases, and not necessarily for you.
     Applies to only part of the journey.
     You can cross the Prairies any way you want, but once you're
at the Rockies there's only about three good ways through.
     Some are into walking in the woods until they drop, others 
just going into their rec room.
     There may be only three ways you can drive through the Rockies,
but that's not all. You can go on foot many other ways.
     You can take the safe established road, or you can try your
own way.
     If you're in shape.
     If you're in a tradition, there's the temptation to get and
take only what the tradition says.
     No one does himself any favours taking one path his whole life,
excluding all others. It's to one's advantage at some point to try 
others and not get roped into what seems to work.
     Be true to the self and know when it's time to put down that
guide to the Rockies and take your own way.
     It's good not to be blinded. It's good to try different paths.
It's good to approach one path and try it for a while. There's a 
certain point at which you'll need to do exercises and have 
grounding.
     A person on a tradition may have this.     
     I'm more likely not to be hobbled by the way i'm taught. 
     What's the bare minimum. If you just pick up a guitar and 
whonk.
     Or go to a conservatory and learn in great detail.
     You need the basics, but how much do you need. If you try the
guitar, tuba, etc you have so many new elements you never focus on 
one.
     Each tradition out there started with one eclectic.
     The three levels of knowledge: doing, understanding, teaching.
     You may have a basic knowledge of ten instruments or you may
master one.
     It's what you want, a mastery of one instrument or a basic
knowledge of music.
     There are traps and pitfalls. If you're choosing a path decide
which risks and pitfalls you're willing to take and what benefits  
you want.
     Crowley, there's a full tradition on what this one eclectic
wrote. He was considered a kook in his lifetime. Now even eclectics 
look at him. Crowley is not mine, but he makes it work. Some pieces 
work for sure, others don't.
     Keep a journal.
     I have an angst book. Anytime I get pissed off I set pen to
paper. I now have four books full.
     A magical diary or whatever is a good way to monitor your
way.
     Most Wiccan traditions that I know of teach keep a Book of 
Shadows and put everything into it. It won't be all interesting,
but you won't leave anything out.
     Don't be intimidated by the blank page. Write as if explaining 
to a friend. 
     Why put labels on things. labels don't fit.
     A Book of Shadows presents secrets, putting things in terms 
others won't understand.
     I'm going to call that insight, "tintinnabulation," and use
that term every time that comes up.
     I don't explain Wicca or paganism to anyone who isn't one.
When asked, "What do you believe?" I say, "Uhm, I'll give you
the phone number of someone who can tell you what I believe."
     I say that I believe in deity, fire, earth, air and water.
     Nature stuff.
     Is it necessary to believe stuff or just have lots of maps, 
etc.?
     You have to believe in something, even if it's only the self.
     Everyone believes in something, intangible or tangible.
     You believe that your feet are going to touch the floor in the
morning.
     I hope that my feet are going to touch the floor in the morning.
     Until you experience something, before you experience it you
have to believe.
     If you don't believe in the Goddess you'll never experience.
     It's occassionally useful to take the agnostic's view.
     I believe this is possible or probable, and try to prove the
possible to the self.
     If you believe very strongly you will experience whether you
do or not. Whether it is true or not, self fulfilling prophecy.
     You'll never be sure whether it's real or a delusion.
     Where is the line between what's valid and delusion.
     Individual reality. 
     In the past these were called prophets and scribes wrote down
everything they said.
     Believe everything around you.
     When the little critical part goes completely away.
     You think this mountain can be climbed, you think, "I can do 
it."
     You also know that you can't do it without the rope.
     What's the definition, that this one has divine insight and
that one's a nut. 
     As long as this decision isn't made on the basis of who 
expresses himself better.
     Various levels of the myths. For example, in grade 9 we were
told the myths came because the ancients didn't have science. 
     Mythology is not just a bunch of stories. There are layers 
upon layers of allegories written and told in times past to explain 
why things happen.
     It's often a problem to explain a path to others.
     Every story does have a basis in fact. Vampires derive from
Vlad etc. 
     And from this medical syndrom which has one photosensitive
and photophobic, reclusive and drinking blood.
     The Great God Ranger. There was discussion how there is no god 
for modern warriors. Mars doesn't quite cut it. So they made up 
Ranger with magic words, signs etc, a long litany of rituals. The
next thing all these guys in the military are believing Ranger 
exists.
     What about Elvis and Diana?
     Man created Jesus in his own image. The most popular portrayal 
of Jesus is blond. If you read the Bible it's curley hair and bronze 
feet.
     There is the god Elvis. There are rituals to him. On his 
birthday and on the anniversary of his death there are pilgrimages.
There are rituals and ideals of what this man did, and altars to 
him.
     There is the spiritual function of Ranger. When you're in deep
shit you focus on him.
     Myths are useful ways of conveying taboos, cultural norms, 
history and nature to a degree and deeper psychological notions.
     But how many of the deeper psychology are original. 
     The Christian Bible has loads of practical ways.
     The myth os Sister Sun and Brother Moon. On the surface this is 
exploring eclipses. One level down it means no sex with siblings. 
One more level down it means don't force your will on others. 
     Do we need new gods, new books, new myths.
     Morals are out of date. Now we know our sun is a fusion furnace
and the moon rock. What does this tell us of morality. A lot of older
morality is out of date.
     Aesop's Fables. 
     Animals don't talk.
     They don't speak English.
     Next gathering two weeks from now, same place, same time.
