Gratitude to Goddess of Lake and Others

A fleet of ducks, a line of geese,
A sense of calm, a feel of peace,
A hint of wind, a touch of breeze,
A scent of pine, a sight of trees.

A lake that waves to me its "Hi!"
It seems serene. I stand and sigh.
Azure the sky, a sapphire sight.
Assure will I that thanks I'll write.

I breathe as soft as lapping lake.
I gaze amazed to be awake.
I'm here in tears that I arrive.
I'm grateful you kept me alive.

A vow to write your praise I keep
In awe, in gratitude I weep.
Allow I pray what now I do
To be very worthy of you.

Humanity's Birth

The blasts of bombs, our Mother in travail.
The bullets' din, an infant's primal wail.
The ship of life unfurls its maiden sail.

A wiseman's words abused, a toddler down.
A ranting rage of hate, a baby's frown.
A shriek for gold and oil, a tiny clown.

"It's mine!" a little child hollers aloud,
Demanding, forceful and instantly cowed.
The sun's splendour no baby cries can cloud.

A child is crying in the dark of night,
Afraid of all that lurks away from light.
Dispelled his fears as soon as brightens sight.

Not me, not mine, not them; its us and ours.
In earth's garden we are all her flowers.
She feels us all, gives all vital showers.

A world pregnant, a planet in labour;
A species birthing, Earth Mother's favour.
Let's all understand what's worth living for.
