Chapter Nine Repair

Barely a second later the four of us were standing several miles
away in the other park.

Kevin blinked and said, "Wow. I'm impressed. You guys are the real
thing. Thanks for pulling me to safety back there."

"Think nothing of it," I said.

"Blue, are you still getting anything?" projected Orange.

She shook her head. "The only impression I'm getting now is that
everything's normal, with just beneficial occult influence here."

"We won't so quickly accept that," I projected. "Let's check out
that gazebo."

We could see at several levels that it appeared to be quite normal.
Nothing seemed to be interfering with our view of it, either
physical or otherwise.

"Let's try walking a bit closer," projected Blue.

"That feels right," projected Orange.

"I don't see any distortion," said Kevin.

"We're going to check it out," I said. "I think it's still safer for
you to be with us. Just be careful. Watch where you put your feet.
Let us know at once if you pick up any strange mental impressions."

"You can count on it," he replied.

The four of us approached the gazebo together, walking cautiously to
the front of the hill upon which it stood. As we drew nearer to the
structure, I warily probed ahead with my psychic senses and I could
feel Orange and Blue doing likewise.

"When I moved here," said Kevin, "I checked into the history of this
place. It's quite fascinating."

"I know about the early cemeteries," I said. "I could find no trace
of any recent malevolent psychic activity here."

"Do you know that some of the locals refer to this gazebo as the
Witches' Tower? There's a local tradition that when Philemon Wright
came to this area from Massachusetts some two centuries ago, at
least thirteen witches came with him, and ever since that time, when
the moon is full, there's been a gathering at this spot."

Since my studies of local history had included the datum that
Philemon Wright had settled on the other side of the Ottawa River, I
thought at least part of what Kevin said to be of a rather dubious
nature. I decided this was not the time to share my scepticism.

"Interesting," said Blue. "I like the vibes I'm getting from this
spot. I can understand why you'd come here yourself for scrying,
Kevin."

"Uhm," he said, "thanks." His surface thoughts were aswirl in
confused feminine imagery. By this time we had reached the top of
the hill and were standing just in front of the gazebo. For some
reason, born in the unconscious, I halted and transmitted the image
of a raised hand.

"What is it?" projected Orange.

"I'm not sure," I projected. "Something has triggered an unconscious
defensive reaction. I don't seem to be getting anything, at least
nothing powerful enough to impede us. Still, there has to be a trace
of something to have triggered my defences, but a trace of what?" I
was perplexed.

"Don't worry," projected Blue. "Just relax. There's certainly no
harm in being cautious, considering this is where my kraken detector
led us."

"Wait a minute," projected Orange. "What's that? Yes, now I'm
getting traces of psychic energy, which I think is recent. I can't
confirm whether there's any malevolence in it."

"When was the last full moon?" projected Blue.

"Eighteen days ago," I projected, "though some circles gather for
the new moon."

"Let's not take any chances," projected Orange.

"Agreed," I replied. "I think we better take a really close and
careful scrutiny."

This exchange had taken place telepathically at such a speed that
Kevin, still absorbed in thoughts of attractive female adepts,
hadn't noticed it. When he tried to walk into the gazebo, I put out
a hand. Orange held out his hand from the other side. Kevin looked
at us with a puzzled expression on his face. "Are you getting
something?" he asked. "It looks normal to me."

"We're not sure," I said. "We're going to check this out carefully.
We're going to do a probe in the astral."

Kevin raised a brow, but said nothing.

"Okay," projected Orange, "which of you gets to do it? Blue, you've
got that kraken finder spell, but Green's just replenished his
energy."

Blue projected the image of the two of us strolling merrily hand in
hand along the seashore towards a fishing boat. "Green, would you
care to accompany me on a pleasant ride in a boat?" she asked. "We
could get in a bit of fishing."

"I'd be delighted," I replied.

"Good luck," projected Orange. "I'll keep a watch on Kevin.

"We better explain this to Kevin," projected Blue.

"Right," I replied. "Kevin," I said aloud, "Blue and I are going to
do this together. We're going to be standing here physically, but
our astral bodies are going to be carefully trying to check out that
gazebo. We're going to be completely preoccupied by what we're doing
and there's a chance that Orange may be forced to help us out. In
all probability the whole thing will only take a few minutes. We'll
be in constant telepathic contact with Orange. He'll be normal and
awake and able to tell you what's going on, though this astral
activity tends to happen a lot faster than words."

"Yes," said Orange with a laugh, "by the time I tell you there's
nothing to worry about, they'll be back to normal consciousness and
able to tell you that themselves."

"Glad to hear it," said Kevin smiling faintly in an effort to show a
sense of confidence he didn't feel.

Then, very carefully, Blue and I sent our psychic awareness right up
to two of the pillars, taking care not to pass into the gazebo
beyond.

"Kassalan's occult analysis," I projected, "seems like a good one
for this occasion." I transmitted the entire formulaic diagram,
including the Enochian envelope.

She quickly analyzed it and beamed her acceptance of her part of the
spell. In addition she projected the image of her cave and her own
strongest protective spell sheltering both of us.

"This should get us quick results," Blue projected.

"Be careful," projected Orange.

The detection of occult influence took place at once. Blue projected
the visual of somebody holding his nose. She had found an anomaly in
the air within the gazebo. She projected, "Ah, now that's remarkably
clever." I could sense her lightning swift analysis of the air and
was quickly absorbing her deduction that really there was nothing
physically wrong with the air here, even though it might seem that
way. It was more devious.

Had we physically entered the gazebo, we would have noticed what we
would have assumed was a closeness of the air. This perhaps at first
may have struck us as strange. The gazebo is not separated from the
rest of the park, so one would expect the wind to blow the same air
here as outside, especially at the top of a hill. Perhaps, as surely
the sorcerers intended, it would take a moment for us to notice the
mustiness, and even then we might decide it was completely
comprehensible, considering the reputation of the place as a site
for sabats and other gatherings of that kind, in which incense is to
be expected. If we had also noticed that there was the trace of
occult activity here, then the same reasons could justify this.

However, by the time we would have been more than aware of this, the
trap would have been sprung. The mustiness of the air was but a
reflection of the real problem here which lay on the floor of the
Witches' Tower.

Again our adversaries had been remarkably subtle and clever there.
That floor bore the marks of chalk precisely as anyone with any
background in Terran magic would expect. The chalk was the usual red
favoured by many Terran occultists, and had been used to depict the
traditional pentagram, replete with cabalistic diagrams and Hebrew
letters.

However, there were two layers of additional and far more sinister
glyphs in operation here. The first was another sketching in chalk,
one done in very thin lines and in a colour beyond the normal range
of human vision. The other, even more clever device had been the
alteration of the shape of the very stones which formed the floor of
the gazebo, so that the joining of those stones now resulted in the
formation of a Duranian hunting glyph. This glyph combined with the
one that had been drawn in the very lines of ultrviolet, beyond the
normal range of human vision, to produce one of the deadliest
magical traps in the galaxy. Anyone with even a trace of magical
ability and training on entering the gazebo would be psychically
snared and held on this spot until the sorcerers arrived to claim
their captive.

"It seems," I projected, "that they prepared this trap for Kevin,
but something took him into the park near Dow's Lake and they
decided they could catch him there."

"It is a little bit more out of the way," projected Blue. "Still,
why go to all this trouble and not make use of this?"

"Maybe," projected Orange, "we'll find out when we get Kevin's
account of what happened before we arrived."

"Right," I projected. "How about using a physical object to
neutralize the effects of the chalk lines?"

"I think a shoe would be a good object for this purpose," suggested
Blue.

"Good idea," projected Orange.

Blue projected the image of the two of us in a boat with the stars
agleam in the night sky. Then the constellation of the tree lilter
filled my whole mind. "If we must wait for the shoe," she projected,
"this is the best way to spend the time."

"The most romantic constellation in the sky," I projected. "I'm
happy to be with you, Blue. Maybe, when we're next at your cave,
we'll go for a boat ride with the constellation of the tree lilter
shining on us its assurance of bright days ahead."

I was aware of Orange explaining what was going on to Kevin as he
lifted my right foot and took my running shoe off. Then Orange
tossed the shoe into the gazebo.

"Good one," I projected. The shoe landed across the ultraviolet
line. Very alertly, Blue and I caused the shoe to move across the
floor.

"Nice try," projected Blue. "Too bad it didn't work."

She was right. My shoe had succeeded only in marring the cabalistic
designs drawn with normal Terran reddish chalk.

"Green," she projected, "what about a combination of the Great
Ashkaran Azure Octogon and Kinarl's 2.4?"

"Adapted to the ultraviolet," I mused, "and the altered stones.
That's a brilliant response. It'll take time to translate that into
Enochian."

"I don't mind waiting," she projected.

I processed the spells and my Enochian vocabulary, significantly
updated since the days of John Dee. When I was finished I projected,
"I'm ready," and beamed the diagrams to her.

"So much for your needing lengthy periods of time to fashion
Enochian translations for our spells," projected Blue with a mental
laugh.

"It's more an envelope than a translation," I responded.

"Green," she projected, "your humility is one of the things I like
most about you." Then she transmitted the image of the two of us
casting a fishing net into the sea.

"I'm ready," I replied.

Then, methodically and very carefully, we sent our psychic awareness
into the stones which formed the gazebo. First our minds rested near
the top of those stones, analyzing the substance of that invisible
design.

"How about this?" I projected along with a recommended altered
design for the ultraviolet glyph.

"It's lovely," projected Blue. "I don't think I recall it from your
notes."

"Maybe because it's Egyptian and not Phoenician," I projected with a
mental laugh. "Let's do it."

Arm in arm, astrally speaking, we unravelled the baleful glyph and
set the ultrviolet line in a new and completely different pattern.

"It's a pity," Orange projected, "that no Terrans will be able to
see your handiwork."

"They'll feel the beneficial influence of that indelible ankh, all
the same," I projected.

"That was the easy part," projected Blue.

"Be careful," projected Orange.

"We'll certainly try," replied Blue. "How far back should we try?"
she asked.

"First I'll try the night before the last full moon. If that fails,
I'll drop further back. Hold tight, Blue." I beamed the image of the
two of us gripping hands. Then my hand lengthened enormously as I
slipped back a full nineteen days into the past.

"I made it," I beamed through time.

"Way to go. Now get the recording."

Very attentively, I dropped into the stones. Astrally, I recorded
the totality of the gazebo's structure before it had been altered by
the sorcerers.

"I got it," I projected to Blue. I received the visual of Blue
giving me a hand from the water into our boat.

"Thanks a lot," I projected to her as I arrived back in the present.
"Now let's do the imprint."

"Gladly," she projected.

The two of us took the record of the gazebo's previous and wholesome
shape, as if it were a wonderful coral, and placed it back on the
ocean floor where it belonged. So did we feed the memory of the
previous pattern of the gazebo's stones into the present,
concentrating so exactly that what we projected into the present was
a precise visualization, right down to the subatomic level.

We could feel the shape of the stones shift, as the original pattern
swept over the sorcerers' handiwork. For a heartbeat we hung there
observing, analyzing and rejoicing that the effort had been so
successful.

Blue beamed to me an image of her hand tenderly holding a lilter as
well as its most melodious trilling.

"Congratulations," she projected.

"Thanks, but I couldn't have done it without you. The only thing
missing is any trace of that talisman. We found the trap, but failed
to find the mastermind who set it."

"Well done, you two," projected Orange.

"Did you tell Kevin anything?" I asked.

"About the trap in the floor and your journey back into the past?
Haven't gotten around to it yet. I'll let you tell him what you
want. You'll be able to talk to him as soon as I can, if I read you
right. You decided the talisman's nowhere around. It got clear
away."

"Right," projected Blue. "I think it came here for the briefest of
instants, knowing full well that the psychic trap would confuse us."

"No use lamenting the fish that got away," projected Orange.

"We'll catch him before this is done," I projected. "And now for
Kevin."

I was back in my body again and stirred visibly so he'd notice that.
I saw him looking at me with intense interest.

"Well, did you find anything out?" he asked.

"Yes," I replied. "They had originally thought they'd trap you here.
I can understand that as you have to pass by on your way home from
Carleton, and live close enough that they could undoubtedly use an
enticement spell to lure you over anytime they wished. It was a
pretty nasty trap which would only work on psychics. We neutralized
it."

"You make it sound easy," said Kevin.

"Not exactly, though it made a lot of difference knowing what it
was, rather than just blundering into it."

"Green," said Blue, "you look kind of funny standing there with only
one shoe on."

"I smiled and said, "I almost forgot. At least now it's safe enough
to go and get it."

"I'll happily accompany you," said Blue. "It'll be great to stand
there physically with congenial company, now that the place is
clean." We walked in together and Orange and Kevin entered behind
us.

I turned to Kevin and asked, "Are you up to telling us how you came
to be in the park at Dow's Lake?"

"Perhaps more so than you are to telling me precisely how it was you
tracked me down," he said, glancing over at Blue. I could read that
he was getting a glimpse of the real wizard behind the disguise.

"You're right, Green," she said. "He is very perceptive. Let's tell
him what we can. We are indeed three members of an occult order, and
we are very much involved in protecting Earth from these
extra-terrestrial sorcerers. We used our acquaintance with the magic
of John Dee to find you and thwart those who wanted to sacrifice
you."

"I rather expected the masters," he said, "to be all wise old men."

"And not lovely young women," Blue finished for him with a laugh.
"Well, let me assure you, young man, that I'm older than I appear.
Isn't that another thing they say about the masters, that they have
the ability to make themselves appear as healthy and young as they
please? However, we've not said we're the masters, only that we're
adepts."

I could read his thought that whatever we had admitted to, we were
obviously more than mere adepts.

"Now your turn," I said.

"It's very simple," he began. "When I came out of the library I felt
something in the direction of Dow's Lake and decided to check it
out. I'm sorry, Green. I know we agreed that we should keep in
touch, especially about our movements. It just seemed the right
thing to do at the time. I guess I wasn't thinking straight. They
must have set another enticing trap for me there and I walked right
into it."

"Don't be too hard on yourself," I said. "There are very few people
who could resist a summons those sorcerers sent with the potency
they undoubtedly used."

"I wonder where those guys will pop up again," said Kevin.

"I'm not so sure they will," said Orange. "If they're who I think
they are, they're from an order that doesn't look kindly upon
failure. We may see others, but I'd be surprised if we see these
same individuals again."

"With the exception of the talisman," I said. "I have a very strong
feeling that we haven't not seen the last of that."

"Nice guys," said Kevin.

"Oh, very nice," I said. "Anyway, enough about them. What are we
going to do now?"

"Well," said Blue, "you and I could have that interesting chat about
Enochian magic. I've really been looking forward to that."

"Kevin," said Orange, "while we'll try really hard to keep an eye on
you if you want to go home, it may be better for you to come along
with us."
