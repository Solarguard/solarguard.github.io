No. 2 January 11, 2004

The Solar Guard is delighted to present this second 21st Century
Paper.

The principles of effective government over a larger area, as worked
out and demonstrated by the experience of the USA and other states,
include the direct exercise of authority by more than one level of
government on the citizens. While careful consultation will
determine the precise details of the division of powers among local,
state and federal levels of government, the principle of such a
division is a definatory characteristic of federalism.

A popular understanding of the role of the federal level is that
primary among the responsibilities of the over-arching authority are
relations with foreign states, hence, these would include defence
and the army. However, the United States of Earth will not have any
foreign relations, unless and until it comes into contact with
extra-terrestrial polities or establishes sovereign colonies
offworld.

The proposed constitution envisions the federation, not the division
of humanity. As Alexander Hamilton wrote:

   Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new
   Constitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished
   the obvious interest of a certain class of men in every state to
   resist all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power,
   emolument, and consequence of the offices they hold under the
   State establishments; and the perverted ambition of another class
   of men, who will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the
   confusion of their country, or will flatter themselves with
   fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of the empire
   into several partial confederacies than from its union under one
   government.

Intergovernmental affairs, the relations between the federal and
state governments may well involve considerable attention,
especially in the earliest years of the Union. In addition, there
are federal police responsibilities. However, one principal
postulation for the maintenance of vast military forces and a very
extensive military establishment, protection against threats from
irresponsible and rogue states, is eliminated through the
participation of all states in the Union.

There, then, are no threatening and rogue states. Even the USA, at
present the most heavily armed state, will be empowered by Earth's
independence to allay the understandable fears of many other states
and allow the perceived threat of its irresponsible and rogue
actions to become a secure sence of decent civilian connection among
citizens under the Union.

It cannot be concealed that a chief cause for excessive investment
in the unconstructive, the destructive, military sphere of the
economy, apart from such private advantages as suggested by
Alexander Hamilton, is the feeling of insecurity burdening the
spirits of state populations and administrators. The very act of
approving the new constitution replaces such oppression from the now
liberated and balanced consciousness of the healthier direction of
American resources.

Other aspects elsewhere of the consultation on the ratification of
the constitution are significant there. Besides the adviseability of
normalizing human relations, of reducing and eliminating the threat
of rogue US action, there are vast debates on the applicability of
Sharia jurisprudence, on the degree to which the public good takes
precedence over extremes of personal private possessions, on the
precision of the form of democratic governance to be put into effect
through the provisions of the new constitution, etc.

However, this forum is provided more specifically for the range of
discussions of concern primarily for Americans. Apart from conveying
the information and sentiment that one reason for the population and
administrators of other states to more fully support the new
constitution is the consequent diminution and elimination of their
apprehensions of rogue threats from the USA, Americans can also be
relieved that by approving the Constitution, by joining in the Union
of the United States of Earth, other states causing Americans
apprehensions will likewise reinvest their human and other resources
into non-military, into nonbelligerent, into constructive sectors of
the economy.

These and other aspects of the new constitution will be considered
further in future installments of these Twenty First Century
Federalist Papers.
