WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE OGHAMS?, Rev. Robert Lee (Skip) Ellison,
Dragon's Keep Publishing, East Syracuse, NY, 2002

This is a lucid conveying of the essence of THE SCHOLAR'S PRIMER and
more recent material, including the author's innovative contribution
to ogham divination.

There's a succinct presentation of history (from possibly mid Second
Century CE), of usage (alphabetic, gesture, crytographic, divinatory
and magical). There is clear enunciation of the significance of each
of the twenty eight fews in this author's system: twenty original,
five forfeda (additional dipthongs) and the triad: land, sea and sky
which is a very significant innovation by the author, likely to
resonate with many Celtic diviners.

"The Other Oghams" (pp. 40-88) allows those without access to THE
SCHOLAR'S PRIMER to observe this aspect of medieval writing on
ogham. Whether, as Damian McManus states these could appear to
evidence, "idle schoolboys" (McManus, A GUIDE TO OGAM, p. 138) or
whether they conjure concepts of an early 777 or whatever, they seem
limited by their alphabetic nature. Thus, under colour (fifth of
some 120 in mss and of thrice fifty referred to in mss) we find
among others: white, very white, bright, fine coloured, clear,
variegated, piebald, terrible, black, grey, dark grey, brown, dun,
mouse coloured. It may be possible to imagine and attempt to
reconstruct something based on these, though envisaging 777 confined
to an alphabetic principle may suggest something of the magnitude of
the challenge. Some of these extra alphabets are ciphers and some
are suggestions of interesting diagrams (e.g. Wheel Ogam of
Roscadach, no. 101, Fionn's Window, no. 102 and the Stream Strand of
Ferchertne, no. 103). Whatever historical usage was made of these,
they exist as fertile inspiration for present and future minds.

There follow remarks on divination, diagrams (pp. 91-96) of the 28
ogham discs in Skip Ellison's system and his chart (pp. 97-100) on
the fews, including their divinatory meaning. Pages 102-108
introduce the reader to ADF (A/rn nDrai/ocht Fe/in, A Druid
Fellowship), the author's role in that organization, including as
current Archdruid, and some other ADF personalities and
characteristics.

This very valuable little book closes with a bibliography, including
material on the web. It is well worth the read by anyone interested
in the topic.
