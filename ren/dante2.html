There follows a very brief outline of the 33 cantos of Dante's
Purgatorio as translated by Dorothy Sayers. This solarguard site
intends, as this special Renaissance focused year progresses, to
create a special Dante subsection. Therein the outline below will be
enhanced, as will outlines of the other two cantica. In addition, a
glimpse will be presented of the very rich Dante scholarship and at
least one Michael McKenny article on Dante will be provided.

Dante, The Divine Comedy v. 2, Purgatorio, transl. Dorothy Sayers,
Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1984 (1955)

I Cato the Younger asks how they escaped from Hell. Virgil explains and
they proceed.

II The ship of souls arrives and passengers disembark. Dante meets a
friend, the musician Casella.

III Climbing towards Purgatory Dante notices he alone has a shadow.
They meet Manfred.

IV Climbing further they reach a terrace. The sun is high and to the
north, as they're now in the southern hemisphere. They meet lazy
Balacqua.

V They proceed meeting some, including Buonconte, killed before they
could confess their sins.

VI Many ask Dante for prayers. They meet the bard Sordello. There is
criticism of conflict stricken divided Italy and the absent emperor.
Dante satirically praises his native city of Florence.

VII Sordello rejoices on learning it's Virgil in front of him. He tells
Virgil and Dante that the mountain cannot be climbed after dark. They
see a colourful valley whose inhabitants failed to balance spiritual
and worldly duty.

VIII Two angels come to guard the valley at night. A serpent slithers
up, but retreats when the angels swoop towards it. Dante meets Conrad
Malaspina.

IX Dante dreams he's carried aloft by an eagle, wakes to find it's true
and enters Purgatory proper.

X They proceed upwards seeing exquisite sculptures and hearing seven
choirs singing awesome music. They meet some burdened by pride in self.

XI The proud pray the Lord's Prayer, begging forgiveness. Dante meets
several of them, including Omberto Aldobrandesco, Odoriso d'Agobbio and
Provenzano Salvani.

XII They pass images of the proud taken from the Bible and Classical
mythology (e.g. Nimrod, Rehoboam, Briareus, Niobe and Arachne). The
angel of humility meets Dante and erases a p from his forehead. Dante
feels light.

XIII They meet the envious, including Sapia.

XIV More envious, including Guido del Duca and Rinieri da Calboli,
speak to them.

XV An angel erases the second p from Dante's forehead.

XVI Marco Lombardo speaks with Dante about fate and free will.

XVII An angel erases the third p from Dante's forehead. Virgil speaks
of envy, fear of inimical others and vengeance prompting one to sin
against the natural tendency to do good to others.

XVIII Virgil speaks of the soul's tendency to love and of the capacity
of free will. They meet the slothful.

XIX Dante dreams of Virgil unmasking the siren. Awakening he sees a
guiding spirit. They come to the avaricious, including Pope Adrian V.

XX Mention is made of some poor and generous, including St. Nicholas
(Santa Claus). They meet Hugh Capet. The mountain shakes.

XXI They meet Statius who tells them the mountain quaking is a soul
ascending from Purgatory.

XXII, Statius, going with them, says he is purging his spendthrift ways
and opposites are cleansed together in Purgatory.

XXIII They meet gluttons, including Dante's friend Forese Donati.

XXIV Forese asks Dante how the new style of poetry fares. Mention is
made of examples of moderation in eating and drinking. The angel of
Temperance erases the p of gluttony from Dante's forehead.

XXV Statius speaks about physical and spiritual bodies. They come upon
the lustful.

XXVI They see the lustful.

XXVII Dante passes through the purging fire and Virgil crowns him
master over his own self.

XXVIII Dante comes to the wood that is earthly paradise. Here a woman
explains poetic inspiration of a golden age is racial memory of
humanity's sinless childhood.

XXIX They come upon the Pageant of the Sacrament.

XXX Beatrice comes. Dante turns to Virgil who has gone. Beatrice urges
Dante not to sorrow in a place of joy.

XXXI Dante confesses and is taken to drink from Lethe's forgetful
stream.

XXXII Dante comes to the Tree of Knowledge, to the Cross of Christ. He
sees the Whore of Babylon, the corrupt Church, being dragged off by her
lover (the King of France taking the Papacy to Avignon).

XXXIII Dante is told God will avenge the theft of the Papacy. Dante
drinks of the waters of Eunoe, worthy remembrance.
