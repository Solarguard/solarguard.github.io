<center>Home Shrine</center><p>
     
Most of my work is done outside at the Tree Ring. Here is a glimpse
of the pagan aspect of this home:<p>

At the entrance to this house is the place considered especially
sacred to Epona, a special protectress to this household. At the highest
point above the inside of the front door to the porch is an inscription
in ogham in Old Irish which may be translated, "Epona, watch over this
household." She is called upon on leaving home and thanked on returning.<p>

Below this and above the inside of that front door is the first list
of names of ancestors. The names of my great-great grandparents are
written above the inside of the outer door, the names of my great grand-
parents are written above the outside of the inner door, the names of my
grandparents are written above the inside of the inner door and the
names of my parents are written above the outside of the entrance to the
main part of the house from the vestibule. The names of my mother's
Lavergne ancestors that are known back to the mid 1600s are placed below
the inscription to Epona above the inside of the outer door.<p>

On the eastern side above the opening between the living and dining
rooms is a simple inscription in ogham saying, "Oghma". This is
considered the central point in the house, and before this are performed
those rituals here not conducted as a family at the dining room table.<p>

On the west (dining room side) of that central point on which Oghma
is written on the west is a large picture of a tree, stars and candles,
drawn by Sheila, I believe when she was six. The tops of both book
cases, i.e. on either side of this, contain genealogical files and
family albums. Above the right (southern) bookcase is the blue egg made
of wood which comes from an OPN ritual.<p>

On the west wall of the kitchen, above the bookcase near the back door
is a native good luck charm given to me years ago. Above this is my
handwritten copy of a poem I wrote for an OPN ritual:<p>

<blockquote>Manannan, Lyr's son, welcome be.<br>
     Come in peace from the Western Seas.<br>
     You and yours we greet gratefully.<br>
     Come favouring mortals and trees.</blockquote>
