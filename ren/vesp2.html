George and Emily Waters, Harper and Row, New York, 1963, 1926 (1839)

This is the second part of the Solarguard summary of this interesting
Renaissance source. This was written by the leading bookseller of his
generation (1421-1498), one who knew many of the key figures he speaks
about. The book was not published in the original Italian until 1839.

Cosimo de Medici was studious and serious from youth. In his 20s he
spent a couple of years travelling in France and Germany. At home his
quality drew envy. In 1433 he and his brother Lorenzo went as exiles to
Venice. His bank continued to thrive. Venice honoured and supported
him. He returned in 1434 and his opponents were exiled.

Cosimo favoured monks. He spent freely on monasteries. He considered
those with whom he dealt, even beyond the terms of contracts. He was a
patron of the arts. He went out of his way to help the needy. He
resisted those who presumed to cheat him. He spoke carefully. He
avoided backbiting. He had a remarkable memory.

Cosimo could converse with various people about what interested them.
He was knowledgeable on architecture. He had an in depth knowledge of
agriculture, planting and grafting his own fruit trees, pruning his
vines. He had a clear understanding of astrology. The only game he
played was chess. "He knew Magnolino, who was the best chess player of
his age." (p. 225 He pondered deeply his approaching death.

Palla di Noferi degli Strozzi promoted literature and Greek learning.
He encouraged and supported Manuello Grisolaro to come to Italy and
teach many intellectuals Greek. He was sent on embassies abroad. He was
upright and had his children educated by Giovanni da Imola so they
would also be so.

He headed educational reforms in Florence, hiring outstanding teachers
who produced outstanding results. One teacher became Pope Nicolas who
appointed Palla's son Cardinal and papal chamberlain (p. 236, but see
also p. 244)

He was modest, avoided publicity, devoted much time to studies and,
"bought a fine collection of books which he housed in a handsome
building in S. Trinita for the use of the public." (p. 237) He was
among the wise who opposed the Luccan adventure whence stemmed
Florence's tragic civil strife. In 1433 he refused to join Rinaldo,
ensuring his failure. When 62 he was exiled to Padua. There he hired
