Meditation and Two Powers.

This is a replacement for the original file on meditation and the
two powers sent in the late summer of 2000. The original file may
have drawn heavily on a post on this topic to the dedicants list
dwelling on the concept of triadic rather than dual. I notice in
typing up journal entries that the entry for 18/4/99 quotes my
post. My favourable response on first meeting this at the Ostara
ritual is quoted in my description of that ritual in mmrits.txt.

I think I began by mentioning previous experiences with meditation
(the stilling of the mind, ceasing the normally constant flow of
thought, something I've been able to do, if I wish, as long as I can
remember; this stilling of the mind was the form of meditation in
the Edgar Cayce study group I was in back in 1974 and 1975; there
was also the mantric repetition of the Greatest Name "Allah'u'abha"
God the Most Glorious in Baha'i and in the 90s I did some, but not
a tremendous amount, of Qabalistic meditation, basic visualisation
exercises and travelling along the Tree of Life.

Specifically in the ADF context, I recall stating that personally
the Celtic triad resonated more than the duality. I also stated that
while the normal suggestion was that we find a comfortable place and
posture at a quiet time at home to do meditation, personally I now
(i.e. in 2000) more often go to the Tree Ring. In the good weather,
i.e. spring, summer and fall, but not winter, I go sometimes daily
around dawn or in the early morning. The Tree Ring is the sacred
tree, in Irish "Bi/le" of this grove. There most of our rituals are
conducted. Usually, I salute the triad (root, those who have trodden
the path of life ahead of us, that which was; trunk, our goddesses
of rivers, lakes and lands, that which is; the canopy of leaves high
above, the great high Shining Ones, that which is to be). I may do
this both before and after I circle the Tree Ring thrice on the
outside. Then I enter inside the Tree Ring, to the space, maybe four
feet in diametre, enclosed by the trees. These large trees (five
when the original of this was sent, two of these splitting four feet
or so from the ground so from a distance it looked like eight large
trees in a circle with trunks touching or one large trunk, though
with spaces between them starting a few feet above the ground and
there was a narrow entrance, and actually one could rise and
squeeze, especially if small like me, through two or three other
gaps, into a centre about four feet or so in diametre. It was truly
an awesome place to be, encircled by trees and there was where I
normally slid into the meditative state, usually leaning back in the
embrace of one of the trees and seeing myself entering into the ring
of trees, or rising along with them from root, through trunk to
leaves and then back again at the end. It is very relaxing and there
can be a keen sense of being there with the Tree Ring in a mystical
sense. One of the great shocks of my life was the seeing, though
almost a year after this was originally sent, of one of the trees
cut and lying on the ground. This was a tree whose loss made a large
opening of the entrance. I still go there and we still hold rituals
there. There is a lot of the old feeling, but it is not quite the
same. I've also done meditation at home and elsewhere away from the
Tree Ring, visualizing myself at the Tree Ring and always this is
with the original image with all the trees standing.
