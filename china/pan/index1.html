One of the most prominent families through several generations of the Han
Dynasty was the Ban (Pan) family. Michael McKenny has been very interested in this family for years. This subdirectory on this outstanding family contains a Ban (Pan) genealogical chart, a short review of the History of the Former Han Dynasty, written by Ban Gu (Pan Ku), his father and sister, a lengthier review in two files of the material in volume three of the Dubs' edition of that history, a review of Nancy Lee Swann's translation and comments on Pan Chao. This sub directory was created on December 30, 2003 C.E. and last updated on November 4, 2006 C.E. Note that these files were originally created when I was more familiar the with Wade Giles system of transliteration and refer to English material using that system.<p>
