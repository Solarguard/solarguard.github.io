THE AZTECS OF CENTRAL MEXICO, Frances F. Berdan, Holt, Rhinehart and
Winston, New York, 1982.

This fascinating examination of Aztec culture begins with the 
migration of the Mexica to their final settlement. It mentions 
dissent and the execution or abandonment of those not wishing to 
proceed. Thisincludes leaving behind, after receiving the god 
Huitzilopochtli's command in adream, some elders and attendants of 
the goddess Wild Grass Flower, sister of Huitzilopochtli, as well as 
the goddess herself. It mentions the initially subservient role of 
the Aztecs on their arrival into a region already settled and the 
added difficulties their uncivilized manners provoked from those who 
had dealings with them. For example, one friendly patron ruler 
offered birds, incense and flowers at an Aztec ceremony in honour of 
the ruler's daughter, only to discover that the Aztecs had sacrificed 
his daughter and an Aztec priest was wearing her skin.

The Aztecs settled down, founding Tenochtitlan (1325) and their first 
great ruler, Acamapichtli (1372-1391) married into an ancient Toltec 
line attaining thereby legitimacy. Marriage alliances brought 
together theMexica (Aztecs), Acolhuacans and Tepanecs and this 
"Triple Alliance" asthe author calls it, launched the most extensive 
military expansion in Mesoamerica.

Frances Berdan next considers the impressive urban centre of 
Tenochtitlan with its sister community the great market town 
Tlatelolco at least 12 square kilometers in extent. Tenochtitlan had 
four quarters, some eighty
districts, each district with its patron god, temple and 
administrative building. The centre of the city contained temples, 
imperial palaces and administrative buildings.

   These included a "courthouse," where the most important judges     
   presided; a council chamber for the leading warriors; rooms for    
   storing the extensive imperial tributes, along with a dwelling     
   for the caretakers of these stores; housing for other rulers, both 
   allies and enemies; rooms for dancers and singers of the palace;   
   and even a room where those in charge of the activities of young m 
   men received their daily instructions. In addition, Diaz (1956:    
   211-214) observed that Montezuma had two armories filled with      
   lances, bows and arrows, slings, macquauitl (wooden clubs inset    
   with numerous sharp obsidian blades), shields, and quilted cotton  
   armour. He also described an extensive aviary, as well as a zoo,   
   the inhabitants of which gave off an "infernal noise." Diaz also   
   mentioned a library, gardens, and ponds.  p. 12

Chapter 2, "Economic organization" (pp. 15-44), begins with reference 
to the varied geographical conditions of the empire, the fundamental 
importance of agriculture, the staple maize and the great variety of 
ways of preparing it, the number of agricultural deities or aspects 
of deities. Of lesser importance ideologically, but excellent 
complements to maize in the diet, were cultigens such as beans, chia, 
amaranth, chiles, squashes, prickly pear cactus, maguey, and a 
multitude of other fruits and vegetables. Varieties of all these were 
widely cultivated throughout the Aztec empire. p. 18

Cotton was used for prestige clothing and cacoa the prestige drink. 
Fallowing, irrigation, terracing and the use of fertilizer, including 
human excrement, were used in Aztec agriculture. Vegetation and mud 
were also placed into shallow lake areas creating "chinampas." There 
is consideration of the amount of food grown locally at the imperial 
capital and imported from outlying regions of the empire, of special 
crops such as medicinal herbs, of the high status of hunting and the 
capturing of animals for zoos, of domestic animals such as turkeys 
and dogs and how food surpluses allowed many people to devote full 
attention to non-agricultural occupations.

The chapter proceeds to consider the crafts.

   Artisans of luxury goods appear to have enjoyed some degree of     
   exclusiveness in Aztec society; in fact, they were organized in a  
   fashion reminiscent of the craft guilds of medieval Europe.        
   Members of these Aztec craft guilds were set apart from the rest   
   of Aztec society by virtue of their separate residence, control    
   over membership, internal control over education and ranking,      
   distinct ethnic origins, commitments to particular patron deities  
   and religious ceremonies, and special relations with the state. 
   p. 26

There follows reference to the importance and antiquity of 
featherworking, the fine work of the lapidaries and matalworkers and 
the production of some goods, such as books, mats and baskets, by 
commoners.

   Perhaps the most widely distributed craft in central Mexico was    
   weaving. It was a craft undertaken exclusively by women, and all   
   womwn -- regardless of residence, class or ethnic affiliation --   
   learned to spin and weave cloth. Not all women, however, wove the  
   same materials or elaborated garments with the same amount of      
   decoration. Noblewomen, in the households of rulers and chiefs and 
   serving the gods in the temples, appear to have woven the most     
   elaborate and expensive capes, loin cloths, shifts and skirts.     
   They wove this finery using imported cotton and embellished their  
   work with rabbit fur emboidery or feather mosaics. p. 30

Next comes a consideration of merchants. Traders to other lands 
gathered intelligence for the empire. They returned at night to the 
residences of relatives or friends, apparently to conceal the extent 
of their goods. They formed a hereditary guild whose prominent 
members, called "fathers" and "mothers" supervised those hosting the 
lavish merchants' feasts. They regulated markets and punished, even 
executed, malefactors.

The imperial centre exacted a detailed tribute from the conquered 
peoples. Such tribute helped support the Aztec administration, 
military and the palaces.

The chapter mentions the significance of markets and the impressive 
size of the main market at Tlatelolco, the largest in Central Mexico. 
It very much impressed Spaniards who had been to Rome and Istanbul.

   At Tlatelolco, virtually everything produced and crafted in        
   Mesoamerica was on display -- utilitarian goods, luxury items, and 
   seervices. Utilitarian goods ranged from a bewildering variety of  
   maize and chile to pottery, firewood, mats, lumber, and clothing.  
   Numerous vendors sold cooked food, especially tamales of all       
   kinds. Luxury wares included ornate clothing, tropical feathers,   
   precious gems, gold ornaments, and the prized cacao bean. Services 
   were also for hire: barbers, porters, carpenters, artisans, and    
   prostitutes. p. 42

Barter was prevalent. Cacao beans were widely used as money. Another 
item used as currency was the cotton cloak.

Chapter 3, "Social structure and dynamics" (pp. 45-72), begins by 
mentioning that different obligations were placed on members of 
different classes, with more expected of the Upper Class. For 
example, while appearing drunk in public was generally wrong, only a 
noble could be executed for the offence. The author then examines 
individual classes: tlatoque (rulers), tetecutin (chiefs), pipiltin 
(sons of nobles and chiefs), macehualtin (commoners), mayeque (rural 
tenants and serfs), tlacotin (slaves), and social mobility. One could 
move up in the army and the priesthood and down through crimes such 
as theft or lack of means, including gambling losses. War captives 
were normally sacrificed soon after arrival in the capital. There is 
mention of increased competition in the latter days of the empire 
between those of noble birth and those who were achieving prominence 
on their own.

This leads on to a look at the Aztec kinship system which 
acknowledged descent on both male and female lines, at residence 
(nobles would prefer single family residences where younger brothers 
could be head and as commoners were required to render service per 
household, they preferred joint households), and at inheritance, 
generally to son or brother.

   The goal in Aztec succession was not only to find a legitimate     
   heir but also to select a competent successor. This dual goal      
   applied at all political levels. The resulting fluidity in         
   succession rules led to some internal conflicts and a certain      
   amount of "palace intrigue."  p. 71

Chapter 4, "Daily life," (pp. 73-98) begins by considering ideals of 
moderation, industry, sobriety, diligence, obedience, etc.

   ...the usual Mexica daily round consisted of arising at dawn and   
   setting immediately to work. In midmorning it was customary to     
   have a light meal, consisting of a bowl of atolli (maize gruel)    
   for commoners, and the highly prized chocolate for nobles.         
   Following this break, the Mexica returned to work or play,         
   enjoying the main meal at midday. During the heat of the day       
   people would relax, and return to work or diversions for the       
   remainder of the afternoon. It is likely that they enjoyed a brief 
   evening meal, and then retired shortly after sunset. However,      
   during the night, priests arose frequently to offer incense and    
   devotion to the deities, and to sound shell trumpets from temple   
   platforms. Also, during the night, close watch was kept over the   
   cities for any possible military threat. p. 78

There is a description of the popular ball game tlachtli and the 
board game patolli in which beans were marked to serve as dice. There 
is reference to extraordinary events such as service to the state, 
including military service, and religious ceremonies. There is a 
description of the life cycle: the banquet at awareness of pregnancy, 
and the suggestions conveyed to the expectant mother at the time, the 
feast late in pregnancy to obtain a midwife and her advice, birth and 
the welcoming of the child, the astrological determination of the 
child's destiny, the naming ceremony (frequently after the day of 
birth), starting chores at the age of four, training in ritual 
singing and dancing, instruction in writing, memorization of history, 
tradition, dream interpretation and omens, military training, the 
arrangement of the marriage, including determination by diviners of 
the appropriate day, the procession of the bride with the groom's 
female relations to the groom's house where she was supposed to spend 
four days in a room alone with the groom before ceasing to be a 
virgin, establishing a household and undertaking service to the 
state, in old age admonishing the young, sickness, confession, death 
and appropriate afterlife. Among the interesting details:

   When a baby was born, the midwife cut the umbilical cord and       
   buried the afterbirth in a corner of the house. The umbilical cord 
   of a baby girl was buried by the hearth, symbolizing her lifelong  
   attachment to the home. A boy's umbilical cord was dried and later 
   left on a field of battle, thereby dedicating him to service in    
   warfare. p. 83

   The most exalted afterlife went to warriors and to women who had   
   died bearing children. Warriers who died in battle or who had been 
   sacrificed accompanied the sun on its journey from its rising to   
   the zenith. After traveling with the sun for four years, they      
   returned to earth as hummingbirds or butterflies. Women who died   
   in childbirth carried the sun on a feathered litter from the       
   zenith to its setting. At sunset they delivered the sun to those   
   who dwelt in Mictland, the place of the dead. p. 95

The chapter concludes with a look at social control, crime and 
punishment which included stoning, hanging and beheading.

Chapter 5, "Imperial politics and warfare" (pp. 99-118), begins with 
the importance of city-states in the imperial structure. It mentions 
the ruler, hereditary in the case of the Mexica, his duties, his 
election on the death of his predecessor, his council of four, one of 
whom would succeed him, and his affirmation in office by the rulers 
of the other two states in the Triple Alliance, the sacred aspect of 
coronation, preceeded by twice four days of penance and fasting, and 
the coronation feast followed by an aggressive military campaign. It 
mentions advisory councils civil and military, the extensive 
bureaucracy, the importance of capturing enemy warriors on the 
battlefield, fighting to obtain sacrificial victims and wars of 
conquest, the use of merchants to gather information, the continuing 
independence of Michoacan, Tlaxcalla and Meztitlan. The chapter 
closes with a consideration of human sacrifice, human blood believed 
responsible for continuing the universe. It was considered a high 
honour to be one preserving the world's existence and normally those 
reared in this belief system went voluntarily to their deaths. 
Indeed, sometimes they insisted that they be sacrificed. Also, 
connected with sacrifice was ritual cannibalism.

Chapter 6, "Religious organization and beliefs" (pp. 119-142), begins:

   Once every 52 years, the people of central Mexico joined in a      
   solemn religious event. On the designated day, all fires were      
   extinguished, and all household idols thrown out. The cooking      
   implements and the three traditional hearthstones of each          
   household were also discarded. The houses and surrounding areas    
   were meticulously swept and cleaned of all debris. As night fell,  
   everyone climbed to housetops and walls, pregnant women taking     
   care to cover their faces with maguey-leaf masks. Children were    
   similarily masked and not allowed to doze, for if they did, and    
   the critical cosmic rite about to be performed failed, it was      
    believed they would be transformed into mice.

   Then, in the darkness, priests personifying the most important     
   deities ascended the summit of Uixachtlan. At precisely midnight,  
   one of the priests slew a captive in the traditional fashion. With 
   a fire drill, he then proceeded to kindle a new flame in the open  
   chest cavity of the sacrificed captive. If the fire were           
   successfully drawn, all would be well with the universe for        
   another 52 years. The swiftest runners spread this new flame to    
   each temple, school, and household. Meanwhile every man, woman,    
   and child would bleed his or her ears in penance.   p. 119

The chapter continues with reference to the normal anxiety in the 
Aztec belief system epitomized by this cyclical threat of the 
extinction of humanity and the universe. It mentions creation myths, 
the concept of ages 2,028 years long, Quetzalcoatl's role in the 
creation of humanity, the fifths (centre plus four directions), the 
twenty-three other levels in the universe (thirteen above us, nine 
below) with colour, deity and other correspondences.

The chapter moves on to a look at deities, mostly anthropomorphic, 
and the complex pantheon resulting from the assimulative nature of 
the Mexica. Berdan mentions the tripartite view of the Aztec pantheon 
presented in H.B. Nicholson's "Religion in pre-Hispanic Central 
Mexico", HANDBOOK OF MIDDLE AMERICAN INDIANS, vol. 10 pp. 395-446.

   These themes are celestial creativity -- divine paternalism, rain  
   -- moisture -- agricultural fertility, and war -- sacrifice --     
   sanguinary nourishment of the sun and the earth. p. 125

Creator deities included the Lord and Lady of Duality sometimes 
perceived as one divinity with male and female aspects. There were 
also the omnipresent Tezcatlipoca who had one mirror on his head and 
another on his foot and the old fire god Xiuhtecutli. Fertility 
deities included the rain god Tlaloc, his consort (or mother, or 
sister) the water goddess Chalchiuhtlicue, his many helpers, mountain 
top storm gods, the god of spring, Xipetotec, the Maize goddess 
Chicomecoatl and her consort, Centeotl, the Maguey goddess Mayahuel 
and her four hundred rabbits. The war gods included Huitzilopochtli, 
the Aztec patron deity, Mixcoatl-Camaxtli, patron of the Tlaxcallans, 
the fiercest foe of the Aztecs, malevolent Tlahuizcalpantecutli and 
Mictlantecutli, ruler of the underworld.

In addition there were deities not so easily categorized. Most 
notable among these was Quetzalcoatl who performed all three functions.

Next comes consideration of the priesthood: dedication of children to 
temples, the young tlamacazton usually doing menial work, the next 
rank, tlamacazqui, the tlenamacac who sacrificed victims and the two 
high priests, the quetzalcoatl totec tlamacazqui and quetzalcoatl 
tlaloc tlamacazqui, serving the gods Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli at 
their joint temple.

   The priests...spent a considerable amount of time in the service   
   of "their" deities: sweeping the temples; caring for the idol and  
   its accoutrements; manufacturing and caring for the deity's sacred 
   paraphernalia; managing the temples and supervising any necessary  
   additions or repairs; keeping the temple fires lit; and offering   
   the endless penances, prayers, and incence during the day and      
   especially at night. p. 131

Priests read and interpreted sacred books, educated the young, 
advised rulers and engaged personally in warfare. There were also 
priestesses, many of whom served until marriage.

   A "typical ceremonial occasion" began with several days of         
   fasting, at least by the priests, and often by other penitents.    
   The denial of food during fasting was ritually defined. Normally   
   only one meal each day, without chile and salt, was allowed.       
   Sexual abstinence and non-bathing was also expected. At the end of 
   the fasting period, and usually the night before the major public  
   event, a vigil was often held by the most important participants.  
   The extravaganza itself consisted of singing with musical          
   accompaniment, dancing, and colorful processions. Offerings were a 
   part of virtually every ceremony, and ranged from incense and      
   gifts (often food) to animals (usually quail) and human beings for 
   sacrifice. Lavish feasting often marked the final phases of the    
   ceremony... p. 134

There is a three page chart of the wheel of the Aztec year and the 
eighteen rituals of the eighteen "months" of this 365 day year. There 
is reference to a 260 day ritual calendar as well as events that took 
place less frequently than once a year. There follows a consideration 
of divination and magic.

   Quetzalcoatl was the patron of magicians (shamans). Toci was       
   patroness of curers and diviners, and one of Tezcatlipoca's guises 
   was that of a sorcerer. Many of the activities undertaken by the   
   professional diviners and shamans coincided with domains of major  
   deities. For example, while Tlaloc and his many supernatural       
   assistants (Tlaloque) were reponsible for rain and storms of all   
   kinds, certain specialized shamans (teciutlazque, "hail throwers," 
   and quiyuahtlasque, "rain throwers") dedicated themselves to       
   circumventing the devastating hailstorms and magically summoning   
   the rains controlled by these deities. p. 139

There were practitioners of benevolent and malevolent magic. Although 
one could not control one's date of birth, diviners (tonalpouhque) 
did play a role in selecting an auspicious naming day. They also 
chose coronation dates, wedding dates and the best days to plant 
crops and begin journeys. They also were consulted concerning 
illnesses and problems. Some shamans used hallucinogens. The 
coatliquiyolitiani released snakes who would crawl and expose thieves.

   The tlaolchayauhqui ("one who scatters maize kernels") cast grains 
   of maize and beans on a cotton cloak; the distribution of the      
   kernels, read by the diviner, indicated the cause of the patient's 
   illness. The mecatlapouhqui ("cord counter"), by knotting a cord   
   and quickly yanking it, divined the course of a patient's illness; 
   if the knot untied, the patient would recover, but if the knot     
   held fast, the patient was destined to die. p, 140

Chapter 7, "Intellectual and artistic achievements" (pp. 143-158), 
mentions the antiquity of the intellectual heritage of Mesoamerica 
and the support it received from Fifteenth and Sixteenth Century 
rulers, some of whom were keenly interested in scientific and 
literary issues.

   The people at the forefront of these traditions were known as      
   tlaminime, or "wise men." Serving as composers and creators,       
   teachers, and advisers, they embodied knowledge and wisdom: "the   
   philosophers and sages among them were in charge of recording all  
   the sciences they knew and understood, and of teaching from memory 
   all the songs that preserved their sciences and histories" (Alva   
   Ixtlilxochitl 1965, vol 2:18; translation by FRB). p. 143

Frances Berdan proceeds to look at the calendar which divided the 
year (xiuitl) into eighteen months (meztli, moons) of twenty days and 
five additional days (nemontemi), considered unlucky and at the 
Ritual Calendar joining twenty names with the numbers one to thirteen 
and hence 260 days long. She also mentions that the Aztecs calculated 
Venusian (584 days) and Martian (780 days) revolutions. Next there's 
a look at medicine which included knowledge of at least 132 herbs 
with curative properties.

The Aztecs were a literate people, making paper from the inner bark 
of the amaquauitl (such trees as the Ficus benjamina and Ficus 
involuta). They wrote on both sides of this bark paper, the more 
common colours being red, yellow, green and blue.

   Being non-alphabetic, the glyphs provided only guidance or clues   
   to the entire message. Learning to read, therefore, involved much  
   more than merely learning the glyphic symbols: It was essential to 
   have learned, or memorized, the messages themselves. In other      
   words, the reader (and the writer) required a great deal of        
   knowledge not directly expressed in the glyphs. p. 150

   Members of the Aztex elite were prolific creators and reciters of  
   oral literature -- epic and lyric poetry, hymns, plays, orations,  
   chronicles, and histories. Many of the major epic poems, hymns,    
   orations, and histories became standardized and were handed down   
   from generation to generation. The Aztecs were heirs to a long     
   tradition of oral literature. Other forms of this art,             
   particularly lyric poetry, were created in profusion by the Aztec  
   elite, including the renowned rulers of Texcoco, Nezahualcoyotl    
   and his son, Nezahualpilli, as well as rulers and nobles from many 
   other Valley of Mexico cities. p. 155

There were songs dealing with genealogies. There were also prose 
chronicles and speeches recorded. Most of the Aztec written material 
was destroyed by the conquering Spaniards. the chapter also considers 
such fine art as sculpture, metalwork, featherworking and mosaics, 
this last applied to embellishing personal adornment.

Chapter 8, "The consequences of conquest" (pp. 159-186), outlines the 
arrival of the Spaniards in the New World and the conquest of Mexico 
by Cortes and the impact of the invasion on the peoples of central 
Mexico. This includes the devastation by European diseases to which 
native Americans lacked immunity. There was massive population 
decline and resettlement. Among the many changes in political 
control, in economy, in the teaching of Spanish and Latin to the 
Aztec young is of course the attempted substitution of Christianity 
for the traditional Aztec religion.

   Aztec religion was polytheistic and tended to absorb, rather than  
   reject, foreign deities. Although the missionaries insisted on     
   worship of the Christian god alone, a typical Aztec response was   
   to simply absorb this god as one of many in their pantheon. There  
   was also a native tendency to link Aztec deities with Catholic     
   saints. p. 184

This book is a truly fascinating description well worth the read.
