THE AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES, A.P.Elkin, Doubleday, New York, 1969
(1938)

This significant look at the Aborigines by a leading Australian
anthropologist is introduced by Margaret Mead, who mentions the
poetic aspect and the connection to the land of people misunderstood
by Europeans. The author's preface to the third edition (1953)
outlines what had been accomplished in the study of the Aborigines
(primarily the monumental work of Baldwin Spence) prior to the call
at the Pan Pacific Science Congress in 1923 for studying Aborigines
and for establishing an anthropology department, as well as the
systematic study after that period. The original preface (1938)
mentions the hope of learning about Aboriginal ways in order to
inform Whites making and carrying out policies affecting Aborigines.

Chapter One, "The Aborigines and Their Manner of Life" (pp. 1-25),
begins with anthropological divisions of the human species with the
Australoids being a fourth such division. The physical
characteristics of the Australoid are stated and the location from
South India and Malaya to Australia of various groups included. The
arrival to and occupation of Australia are mentioned. There is the
opinion that colonization of the whole continent could have been
rapid and lengthy occupation is unproven, though, perhaps added in
the later edition is the archaeological assessment of more than ten
thousand years of Aboriginal presence in Australia. The problem of
the Tasmanians is discussed without the knowledge the island had
been part of the continent. The total population of Aborigines is
estimated at three hundred thousand in 1788.

The number of tribes is estimated at about five hundred and tribal
population is given as ranging from some one hundred to fifteen
hundred. Linguistic diversity is mentioned. The complexity of
Aboriginal language is discussed. Traditional hunter-gathering and
White disruptions of this way of life are raised. There is
Aboriginal awareness of environment, ancestral influence and ritual
in food gathering and consumption. Nomadic sparsity of material
possessions coincides with cave paintings, body painting and
artistic production of such essentials as spear points. The
boomerang is not universal. There is use of smoke and mosquito huts
against mosquitoes. The physical and intellectual capacity of the
Aborigines, the latter including the ability to adapt to White
culture, are assessed.

Chapter Two, "The Land and the Aborigines" (pp. 26-51), begins with
the tribe:

   A tribe is a group of people related by actual or implied
   genealogy, who occupy and own a definite area of territory and
   hunt and gather food over it according to rules which control the
   behaviour of the smaller groups and families within the tribe.
   p. 26

There are linguistic differences and similarities, mythological
connections to specific territory, inter-tribal connections and
adaptability, though people tend to attribute strange or unpleasant
practices to those outside their tribe and to be quite apprehensive
about travelling through land under the influence of the ancestors
of other tribes. This point is underlined for its application in the
transport of those involved in legal cases outside tribal lands.
There are tribal names often used by people to identify themselves
and others, including sometimes directions, e.g. Bemba north and
Nyul-Nyul south, the last called that, though, even by those south
of them. Tribes may have different customs.

Chapter Three, "The Family and Other Relations" (pp. 52-84), begins
with the known spirit homes in the family territory, the nuclear
family and showing young children adult work. There follow some
thirty pages on kinship and consequent behaviour. Some general
principles: considering the brothers of a direct male ancestor to be
the same as that direct male ancestor, according offspring of males
closer relationship than offspring of the female siblings of those
males.

Chapter Four, "Social Groups" (pp. 85-113), considers age grades:

   In the case of males there are roughly five stages in a person's
   life: childhood, during which there is much association with the
   mother; adolescence and initiation, during which the lad is
   passing through prescribed rituals and living "in seclusion" away
   from the corporate life of the group; early manhood and married
   life when he is learning more and more of tribal mythology and
   the sanctions or authority which it supplies for tribal law;
   "eldership" and a share in the control of social and ritual life;
   and finally old age. The stages are also marked by the
   imposition, especially during the years of initiation and early
   manhood, of taboos on certain valued articles of food, and their
   gradual relaxation during the years that follow. pp. 87-88

There are generational groupings which place together one with the
generation of one's grandchildren, gender groupings, clan groupings
(generally through one line, either patrilineal or matrilineal) and
totemic groupings (not so clearly distinguished as locality spirit
based, rather than from a genealogical line, than is explained in
Spencer's and Gillan's NATIVE TRIBES OF CENTRAL AUSTRALIA).

Chapter Five, "Kinship and Marriage Customs Strange to Us" (pp. 114
to 138), begins by reminding the reader of the validity of different
cultures. It mentions sharing of gifts, avoidance of some specified
relatives (which may include mothers-in-law, uncles, even, after
childhood, siblings), not using true names, arranged marriages,
ritualized elopes or captures of women and provision of women on
some particular occasions, often connected with settling disputes,
making alliances or hospitality.

Chapter Six, "Totemism: Man, Nature and the Past (pp. 139-163),
considers the kinds of totemisn, "individual, sex, moiety, section
and subsection, clan, local and multiple." (p. 147), seems unclear
on the locality spirit concept, refers to differing concepts in
different tribes and distinguishes social and religious totemic
activity.

   To ask a native what is his "flesh", is to receive the name of
   his matrilineal social totem, say, kangaroo or emu. It is his
   flesh, or rather the symbol of the common flesh shared by the
   members of the clan, who, therefore speak of themselves as
   relations. As a result, they will not injure, kill or eat their
   social totem, their flesh, nor will they marry any person who has
   the same social totem, never mind how distant is his genealogical
   relationship or how far away is his country, for he is one flesh.
   p. 148

The cult totem derives from locality spirits, refers to totemic
heroes and the events of their lives, including the paths of their
journeys, along which cult activity continues and one may move safe
through the territory of other tribes, protected by a common totem,
if one's purpose is benign. Such early heroes may be either human
with non-human capacity or wholly non-human. There are rituals at
traditional sites preserving historical awareness and protecting and
increasing the totemic species. Sometimes a father dreams of the
totem of a child to be, though it is the mother who knows when and
where a spirit has entered her. Dreaming, classification and magic
users' totems conclude the chapter.

Chapter Seven, "The Secret Life and Initiation" (pp. 164-196),
begins with the exclusion of the uninitiated, even White authority
figures long residing among natives, from much Aboriginal thought.
Indeed, even a succeeding generation assessed too remote from
tradition and too attracted to White ways may be deprived of
ancestral knowledge by elders sheltering the sacred trust. Physical
accompaniment, such as knocking out a tooth or circumcission, of
initiation and the possible correlation of such to burial practices
is mentioned. Significantly:

   From the point of view of the tribe, the novice is being made,
   through a system of discipline and teaching, a worthy member of
   society and a future custodian of its sacred mythology and
   ritual. Moreover, the social sentiments on which the unity of
   society depends are being inculcated in his mind, and at the same
   time are being strengthened in the minds of all present at the
   ceremonies. p. 176

There is the preliminary airing of disputes and settling of grudges,
even the hurling of weapons, that, apologies made, the community can
commence the serious business of ritual ceremony. Initiation rituals
include taking the boy from the women, welcoming him with ceremonial
combat and feasting, tossing him in the air, performing a physical
operation, secluding him, exposing him to fire, conveying secret
knowledge to him, washing him to return him from ritual to normal
existence. Bull-roarers (churingas), sacred objects, are mentioned
and the sanctity of their secret storage place which provides
sanctuary to any animal or human reaching it. Women are not included
completely in secret male rituals, though to varying extents in
various tribes they have roles and know some of what is going on.
Women also have their own secret rituals.

The chapter concludes with admonition to White decision makers not
to destroy Aboriginal secret life.

Chapter Eight, "Aboriginal Philosophy, Rites and Beliefs" (pp. 197
to 232), begins with most Westerners normally unconscious of their
philosophy and beliefs. Aborigines are the same. Examined,
Aboriginal thought is animist with spirit homes, whence humans are
conceived and where power to, for example, increase species resides.
Totemism with its division and classification of all things follows,
then tradition:

   To the Aborigines, things are as they are, because of the
   personal actions of heroic beings in the past; customs are
   followed because they were the customs of, or were ordained by,
   these heroes; and life is possible for man and nature now because
   of their actions and life-giving powers. All that is, that must
   be and will be, is a matter of historical continuity with the
   heroic past. p. 209

This continuity is felt in the concept of the real and time
embracing dreamtime. There is awareness at a distance, ability to
contemplate, capacity to heal by faith, mythical reenactment and
purposes of myth (supporting custom, explaining the origins of
geographical features, giving the etymology of names, etc.). Sky
heroes, a mother goddess, a rainbow serpent are mentioned.

Chapter Nine, "Art and Ritual" (pp. 233-255), mentions the variety,
skill and tradition of Aboriginal art forms.

   The Aborigines' forms of art are varied. Of these, engraving in
   stone and shaping or painting figures of earth are the only ones
   no longer practised. The others are engraving in wood and shell;
   carving and painting wooden figures in the round; making and
   decorating composite ceremonial objects; painting on stone
   surfaces (the walls and roofs of caves and rock shelters), on
   bark "canvases", and on the human body; ritual re-enactment of
   mythology; ballet and imitative dancing to the accompaniment of
   rhythmic tapping or beating (of sticks, boomerangs, "gongs" of
   solid or of hollow wood, or of cupped hands on thighs), and
   usually also of singing or chanting; and the use of poetic
   imagery and rhythm in song-making. p. 234

The author's division of Australia into eight artistic regions
comes next: Southeast, Northeast Queensland, Lake Eyre, Southern
and Western, Central and North Central, Southwest, Kimberley, and
Arnhem Land. There's the use of sacred designs on such material
things as weapons and tools, empowering with spirit the artefact.
The diversity of environment across the continent, with some
regions more able to support particular art forms (tree engraving,
petroglyphs, cave paintings) is mentioned.

Chapter Ten, "Music and Dancing" (pp. 256-281), begins with the
previous lack of studied attention and the technical difficulties of
recording impressive natural night time corrobories. Instruments,
especially the four or five foot long trumpet like didjeridu, are
mentioned. There are secular songs, including some concerning
contact with Whites and European articles (airplanes, playing cards,
etc.). There is musical pattern and the heriditary Songman. There is
the very rich dancing and diffusion of songs and dances.

Chapter Eleven, "Medicine Men and Magic" (pp. 282-310), begins with
the rarity of the evil sorcerer, also accorded this designation by
Whites. Illness is attributed to malefic human or animist agency.
Medicine men diagose and cure disease. They cure by magically
sucking out foreign substances from the area of pain, or by sending
his familiar into the patient, or by finding the sick person's
wandering spirit and bringing it back to the body where it belongs.
Medicine men are consciously aware of spirits, including the spirits
of those killing by magical means. One with the talent studies with
a master, and, when ready, is accepted by the spirits in a ritual.
Generally, medicine men follow high students of conduct.

Chapter Twelve, "Death and What Follows" (pp. 311-338), begins with
the social impact of a death, with mourning, with the belief a death
has magical causes and the retribution therefore undertaken.

   Where interment is practised, the grave is dug and usually the
   body is protected from the surrounding earth by bark or leaves;
   very often the deceased's personal belongings and weapons are
   also put in the grave, though sometimes these are burnt with his
   hut. The grave may, or may not, be filled in at once according to
   local custom. Also, in some regions, instead of interment, the
   body may be placed in a tree-stage or, after due preparation,
   carried round with the group for a period, or cremated. p. 317

There are two souls, one departing to the spirit home, another more
present. From the latter the living seek disassociation by
destroying everything connected with the deceased and by taking
retribution against whoever was magically responsible for the death.
Pages are devoted to the determination of that guilty party and more
pages to various burial rites. Then comes concepts of life after
death, reincarnation and the cycle of existence.

Chapter Thirteen, the Epilogue (pp. 339-357), outlines stages of the
contact between Whites and Aborigines (White arrival, settlement,
opposition to natural Aboriginal taking of cattle, White law,
vigilantes, missionaries, goods, jobs, alcohol, World War Two and
interaction of Aboriginals and Whites in military camps, Aboriginal
settlements as centres of preparation for life in the White World)
and considers contemporary complexity according to the apparent
assumption of the inevitability and desireability of assimilation.

The text closes with a five page bibliographical note.
