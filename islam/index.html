<H1>Islamic Civilization</H1>

One of the most impressive and extensive (in time and in space) civilizations humans have produced (some would say inspired by God) is the awesome civilization of Islam. This section currently offers a brief introduction and precis of volumes 1-34 of the English translation of at Tabari, a review of Lunde and Stone's translation of the Abbasid portions of al-Mas'udi, a summary of volume one of the English translation of Ibn Khaldun, a review of Dr. Khalifa Abdul Hakim's ISLAMIC IDEOLOGY and brief summaries of Albert Hourani's A HISTORY OF THE ARAB PEOPLES, of The Islamic Propagation Organization's ISLAMIC REVOLUTION OF IRAN and David Fromkin's A Peace to End All Peace. This was last updated on March 27, 2007 C.E. with the addition of the review of Lunde and Stone's translation of al-Mas'udi's Abbasid portions. In the weeks and months ahead additional reviews and summaries of significant Islamic material will hopefully help many from various human backgrounds better appreciate this often poorly understood integral component of humanity.<p>
