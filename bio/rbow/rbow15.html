RAINBOW Michael McKenny

Chapter Fifteen Continuity

"And, Kevin, what are you doing while all this is going on?" asked
John.

I was still sitting there gaming, worrying about Green, who had left
so abruptly ten or fifteen minutes earlier. I was torn between a
desire to check to see how he was doing outside and the fear that
he'd react unkindly to any meddling. So, I continued playing with my
mind only half on the game.

"Well," I answered, "I take the vial in my right hand and toss it
very carefully into the middle of the orcs."

"Check your dice."

"Plus two," I said, as I shook the dice and prepared to make my
throw. However, I never consciously completed that roll.

A myriad of sensations exploded in my mind, and it seemed that
everything had speeded up. There sat the other gamers with their
expressions frozen on their faces. Not one of their muscles
twitched.

There came into my mind a pattern of light, brilliant and dazzling.
Seven rays of light were leaping from one nova bright blaze of
white. There was the violet of Life's Herald, the star which arrives
just before dawn on the day the rainy season begins. There was the
indigo of nadoranth, a planet's most precious stone. There was the
blue of the waves of the Sea of Yattashdor. There was the red of the
treesprite and the heart. There was the luminous orange of the life
giving sun. There was the yellow of heaven's breath, the fairest
flower in the world. And, there was the green of the forest. Seven
rays of light shining in the night. Seven rays of light colouring
seven cloaks and seven rings of power.

There was the face of an old man with a cloak the colour of the
leaves, a staff, a laugh, and a long beard. There was a forest such
as I'd never dreamed with trees towering higher than the CN Tower.
There was an old stone tower by a pool. There was a table as round
as King Arthur's, only this one was divided into several equal parts
and each part was a different colour. Around that rainbow hued table
were placed seven simple chairs, each chair the same colour as that
portion of the table in front of it.

Then there was a kind of picnic in the woods and I was asking in a
little boy's voice, "Why are the leaves green?" A kind old man in a
green cloak looked down at me and smiled. "They are green because
they are alive and young as are you," he said. Then I saw the same
old man, only now we seemed to be the same height. I was listening
very intently as we strolled through woods more impressive than the
jungles of the Amazon. "The green grass upon which we walk does not
complain about the burden of our weight. How can we complain about
any burden which life may place upon us?"

Then I was aware of a grim faced man in an emerald green cloak
holding a staff from which blazed a dazzling verdant ray, towards
huge black ten legged things dangling from a web. Then there was a
man pouring over the pages of a book, upon which was written a
script I had never seen before, and yet which it seemed I could
understand. I beheld an earnest young man, his eyes filled with
tears, as he touched a curious emerald hued ring on the middle
finger of his right hand.

Then, there was the same man centuries later gazing at the silvery
clouds in the skies of a distant world. There came a kaleidoscope of
impressions of that alien planet. There was a person, and, suddenly,
with a jolt, I realized that person was myself, and nine black
cloaked figures were swirling in the dark, around a circle of trees.
Something like a dragon was soaring in the sky above this ordinary
Canadian city. A black cloaked skeleton was readying a fearsome
glyph, and I was facing death with all the calmness and serenity of
the forest at home and the ever placid pool by the Tower of the
Wizards. I could feel the thoughts of all my predecessors throughout
the ages and I knew that they approved, as I presented the long dead
skeleton a book and the truth and it fell to dust.

There was but one final thing to do, one last responsibility to the
many generations of the past and for many more to come. As I fell, I
willed my ring to move. A portion of my spirit, something similar to
what the ancient Egyptians called a ba, bore the ring to the finger
of the one I named, to the one I charged to accomplish all that
remained to be done.

It felt as if electricity was running wild within my brain, carrying
the tidings I'd never imagined could possibly be borne. It seemed
that Green was not just one of the mightiest adepts on Earth. He was
some sort of extraterrestrial magician or rather wizard. It seemed
that he and his two colleagues had been doing more than saving my so
worthless hide. They had been confronting, on behalf of Earth, an
ultradimensional demon and a living skeleton whose grimoire had the
ability to summon here a being at least as evil as Satan. It seemed
my friend had just died, as he lived, in Light and on behalf of
Light.

More than that, much more than that. It seemed that he had entrusted
his magical ring to me, and that by means of this awesomely potent
device, I was somehow drawn into the matrix of this alien wizard. It
seemed that the great god who had set the system in motion had
intended that the number of the colours on this psychic rainbow
never diminish, and his way of ensuring that was the matrix formed
by a wizards' ring of power. It seemed that I not only learned that
my friend had ascended from the realm of the living, but I found out
at the same time that I was his successor.

"Awesome," came a voice from my right.

"Perfect roll," came another voice.

"Way to go," came a third.

Only then did I realize that the dice must have fallen from my
fingers. A shudder was passing through my body, and I reflexedly
stilled it. My brain seemed to be on fire, and all I did was clench
my teeth. I could feel the ring which my physical eyes could not
perceive. I could sense it calming my spirit, relaxing the muscles
in my jaw. The image came into my mind of a blazing fire moving into
a fireplace. In place of raging uncontrollable strength came the
realization that I was warm and comfortable.

A smile came onto my face.

"Now to roll for damage."

I nodded, picked up the dice, shook them and threw them onto the
table.

Awareness surged within me. I felt conscious of every cell in my
body. As fast as thought, hundreds of specific suggestions flowed
out from the ring and my conscious mind acted upon them, exercising
control, even at the subatomic level. Impurities in the blood and
the tissues of my body were transmuted into exactly the atoms and
compounds required at each precise anatomical location. I felt
enormous activity in my physical brain. This moved up from the
purely biological to mental and psychic levels.

I analyzed the situation and decided on my response at once.

"You got two of them. Four others are injured."

"You know," I said, "I better go check on Green. He's been out there
long enough. Don't delay the game for me. My guy can be a NPC, or
Jim can play him until I get back, on the condition he doesn't do
anything stupid."

"Sure thing."

There were some shrugs.

I stood up and slowly made my way to the door. I opened it, and
stepped out. After a moment I went back in. They looked up, so
involved in the game they were barely aware of me.

"Uh, I think I better see Green gets home," I said.

"Really?" asked the gamesmaster. "That's too bad. Well, see you next
week."

I said goodbye to him and the others.

Then, I was standing outside, beneath the stars, while a breeze
caressed me. My heightened awareness flooded my computer like brain
with megabytes of information about the chemical composition of the
air, the nature of the vegetation in the vicinity, even the
micro-organisms inhabiting that vegetation.

"I think you should check in with Orange and Blue," suggested the
ring, or sprang the thought from my own mind. We were so linked, I
was not sure I could distinguish myself from it. I felt the energy
building within me at just the inner location that would permit me
to transmit thought across the city.

"Orange, Blue," I projected, sending out my mental call.

"Ah!" came Orange's instant reply. "So, he chose you. Well, well."

I realized that it had never happened before that an offworlder had
been named to the Council of Colours.

"I'm sorry," I projected.

"Don't be," projected Blue. "He died a hero." Yet there came also
the visual of an empty boat on the sea at night. I wondered if this
had any connection with Anubis, the boatman of Egyptian mythology
who bore the souls of the dead from the land of the living to the
further shores. My ring was silent, and I felt it would be impolite
to ask Blue or Orange just now.

There came the clear image of the apartment where the two were
standing. I could feel the rainbow of emotions surging within them.
It had happened before in the centuries and more during which they
had been alive, that the eternal soul of a wizard had gone beyond
this finite existence. It was recorded in the memory of our rings
that long ago wizards had perished striving valiantly on behalf of
Light. That did not really remove from these two mortals the reality
of their sense of loss, nor alter the fact that I, the new Wizard of
Green, was not identical with the old one.

I went to them. I entered that strangely normal looking apartment.
Blue and Orange had removed all traces of Zandala's violent entry.
They had already removed the dust which had been all that remained
of the sorcerer and his book. This had been teleported to
Gvihlih-hih, the world of the wizards, a planet which seemed both
strangely alien and at the same time my home world.

As this thought shot through my awareness, I shook my head, as if to
clear it. It felt terrifyingly weird to be experiencing this
awareness of all of my predecessors, this strangeness of being the
Wizard of Green, and at the same time to hold all the memories of
the person I had been but a quarter of an hour before. I knew, or
had access to through the ring, their, our, language and the other
tongues of our planet, as well as numerous and varied spells and all
the many facts and faces and everything else stretching back through
the long history of the existence of the Wizard of Green. Yet, was
not I born on Earth?

"Don't worry about it," projected the Wizard of Blue whose features
were perfectly composed, though I could clearly perceive the tears
within her heart and the clouds raining upon her thoughts. "You will
get used to it, and you will not lose your individuality, your sense
of being you amidst so vast a memory."

"It has happened to us all," projected Orange. "You may be the first
to come from Earth, and that is the distinction that most occurs to
you now. Yet, each of us had our symbols of separateness, our items
of individual identity, that seemed, to us, on the verge of being
swamped and submerged in the ocean of all these lifetimes in the
ring of our colour. We were not drowned, nor will you be."

"Thank you," I projected, "for your attentive consideration in this
moment of your grief."

Deep as was our grief, there seemed to be one consolation. The great
struggle that had raged on Earth appeared to be over. The dead
sorcerer and his abomination of a grimoire had been given their
final rest. Now this world could be at peace. The most effective
means of allowing the ruler of the other dimensional realm to quit
his abode and venture into this space time continuum was gone.

However, I could read, not only within the minds of the two other
wizards present, but also within the minds lingering within my own
ring, the analysis that my hope was unfounded in reality.

I went with the other two as we removed the final trace of the
mighty magical confrontation that had raged here. We bore the
physical remains of the former wearer of the verdant ring out of
this room, building, city and planet. With the waving of our hands,
with the vocalization of certain syllables of none of the multitude
of Terran tongues, with the visualization in our three minds of a
spot light years away, we found ourselves very soon, almost
instantaneously, beneath the very tall trees of the greatest forest
of that other planet.

I saw the rising simple stone tower of the Council of the Wizards. I
saw the placid waters of the Pool of Life. "What a wondrous pool," I
thought. "I wonder what it's origin is?"

"A very ancient legend has it that once a maiden whose betrothed had
been slain in war came into this forest to die of grief. And when
she wept beneath the trees here, her tears so moved the god of this
forest and planet, that he, too, wept and this pool was the result
of those divine tears. Also, he brought the man back to life and
from the seed of that couple sprang the race from which came the
very first members of the Council of Colours, whose first duty was
to end war and establish the Great Peace."

"Green?" I thought.

"No, I am but the residue of his memory, and the memory of the
others. His true essence has gone to that higher reality, of which
this is but the reflection."

"Are there other duties?" I asked.

"Yes, and you will learn them all. Our second duty is to ever
protect this planet and now, it seems, other ones, from the serious
misuse of magic." I realized that this was not the first time one of
us had died while discharging that responsibility. It was the first
time, though, that one of us had given his life to protect the
people of an alien world, that alien world known to its inhabitants
as Earth.

I saw the other four wizards: Red, male, and Yellow, Indigo and
Violet, three females, silently emerge from the tower. There were
minor physical differences such as two nonTerran skin colours.
Yellow was orange hued, the others green. Each one had an extra
finger and rounder ears. Such details were insignificant. They were
walking with a gait that was more than regal and completely natural.
They joined us at the shore of the sacred pool.

Each of the other wizards present bowed first to the form of their
former colleague and then to me, his chosen successor. I bowed,
too.

When I lifted my head, I found that I was looking right into the
eyes of Violet. I shivered and noticed that she had caught her
breath. She was obviously another great female adept, like Blue.
Yet, as we held each other's gaze, even though it was but an
instant, it seemed as if water flowed between us. I could not read
her thoughts. They were too well guarded. I blushed, for I was sure
they could all read mine and this was hardly the place. Then we
stood there in silence, a silence more expressive of grief and
sorrow than all the speeches and eulogies ever written and spoken.

My increased awareness presented an amazing image. I saw, as in a
waking dream, a vast forest and all the trees were still. No leaf
stirred and most surprising of all, no new leaves were being added
to it. Then I gasped as it dawned on me what I had stumbled on. I
was sensing mentally the vast silence which spread out from this
spiritual heart of the great forest, through all the dales, into
every hut and beyond, across the vast plains, fertile valleys and
the mountains, isles and towns of this entire planet.

Then this waking image of the forest grew at the speed of thought.
That vast forest I imagined in my mind's eye produced hundreds of
new trees, all of them solidly green, and each of the other trees
added numerous green leaves. Each leaf seemed to be a thought. I was
mentally staggered at the impression that somehow this was the
mental construct of all the telepathic activity of a planet of
telepaths.

"That is exactly what it is," came a thought from my ring. "We think
of this as the high forest. It is our telepathic, our computer free,
Internet, to use your terms. At this moment all of the people, or as
many who can send leaves, thoughts, to our high forest, are sending
them, posting a message, to honour the departed Wizard of Green.
Everyone here is remembering him, recalling personal contact in this
the high forest, or elsewhere, with the luminosity that was his mind
and spirit. They are thanking him for all he's done to brighten
their lives. And, all of them are wishing Green the very best in the
future."

I could clearly see the green leaves, so very many of them in that
immense forest, at the tops of trees growing and rising swiftly
higher. Each leaf had its distinct individuality and all of them
swayed beneath a warm and fragrant breeze in my direction. All the
people on this planet were wishing me well. That was a most humbling
thought. I had been but an ordinary guy, someone no one would think
of looking at twice, just another face in the crowd.

I realized that I should say something, anything and felt so
flustered. Telepathy was so new to me. How do I go about expressing
my overwhelming unworthiness, gratitude and hope to somehow not fail
too miserably to fulfill their expectations?

Then right before my eyes appeared a leaf with Violet's eyes on it
and letters in the language of the forest. They spelled, "Everything
will be fine. Do not worry."

Another leaf, bearing the serene features of Indigo, appeared beside
it. The veins on this leaf seemed to be the strings of an instrument
vaguely suggestive of a harp which thrummed the words, "Worry not. I
have taken care of it. Thy leaf hath been seeded, that is, your
message has been posted."

I saw a small and unimposing leaf appear at the top of each of the
many trees and realized that somehow Indigo had posted my thought
message throughout the telepathic Internet.

"Indigo is our Chief Ranger in the high forest, what you may
consider our sysop," explained my ring.

And as the trees all continued their upward expansion with messages
about the charming humility of Earthmen, my mind was reeling with
the implications of the concept of one mind, Indigo's, directing
more than one e-mail list or newsgroup. She was taking care of the
whole planetary telepathic Internet.

The words on the Violet leaf changed. Now they read, "Thou shalt
behold the dew ere dawn, that is, you'll understand all this better
as time passes and certainly after your first night in your tower.
Be relaxed. All will be well. Now that we have all wished you well,
we will again be silent, and for as long as the sun is in the sky
here, the high forest will be as still as possible. Then we seven
will bear his remains to the Mountain of Zeemoneem."

We wizards stood in silence as the orange sun moved across the sky.
The ever present and eerie mind's eye image of telepathic activity
across the whole planet showed a little activity. However, I
realized that even though most people were now resuming some
semblance of normal life, the overwhelming majority of them were
refraining from sending any unimportant messages. Only when the sun
dropped beneath the trees, only when the soulbearer, a bird that
cries out near sunset, had uttered his call, did we wizards move
from the pool. Yet, the funeral was not over. We were moving still
in formal and solemn ritual. We rose from the shore of the Pool of
Tears and our minds in stately solemnity respectfully visualized the
spell which lifted his physical form aloft into the sky before us.
As the shadows of night fell upon the ground, we flew behind his
physical form, carefully sent forth by our minds on one final
flight.

Night lay upon the land. We passed over the great forest, the
material reality which had provided the inspiration to these people
for their symbolic concept of the high forest. We continued across
the vast southern steppe. When at last we drew near the frontier of
that steppe, we saw a large river and its valley and beyond,
towering in the distance, the mountain range within which he and his
predecessors had dwelt for so many ages. Now, those mountains were
below us. There seemed to be so many of them. They seemed to stretch
so far. I thought, these mountains may not be quite as tall as the
Rockies or the Himalayas, but, they seem to cover a greater area.
However, perhaps that was just an erroneous impression.

And all the while we flew we uttered not a word, and even our
thoughts we kept to ourselves. The high forest was very still. Even
the various minds in the ring kept their thoughts away from my
conscious awareness. This was a time for each to be with his own
grief. It was the most awe inspiring time of my life. Much of that
time I thought about my friend and his sacrifice on behalf of Earth.
Some of that time I passed reflecting on the sanctity of life and
the eternity of the soul, which frankly I'd never worried too much
about before. And, I'll admit I could not completely avoid thinking
of Violet who seemed even more attractive than Blue.

At last, just as a strangely orangish glow was touching the eastern
horizon, we came to the peak of a mountain different from the rest.
For some time we had been passing above a region that seemed
desolate and devoid of human life. Now, before us was a mountain
whose peak was crowned by a domed tower. This was the place, where
from time immemorial, the Wizard of Green dwelt. Here is where he
spent his time and lived his life observing the stars, studying the
ancient records of the southern peoples, writing his works on
ancient mages and penning some of the most penetrating analyses of
the principles of magic ever written.

Very carefully and with the deepest respect, we brought his finite
husk to the front of the tower. And, the mountains themselves, the
stones and earth, the ground all around began to resound as with the
pounding of a drum. Slowly, so very slowly, tolled this astonishing
memorial from all the atoms of the landscape that had been his home
throughout so much of his life.

In a voice strident and awesome, Indigo pronounced, "As it was in
the dawn of time, as shall it be in the sunset of the ages, freely
the atoms move, combining in patterns and flowing apart, joining for
an instant and going separately each its way. May each atom that was
for a moment connected with the Green ray of the rainbow forever and
for eternity bestow unending beneficience upon everything and upon
everyone it touches. A verdant, an emerald, a green blessing to
all."

A wind gently swept through the mountains. The physical form of the
former Wizard of Green misted over, rising into that wind, expanding
as a nebulous carpet of green.

When I next returned here, I would be the wizard living in this
tower, carrying on the studies and the work of all who had gone
before.

Although we had travelled thousands of kilometres in omly one night,
it had still been a slow stately journey. Going back was no longer a
trip than had been the far voyaging across interstellar space. One
moment we were hovering over the Tower of Green in the southern
mountains. The next we were back at the sacred Pool of Tears and the
Tower of the Wizards.
