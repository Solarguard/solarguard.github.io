<p>THE VALLEY OF THE LATIN BEAR, Alexander Lenard, Dutton, NY, 1965.
    
<p>Here is a sample of the humour of this author.

<p>"Brazil has more laws than any other country," a dear native friend
explained to me in Sao Paulo. "The only law we lack is the one which
prescribes that laws have to be obeyed." Another, himself a teacher in
law school, added, "Brazil received the Roman law from Portugal,
Napoleon gave her the code civil, the United States furnished her with a
constitution, and Mr. Schacht inspired her currency regulations. The
Brazilian legislators had nothing else to do but to invent the loopholes
for the whole net." 

<p>Lenard is the doctor of the small town of Donna Irma in Santa Catarina
in the south of Brazil. He describes a typical rural European
environment, replete with its independent personalities and
superstitions. There is one humorous story about this guy showing up in
the doctor's office and asking about this sore. He has, of course, been
trying home remedies and only went to the doctor as a last resort. The
doctor tries to convince him to take modern medicine (To be fair to the
guy with the sore, he inquired the cost of the medicine, which was five
weeks wages for him) in vain. In his tirade against superstition, the
doctor let slip what was done in his country (nine drops of water taken
from a well under the full moon are applied to the sore on a Friday, or
was it three Fridays?). Anyway, next thing here's this guy come to pay
him a quarter of a calf, as he had tried the doctor's derided
superstitious method and it had worked.

<p>There's a funny story about these guys getting on a train and complaining that 
there is no difference in the seating of the first and third class passengers, 
although there is a great difference in price.  "Just wait," the rail officials 
say. So along they go until the train runs out of wood to burn and they stop in 
the middle of the bush.  "Okay," shout the train officials: "third class 
passengers, here are axes. Chop down trees. Second class passengers, chop the 
felled trees into small logs for us. First class passengers, remain seated. We 
will be proceeding shortly."

<p>Then there is the delightful rejection notice he received when he sent
off his Latin translation of Winnie the Pooh. "Maybe you have too much
spare time, but we don't."

<p>Michael McKenny, "Ordem e Progresso", March 3, 1990<p>
