Renaissance Princes, Popes and Prelates, Vespasiano, transl. William
George and Emily Waters, Harper and Row, New York, 1963 (1926), 1839

This edition has a special introduction by Myron P. Gilmore (pp. xi-
xvi) noting Burkhardt's statement that this book inspired him to write
The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy. Vespasiano (1421-1498)
was the most famous bookseller of his time. He supplied bibliophiles
such as Cosimo de Medici, Niccolo Niccoli, Naples' King Alfonso and
Pope Nicolas V.

He sold his shop in 1480 and spent his final years writing, this book
being his greatest work, although it was not published until 1839. His
account here of these Renaissance figures contributed to the concept of
the Renaissance man.

Pages 1-12 are the translators' introduction. They enumerate English
patrons of Vespasiano's bookshop, state the interest to historians of
Vespasiano's lives, condemn his style, grammar and spelling, admit his
proficiency in storytelling and express regret at his leaving out
contemporary artists.

Pages 13-15 are the author's introduction, asserting he writes to
preserve the memory of worthy men, providing vernacular notes for
serious Latin historians.

17-31 Pope Eugenius IV was a Venetian who turned in youth from a rich
inheritance to become a Blue Friar. Antonio Coreri's (a fellow Venetian
friar's) uncle, Pope Gregory, made both of them cardinals. Elected in
1431, Pope Eugenius was forced to leave Rome due to popular unrest. He
came to Florence, revived monasticism, summoned a council to reconcile
Greeks and Ethiopians with the Latin Church, lived simply, was generous
and of awesome presence.

31-58 Pope Nicolas V was born at Pisa. When he was young his mother had
a vision he would become pope. He was very studious, fluent in Latin
and well read. He tutored sons of prominent people. He was included in
papal embassies across the Alps. On his return from one mission to
Germany, Pope Eugenius made him a cardinal. He delivered Eugenius'
funeral oration and was elected his successor.

He ended the schism, appointed Felix cardinal in Savoy. He established
the Italian League bringing peace to Italy for 25 years. He celebrated
the jubilee. He vigorously supported the gathering and translation of
texts, assembling a library unrivalled since Ptolemy's time. He
conducted building projects in Rome. He crowned Frederick Holy Roman
Emperor in a magnificent ceremony.

He was generous and abstemious. He fell ill during an outbreak of
plague, but recovered. A plot to assassinate him was discovered, the
leader executed, the rest pardoned. Pope Nicolas took his leave of life
in a highly spiritual manner, speaking clearly of the duty of his
hearers to support the Church.

58-83 Alfonso King of Naples was a very devout man. He kept vigils,
knew the Bible well, washed the feet of the poor and personally served
the poor dinner. He was generous and honourable, refusing an offer to

considerate of great and small. He was honest, insightful and abhorred
deceit. He kept the oath he made as a teenager to refrain from
gambling.

He gathered learned men around him, including Bartolomeo Fazi of Genoa
who wrote his biography. He was conscientious, studied hard, especially
enjoying Livy. When he fell seriously ill, he sought absolution for his
sins and died worthily.

He had military training under Nicolo Piccinino and was widely read in
history, sacred literature and philosophy. He was a skilled architect,

in music, sculpture and painting, hiring the best in these fields to
enhance his residence. He assembled the most complete library of his
time.

He was a very capable administrator, always keeping his word, observing
fasts and vigils, generously supporting the learned and religious, ever
approachable and quick to pardon any offence save blasphemy. He was
humane, speaking only good of others and listening to naught else. He
was keen to reconcile those of his people angry at each other.

He fell ill defending Ferrara and when advised to seek healthier air,
placed the greater good above his own life.

leader who assembled a great library. He helped monks.
