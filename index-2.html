<h1>Michael McKenny's Web Page</h1>

<!-- vodaQHmem -->

Welcome to Solarguard, a consideration of Human Archaeology, Anthropology, History, Literature and Spirituality. This site was last updated on October 27, 2014 with the addition of a Canadian section.<p> 

I extend enormous thanks to Michel Boucher for his essays on Celtic Mythology and Irish literature and for his substantial work which may be seen in the Solarguard Canadian Archaeology section. Furthermore, he created this solarguard page and showed Michael McKenny how it works. All its imperfections are mine.<p>

Also available here are Michael McKenny's novel Rainbow, his reviews, some quite substantial, of more than a hundred and fifty books and of one awesome movie, his consideration of the games Enochian Chess and Fidchell (or hnefetafl), his thoughts on the futhark (runes) and Irish ogham, his comprehensive listing of the planets named in some three dozen Andre Norton books, some of his poetry, seven of his Twenty First Century Federalist papers and valuable links.<p>

Michel Boucher's own very interesting and fascinating page can be seen by clicking:<p>

Check What's New below for recent additions to Solarguard.<p> 

Canada is approaching the centennial of its Confederation. This is pretty good time to begin adding to this Solarguard webpage a Canadian section. The intent is to place here, as that date approaches, articles and reviews on the theme of Canadian history, current affairs and awesome future potential. The section is launched with Michael McKenny's short article on the vision of Ralph Centennius' 1883 vision of Canada and Michael McKenny's letter to Canada's prime minister on the subject of housing veterans. October 2010.<p> 

Peace, Michael.<p>
