Sipping Master Chuang

One of the most influential and charming writers from ancient China is
Chuang Tzu. He lived in the 4th Century C.E. Here is a personal response
to this illuminating soul, a poetic rendition of what most struck me of
his first fifteen books. It is hoped in the course of time to complete this for
his whole work.<p>

A fish called Vast, a bird, the Roc,
Cicadas teaching doves to fly;
Eight thousand years tree reaches high;
The soaring sun dims torches walk.

Who bald will pay hat seller's fee?
The secret cream is straw or gold?
A useless tree and shade that's old.
What's useless continues to be.

To lose the self, to master breath,
To understand what words convey,
To know, to see, to walk the way,
Surpassing horses racing death.

A hair greater than hills can seem.
A captive girl becomes a queen.
All life is one and changing seen.
I dream or I'm butterfly's dream?

A life's finite, too short to learn.
A bird declines a regal cage.
Cutting oxen the cook's a sage.
Where goes the fire after the burn.

The Way is one away from fame.
To walk and not to touch the ground.
To hear above the spoken sound.
To balance yin and yang the aim.

Though feather-light retain your joy.
Though hard as earth, escape from grief.
Recruiters give the maimed relief.
None will a useless tree destroy.

Balancing virtue bright and clear,
Wanders a sage, unplanned, a balm.
Behold a face in waters calm.
The pine is green throughout the year.

To breathe from feet, not only throat.
Arriving here, demanding not;
Departing life, having forgot
Success, failure -- nothing to note.

One hides inside his boat his net,
Conceals within a pool his craft.
His net, his boat robbers will waft.
To sit, not feel, and all forget.

Follow a king following rules.
Tell not a gnat to lift a hill.
A sage's will is change or still.
Seek not and all becomes your tools.

To use virtue as building bricks
Is stretching duck or shrinking crane.
The same to die for fame or gain.
The sage to nature firmly sticks.

To run in fields, the horses way.
No use have they for golden hall.
To be content, the way of all.
Before we learned to strive, to stray.

Have scales and thieves will steal with scales.
Have bows and higher rises bird.
Have snares and further races herd.
Have calm; regain ancestral trails. 

To master self, to leave the world alone,
To seek the stillness deep in soundless night.
A sage's traceless dance shadows the right.
His soul's alert, unseen, unheard, unknown.

Not fooled a sage by blame or praise,
Nor swayed by hues, by flavours five.
No mantis he; let wheels arrive.
Who got the pearl Yellow displays?

A sage is still and moves above.
The void is filled with calm and peace.
Amongst the trees and seas, let's cease
The deeds; let's reach a speechless love.

The tune produces awe, arousing fear.
The tune proceeds to sleep and yielding you.
Confucion's next, bewildered you are too.
Bewildered bear the Way afar and near.

A stainless crow as black remains.
A boat, not wheels, will ride the wave.
The ancient kings inside the grave,
Abode ago. This year its rains.

Humble, brave, selfless, true and pure,
Dwelling at lake and cave,
A quiet sage has ceased to crave,
A breath, a virtue midst verdure.<p>

A light unseen, a life unmired,
Above a mountain, calm as lake,
A sage at ease, asleep, awake,
Naught prized, just purity aspired.
