HISTORY OF FIVE INDIAN NATIONS, Cadwallader Colden, Allerton, New
York, Vol. Two 1973, 1922 (c.1746).

As in the summary of volume one, Five (Six) Nations or translated
terms are used in place of derogatory names. Thus, Longhouse People
(Haudenosaunee) and Flint Folk (Kanyen'kehaka) for Snakes (Iroquois)
and Cannibals (Mohawks), except in direct quotations. Dates in this
summary have been abbreviated according to British form. Some typos,
incomplete editing of dates from old to new style or whatever exist
in the edition of the book consulted by this reader.

(pp.1-5) Petition signed by twenty merchants objecting to 17/11/1720
trade ban against French. Asserted Five Nations trade adversely
affected, as French allies separate Five Nations and English.

30/4/1724 (pp. 6-7) covering letter referring above petition to
"Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantations" p. 7

7/7/1724 (pp. 7-9) Minute of Commissioners summing up petitioners'
objection to ban renewal.

14/7/1724 (pp. 9-13) Objections and Governor Burnet's claim Natives
coming far to Albany. Commission decides informing governor of
petition and awaiting his response.

6/11/1724 (pp. 13-32) Report of New York Council concerning trade
ban with France and her allies. Geographical clarification that no
French allies separate New York and the Six (Tuscaroras added)
Nations:

   The Mohawks (called Annies by the French) one of the Five
   Nations, live on the South-side of a Branch of Hudson's-River,
   (not on the North-side, as they are placed in the French Maps)
   and but forty Miles directly West from Albany, and within the
   English Settlements, some of the English Farms upon the same
   River being thirty Miles further West.

   The Oneidas (the next of the Five Nations) lie likewise West from
   Albany, near the head of the Mohawks-River, about one Hundred
   Miles from Albany.

   The Onondagas lie about one Hundred and Thirty Miles West from
   Albany. And the Tuscaroras lie partly with the Oneidas, and
   partly with the Onondagas.

   The Cayugas are about one hundred and sixty Miles from Albany.

   And the Sennekas (the furthest of all these Nations) are not
   above two hundred and forty Miles from Albany. pp. 15-16

Beaver remains plentiful. Banned are goods (mostly rum and strouds
easier for England to sell cheaper) to French Indians. Now forty
English traders are among the Natives learning their languages and
ways.

   This Government has built a publick Trading-house upon Cataraqui
   Lake, at Iondequat in the Sennekas Land, and another is to be
   built next Spring, at the Mouth of the Onondagas River. p. 26

Many tribes are now contacting New York. Merchants' motivation is
likely personal gain, not public good; they are like arms traders to
enemy in wartime. Let the petition be printed and merchants admit or
disown it publically. Colden was among seven men signing this
report.

10/11/1724 (pp 33-57) Memorial by Colden to Governor Burnet on the
fur trade, noting French map claiming land from the mouth of the
Mississippi to the mouth of the St. Lawrence, canoe transport of
goods, French scattered forts, Canada's barrenness and French
dependence on Native trade.

French priests actively promote French interests and denigrate the
English. Some Kanyen'kehaka have settled near Montreal. Navigation
along the St. Lawrence and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence is difficult.
Goods and licences cost more in Canada than in New York. The French
lack rum and sell inferior brandy at higher price. Navigation is
much better to New York and up the Hudson. France imports many
strouds from Albany to Montreal. Movement of goods is easier from
Albany than from Montreal.

When the English arrived in New York, the Five Nations were fighting
France and her allies, limiting English trade. A Catholic governor
of New York urged the Five Nations to peace with France, to accept
Jesuits and he permitted the building of Ft. Cataraqui. France now
has two warships on Cataraqui Lake. In peace time Major McGregory
and forty men were captured and maltreated by the French.

   for the French used these People as Slaves in building Cataraqui
   Fort p. 50

The French sent captives from a surprised Five Nations village near
Fort Cataraqui to the galleys in France and attacked the Senecas in
peace time, though taking heavier losses than the defenders. The
Five Nations then struck Montreal Island killing hundreds. The
French attacked Schenactady. Later, during Queen Anne's War, two
failed British invasions of Canada lessened Five Nations esteem for
England. The Natives at Kahnuaga might move back if trade from
Albany is stopped, as this trade is their sole livelihood.

In conclusion, economic advantages for the fur trade lie with New
York, which in addition has great potential for hemp and timber.

1740 (pp. 57-59) Letter mentioning the English trading post at
Osneigo (mouth of the Onondaga River).

July 1742 (pp. 61-116) Six Nations treaty held at Philadelphia. This
begins with mention of a deal six years earlier to sell Susquehannah
Valley to Pennsylvania and half of the purchase goods awaiting
removal by the Six Nations.

2/7/1742 Preliminary meeting Canassateego disavowed land sale by two
rebuked warriors, now informed only Pennsylvania could buy this
land. Two strouds received for it were handed over to Pennsylvanian
delegates.

Governor Thomas thanked him and then related an account of two White
scalps found in the bags of two Twightwies visiting some Shawnee.
The Twightwies promptly departed. Had the Six Nations information
about this, or could they look into it? Canassateego promised to.

5/7/1742 after dining and toasting, there was an enquiry about the
absence of the Senecas. Canassateego replied this was because of the
famine in their country. There was a question about Haudenosaunee
action if war broke out between France and England. Canassateego
answered that France was readying war, that Canada was urging Six
Nations neutrality, but the Six Nations would honour their old
alliance with England. He inquired about England's war with Spain.
Governor Thomas answered that it was going very well.

The Governor asked about the Six Nations doings west and south and
at Albany. The answer was that the Six Nations got along well with
peoples to the west and had sent two sets of envoys just now one to
Albany and one to the south.

6/7/1742 Many meet (some ninety Natives are named on pages 76-79).
Governor Thomas had the list of goods read and said these could be
delivered wherever the Natives wished. He proceeded with references
to the coming war, to the kindness of William Penn and his son, to
strengthening the chain of friendship and of each keeping the other
informed. He gave wampum string and wampum belt.

Canassateego next day spoke of the kindness of William Penn and his
son, renewed the friendship chain, stated that the numbers present
called for an increase in goods provided, asked that settlers on
other lands be removed, raised again the issue of European settlers
from lands south of Pennsylvania.

   It is customary with us to make a Present of Skins, whenever we
   renew our Treaties. We are ashamed to offer our Brethren so few,
   but your Horses and Cows have eat the Grass our Deer used to feed
   on. p. 88

The Governor replied an increase might be given as a present, that
land increased in value because of improvements made by White People
and that magistrates had gone to remove illegal settlers.
Interrupted, he was told magistrates were in collusion with settlers
and surveying Native land. The Governor promised to take care of
this situation and to write again to the governor of Maryland.

8/7/1742 (pp. 91-93) minute of Pennsylvania council meeting
approving the present and the letter to the governor of Maryland.

9/7/1742 (pp. 93-97) minutes of Pennsylvania council meeting.
Governor spoke on report from Canassateego of Shickalamy's assurance
the person who beat William Webb in 1740 had been chastised.
Governor Thomas accepted this, reminding Canassateego that two
Whites who killed a Native were publically hung. Canassateego said
he heard those guys had gone to another colony and it may be better
in future to ensure Native witnesses are at such public executions.
He added that the governor should thank the Shawnee for their action
and ensure they know they ought also to have held those Twightwies
until they'd had the full account of those scalps.

9/7/1742 meeting with chiefs. The governor's complaint re behaviour
of Natives at Delaware Forks.

10/7/1742 minutes of Pennsylvania council meeting. Quoted letter to
Maryland governor approved; payment authorized for translator Conrad
Weiser.

10/7/1742 meeting with the chiefs. Governor offers present. List of
goods given read. Canassateego expressed thanks.

12/7/1742 meeting with chiefs. Canassateego says from documents he
sees Delaware in the wrong. He spoke very harshly to Delaware
present, expressing his surprise and displeasure to learn Delaware
had sold land more than fifty years ago and more recently renewed
the sale, all this secretly. He told them to move at once "to Wyomen
or Shamokin" pp. 107-108 He expressed gratitude and concern for aged
infirm James Logan who had come out of retirement to attend this
treaty. He asked for attention to traders and noted that if scarcity
causes increased prices, then the scarcity of deer (caused by White
settlement) should enhance the value of deerskins.

He presented skins for James Logan, rum, cleaning the house where
they stayed, the valued interpreter, for the road.

Governor Thomas stated wagons and provisions were waiting, lauded
this additional demonstration of Six Nations justice and agreed as
to the deserving interpreter, whom Pennsylvanians also would reward.

12/7/1742 minute of Pennsylvania council meeting approving
additional costs of travelling expenses, etc.

22/6/1744 Governor of Pennsylvania and delegates of Maryland and
Virginia welcome Six Nations envoys and set meeting in three days.

25/6/1744 AM Governor Thomas: Virginia militia and warriors clashed.
Pennsylvania offers mediating role, compensation. Maryland delegate:
surprised to learn of Six Nations claim, but will pay for land long
ceded.

26/6/1744 Canassateego: Native land claims are very old. Whites were
advised as soon as the Six Nations learned, less than ten years ago,
of White intrusions on these lands.

27/6/1744 AM Virginia's envoys requested details of any Six Nations
claim to the disputed land.

27/6/1744 PM Tachanoontia's reply included:

   All the World knows we conquered the several Nations living on
   Sasquahannah, Cohongoronta, and on the Back of the Great
   Mountains in Virginia; the Conoy-uch-such-roona,
   Coch-now-was-roonan, Tohoa-irough-roonan and
   Connutskin-ough-roonan, feel the Effects of our Conquest, being
   now a Part of our Nations, and their Lands at our Disposal. We
   know very well, it hath often been said by the Virginians, that
   the Great King of England, and the People of that Colony,
   conquered the Indians who lived there, but it is not true. We
   will allow they have conquered the Sachdagughroonaw, and drove
   back the Tuscarroraws, and that they have, on that Account, a
   Right to some Part of Virginia; but as to what lies beyond the
   Mountains, we conquered the Nations residing there, and that
   Land, if the Virginians ever get a good Right to it, it must be
   by us; and in Testimony to the Truth of our Answer to this Part
   of your Speech, we give you this String of Wampum. pp. 149-150

Despite previous agreements, settlers intrude. They should go back,
or pay a portion of their harvest.

28/6/1744 AM Governor Thomas: We have the murderer of a trader. An
accomplice escaped. He should come to a fair trial. A few other
Natives can come to ensure the trial is fair. Stolen goods should be
returned.

28/6/1744 PM Maryland does not accept the land claims, but offers
payment for friendship's sake. Virginia asserts Five Nations ceded
all land to the English king. While Natives agreed not to go east of
the Great Mountains, no such agreement stops Whites going west. Only
the English king has the authority to remove settlers.

29/6/1744 Canassateego renounces land claim to Maryland.

30/6/1744 AM Gachradodow: God placed the ocean between Natives and
Whites. Natives remember great things. We do not remember being
conquered by the English king. We made peace with the Cherikees. The
Catawbas are deceitful and have deceived Virginia. Your settlers are
rich from our land. They should share food with those they made
poor. We have not seen the goods you mention.

30/6/1744 PM Gashradodow, a Cayuga chief, presents the name
Tocarry-hogan ("excellency" p. 172 to Maryland's governor.
Canassateego and thirteen other chiefs marked and sealed the deed
ceding land to Maryland.

2/7/1744 AM Several other Native leaders and interpreter Conrad
Weiser sign the deed. Canassateego: we didn't mention three murdered
Indians in Ohio. You hold the trader's murderer. We will ask the
Delaware to escort the other two, not as prisoners, to observe your
justice and bring them home. Some of the traders goods were
returned. We'll ask for you the rest, or its value. The Conoy people
driven to Shamokin have not received your reply to their appeal.

Governor Thomas: action on the murdered trader is good. Otherwise
trading might halt, except for more expensive French trade. I will
ensure justice for the two brought. I had not heard of the three
killed in Ohio. We did execute two Whites for killing two Indians.
Keep me informed and justice will be done.

2/7/1774 Virginians offer goods, gold, wagons, provisions and urging
the king recompense any further settlement. Canassateego and other
chiefs sign the deed.

3/7/1774 Governor Thomas: there is war. England has won battles on
land and sea. May the Six Nations prevent attacks through their
territory against us. Virginia: we offer goods, renewing friendship.
We offer to educate a few of your children.

4/7/1774 Canassateego: already we forbade the French from attacking
you through our land. We obtained the neutrality of the Catholic
Kanyen'kehaka. We'll make peace with wise Catawbas who come to us.
We love our children at home. Let our messengers pass to the
Tuscaroras. Let Conoy who want come to us. We would give more skins,
but settlers' cattle eat grass making deer scarce. We recommend you
follow the example of our federation.

Governor Thomas: thanks for removing the enmity of France's allies
and for your concern for colonial harmony. Virginia: we provide
passage for the Tuscaroras and for the Conoys.

1746 The governor of New York called a meeting with the Six Nations
to secure their participation in the projected invasion of Canada.
He thanked two Onondagas and one Oneida who brought him the scalp of
two French soldiers and related how these were obtained near a
French fort. Scouts reported a large French and allied force near
Crown Point. Kanyen'kehaka loyalty to England was doubted. Rangers
refused to scout without high pay.

The Cayugas refused to attend the meeting. Thirteen days brought no
response from the Oneidas. Reports came of western warriors eager to
fight the French. William Johnson energetically encouraged Flint
Folk to back England, but there was strong sentiment for neutrality.
Also, those who came to the meeting criticized those Kanyen'kehaka
who had responded to Johnson for premature and unilateral action.
The governor met Haudenosaunee leaders privately in small groups.
Colden met with two Kanyen'kehaka least in favour of backing England
and won them over.

The governor consulted some Native leaders on his prepared speech
and on their recommendation left out a reference to a defeated
rebellion across the ocean.

On the illness of the interpreter, it was decided to substitute a
leading Kanyen'kehaka. Native leaders explained the Kanyen'kehaka
were seen as biased for England and it would be more effective to
employ another. An Oneida leader was chosen. He did well.

19/8/1746 Colden: the sick governor asked me to speak for him. In
his words I renew the covenant chain. I told you of French attacks
and of our taking their strongest fort, Louisburg. You promised to
help, if the French attacked here. They have. It's time to keep your
word. The king has ordered an all out attack on Canada by land and
sea. He asks you to join this. You recall French deceit, unprovoked
attacks and your ancestors' revenge against Montreal Island. I
expect you'll emulate ancestral example.

23/8/1746 An Onondaga leader: we are now at war with the French and
their allies. Messesagues envoys are here representing eight hundred
fighting men eager to join us. Colonists: there are presents for you
from the king, Virginia and Massachusets.

24/8/1746 Colonists: here are presents. Wagons, clothing and
provisions shall be given to those who assemble. A Kanyen'kehaka
leader added that the governor of Canada did not treat his allies so
well. The Natives replied that they could not in return offer what
they wished, as hunting had been poor, or (the Kanyen'kehaka) they
had been so busy scouting for the English they could not hunt.

The two Messesaggue delegates died of sickness.

21/8/1746 Colden for the governor to the Esopus and Minissink
People: we renew the covenant chain. We invite you to join us and
the Six Nations in attacking Canada.

26/8/1746 Natives: we renew the covenant chain and join the war.
They did the war dance. Seven hundred Kanyen'kehaka were present, a
drain on provisions. Twenty Natives had smallpox.

On September 26, 1746 Susquehannah arrived. On the eighth of the
same month (sic) the governor welcomed them with words like those
given to the Six Nations.

9/9/1746 Susquehannah: we'd have come earlier had you invited us
sooner. We'll fight the French. We'll bring six hundred warriors.
Soon, sixteen Susquehannah rushed to avenge the death of an English
sergent killed by surprise. Two colonial men went with them and
prevented English troops firing on them by mistake.

   After the Six Nations left Albany, many of them were taken sick
   on their Way Home, before they reached the Mohawk Castles, and a
   considerable Number of the briskest young Men of the Mohawks
   died. p. 255

Native leaders reproved the English for pressing the attack and not
understanding mourning. A party of sixty went out to strike secretly
into Canada. The English commander got smallpox and five men carried
him home. Another small party was sent out and to date there's been
no word of it.

The governor of Canada asked the Cahnuagas about Six Nations
hostility and asked them to warn off the Six Nations. They declined,
saying such threats would only enrage the Six Nations. Kanyen'kehaka
mobilized even their old men. Weiser, the interpreter, arrived
without even one Susqehannah.

In conclusion the Six Nations and our regular army will be
unstoppable.

2/12/1746 New York. One party attacked a French settlement near
Montreal and brought eight prisoners; another met the French
governor and brought his letter and prisoner and a scalp taken
later.

Pages 267-387 are Pennsylvanian colonial charters, etc. However
interesting, they are less specifically connected to the
Haudenosaunee, although pages 331-333 (from an agreement between
William Penn and his proprietors dated 11/7/1682) are noteworthy for
stating Native equality: Natives are to enjoy the same rights as
planters, they are not to be defrauded by inferior goods, goods may
be only sold to Natives in public markets and after being assessed
of good quality, any Native-planter dispute is to be resolved by a
body of twelve, six Natives, six planters, any offences against
Natives are to be punished as such an offence against a planter.
