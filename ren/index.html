<H1>Renaissance</H1>

<p>Many strands form the tapestry of modern Western thought, theory and constantly unfolding reality. The revitalization of economies in Italy and Northwestern Europe are among the most significant of such constituent elements. A reconnection with Classical civilization, literature, art, humanistic ideals danced with mercantile concerns in patterns reincarnated down to the present generation.<p>

The topic is vast, embracing influences from the Hanseatic League, the Byzantines, the Sicilians, Twelfth Century Latin literature and culture, and the life and thought of the glorious Islamic civilization. The theme shines with the central glory of Renaissance Italy and includes the artistic and financial heritage grasped and held high by the Dutch and English, whence much that is called American and Western.<p>

At present this section offers: a brief outline of a translation of Dante's Divine Comedy and of Aretino's Selected Letters, summaries of translations of the first half of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, Machiavelli's The Prince, Guicciardini's History of Italy, Vespasiano's Lives, Vasari's Lives of the Artists volume one and Benvenuto Cellini's Autobiography; it presents as well summaries of five significant modern works about the Renaissance and a link to the valuable Perseus Renaissance resource page.<p> 

This section was last updated on November 6, 2008 C.E. with the addition of a brief summary of the introduction to the second volume of George Bull's Penguin translation of Vasari's Lives of the Artists.<p>
