<h2>THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF SOUTHEAST ASIA v. 1, Part 1, From Early Times
to c. 1500</h2>

<P>Cambridge University Press, Singapore, 1999 (1992)

<P>Chapter One, "The Writing of Southeast Asian History", looks at the
individuals, organizations and journals interested in the history of the
region over the generations with the varying perceptions and goals of
colonial administrators, Cold War scholars and academics in newly
independent states. It considers the issues of interest to Post War
historians: e.g. autonomy and outside influences, Indian, Islamic and
European, early history, traditional political theory, new elites,
national resistence movements, governmental organizations in newly
independent states, etc. There are pages of detail not very relevant to
this earliest paperback volume. Page 46 does introduce the reader to
Berg's position:

<blockquote>That the so-called historical writings of Java, the
   fourteenth-century NAGARAKERTAGAMA, the possibly older PARARATON and
   the later BABAD TANAH JAWI, were not works of history at all and
   could only be understood if read within the framework of the spirit
   which produced them. p. 46</blockquote>

<P>It also mentions the view that he overstated his case.

<P>Chapter Two, "Southeast Asia Before History", begins by stating the
vastness and complexity of the topic.

<blockquote>Throughout this region were represented, before the appearance of the
   historical records 2,000 years ago, societies of many socio-economic
   levels -- from hunters and gatherers, through tribal
   agriculturalists, to socially ranked chiefdoms fully conversant with
   the manufacture of artifacts of bronze and iron. Cutting across these
   socio-economic levels were considerable variations in languages and
   human biology, all reflecting many millennia of adaptation,
   innovation, colonization and contact between populations.  p. 55</blockquote>

<P>It considers the present environment as well as fluctuations caused by
climatic change. One of the most important variations is the coastline.

<blockquote>The Sunda Shelf is the largest area of shallowly submerged
   continental shelf on earth. When it was almost fully exposed as dry
   land during glacials it would have formed a subcontinent over four
   million square kilometres in extent. p. 62 This means that Java and
   Sumatra may have been joined to Asia for well over half and possibly
   even 90 per cent of Middle and Late Pleistocene time, Borneo for
   perhaps less. p. 64</blockquote> 

<p>It mentions the presence of Homo erectus and the debate concerning
genetic continuity or replacement. It looks at biological and genetic
perspectives, reminding the reader of the independence of these from
language. 

<blockquote>Most of the Philippine Negritos have now adopted sporadic
   agricultural practices and all have adopted, within recent millennia,
   Austronesian languages from neighbouring cultivators. The Semang of
   Malaysia, while still primarily hunter-gatherers and forest
   collectors-for-trade, have at some time adopted Austroasiatic
   languages related to ancestral Mon and Khmer. The few remaining
   Andamanese, some of whom live in virtual island isolation, are the
   only ones to have retained a relatively pure foraging economy
   together with their original languages, unrelated to any outside
   major grouping. pp. 74-75</blockquote>

<p>The chapter refers to skeletal remains;

<blockquote>Nowhere is there clear-cut evidence from them for rapid population
   replacement, and we must allow for millennia of intermarriage and
   local evolution. The important concept is that human biological
   history of Southeast Asia has involved not a swift replacement of
   some populations by others, but a gradual southwards and eastwards
   shift in the structure and centre of gravity of a cline between
   Southern Mongoloids and Australo-Melanesians. p. 76</blockquote>

<p>It examines hunter-gatherers and various sites, often caves, across
Southeast Asia. These include the Niah caves on Sarawak.

<blockquote>It has produced edge-ground axes made on pebbles which may be over
   10,000 years old; these represent an important technological
   innovation which also appeared, presumably independently, in Late
   Pleistocene contexts in Japan, northern Australia and the New Guinea
   Highlands. p. 83</blockquote>

<p>Here also are flexed or sitting posture burials and:

<blockquote>The cave inhabitants were also able to hunt or scavange meat from no 
   less than fifty-eight species of mammals, including primates,
   carnivors, and herbivors ranging in size from small rodents to
   rhinoceros and cattle. p. 84</blockquote>

<p>It mentions Hoabinhian sites across the Southeast Asian mainland and in
Malaysia and Sumatra. It also refers to the debate concerning their
connection with the development of agriculture and pottery.

<blockquote>In terms of basic archaeological data, evidence for Hoabinhian
   occupation and burial activities occurs mainly in limestone caves and
   shelters. There are also a few coastal shell middens dating from
   after 8000 years ago in northern Sumatra, western peninsular Malaysia
   and northern Vietnam; any older than this would have been destroyed
   by rising sea levels. p. 87</blockquote>

<p>It mentions the dog domesticated and introduced from India or China.

<p>The chapter proceeds to examine the development of agriculture, noting
the lack of certainty as to precisely how and why this happened. It
states that New Guinea was one place (along with Peru, Mexico, West Asia
and China) where hunter-gatherers developed agriculture. However, most
of Southeast Asia seems to have received it by diffusion, although the
climate of the region may have led to variations, for example, less use
of rice and more of millets, tubars, bananas, etc. in the islands.

<p>It continues with reference to sites in Thailand, remarking that
previous very early dates for Thai agriculture have been revised. There
is a lack of concensus on whence agriculture arrived in such places as
Non Nok Tha and Ban Chiang, whether from the South China/North
Vietnamese coast or from the Gulf of Thailand. There is also a paucity
of information on settlements and house plans.

<blockquote>Ephemeral timber architecture rarely survives in readily-identifiable
   post-hole patterns in the tropics, a circumstance which puts this
   region at an archaeological disadvantage compared with more temperate
   environments in China and Europe. pp. 98-99</blockquote>

<p>It describes the rich site at Khok Phanum Di, and states that Burma,
Cambodia and Laos provide little useful data here. However, Ban Kao some
two hundred kilometres west of Hok Phanum Di has given its name to a
culture that reached, "Southwards for 1500 kilometres into central
peninsular Malaysia." p. 100 Its remains include tripods.

<blockquote>The southward expansion of the Ban Kao culture, most probably by
   movement of people rather than by trade or superficial diffusion,
   appears to have led to three major introductions into southern
   Thailand and Malaysia; agriculture, Austroasiatic languages, and gene
   flow of Southern Mongoloid origin." p. 101</blockquote>

<p>It suggests movement from South Coastal China to Taiwan, mentions the
similarities of the Yuanshan culture of eastern Taiwan to finds in the
Philippines, reiterates the negative consequences of tropical conditions
for archaeological remains.

<blockquote>From the central Philippines southwards into Indonesia and east
   Malaysia the Early Neolithic archaeological record consists mainly of
   pottery, flaked-stone tools, very rare adzes, and little else. p. 
   104</blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, this, along with examination of pollen, leads to the
thought,

<blockquote>That pottery-using people, circumstantially with varied agricultural
   economies, settled large parts of Southeast Asia during the third
   millennium BC. p. 105</blockquote>

<p>The chapter turns now to language. The presence of several language
families in the suggested Austronesian homeland of South China/Taiwan,
the widespread extent of Austronesian and its failure to penetrate
deeply into New Guinea, already inhabited by agriculturalists,
comparative phonological and grammatical research, etc. cause the author
to see language as corroborating the archaeological thought quoted in
the above paragraph.

<p>Next comes a look at metals, providing a separate Bronze Age on the
mainland, but bronze and iron arriving together in the islands after 500
BCE. 

<blockquote>Bronze, all over Southeast Asia, does appear to have had a
   significant correlation with the rise of ranked societies in
   pre-Indic times, and weapons, vessels and ornaments of the metal were
   probably exchanged between regional elites for purposes of alliance
   and inter-marriage. p. 116</blockquote>

<p>There follows a brief examination of sites in northern Thailand (Ban Na
Di, Ban Chiang and Ban Chiang Hian) and Vietnam (Doc Chua, Dong-son,
Viet Khe, Co Loa)

<blockquote>The early iron-bearing layers in Ban Chiang have also produced the
   remarkable red-painted pottery with its outstanding repertoire of 
   curvilinear designs, a style which seems to have been absent from Ban
   Na Di, despite the geographical closeness of the two sites. p. 
   119</blockquote>

<p>The most impressive archaeological remain from Vietnam is the Dong-son
bronze drum. Such drums, described in fascinating detail, seem to have
been developed in northern Vietnam and to have been important items
throughout much of insular Southeast Asia, until c. 300 CE.

<blockquote>It must not be assumed that these drums were made only for funerary
   purposes, despite their common occurrance in burials. H.
   Loofs-Wissowa has recently surveyed a number of possible functions,
   including the possibility that they were bestowed as legitimizing
   'regalia' on local chiefs by a religious authority in northern
   Indochina. pp 122-123</blockquote>

<p>This section also refers to:

<blockquote>Evidence in Chinese records to the effect that canal-irrigated rice
   fields were present in northern Vietnam before 111 BC...In addition,
   a Chinese census of 2 CE records a population of almost one million
   people in northern Vietnam. p. 125</blockquote>

<p>The author turns to the islands, repeating the caution about the paucity
of evidence and inferring from Lapita pottery and linguistics,

<blockquote>Colonization of a 5000 kilometre spread of islands from the vicinity
   of New Guinea through to Samoa during the late second millennium BC.
   p. 128</blockquote>

<p>The chapter continues with island megaliths, including those at
Pageralam. It surveys the evidence from Sembiran, Bali, suggesting this
was an Indian trading post 2,000 years ago.

<blockquote>When all these finds are put together, they hint very strongly at the
   oldest direct evidence from Southeast Asia for the trade in spices
   which linked the Roman empire, India and Southeast Asia in the first
   centuries of our era. p. 131</blockquote>

<p>Chapter Three, "The Early Kingdoms", briefly examines seven such
entities: Vietnam, Champa, Angkor, Pagan, Ayutthaya, Srivijaya and
Majapahit. The situation is more complex than may appear from that
simple list.

<p>Champa is described as a convenient term for various polities that
fluctuated along nearly a thousand kilometres of what is now the coast
of Vietnam. Chronologically, it may reach from the Chinese references in
the second century CE until Cham under-kings ceased to rule in Thuan Hai
in 1832.

<p>The section on Ayutthaya begins with Mangrai starting out in Chiang
Saen, moving to Fang, allied with other Thai rulers, including
Ramamhaeng of Sokothai. Mangrai founds the state of Lan Na and its
capital Chiangmai. In 1351, fifty three years after the death of
Ramamhaeng, Ayutthaya is founded. During the reign of Intharacha
(1409-1424), "Sukothai was effectively reduced to vassalage." p. 170
Meanwhile, Mangrai's successors developed a prosperous state in Lan Na.

<blockquote>Ku Na (1355-1385)...promoted a scolarly sect of Buddhist monks, that
   for many generations, became the leading religious, literary, and
   cultural influence in the region. pp. 171-172</blockquote>

<p>Ayutthaya in the late fifteenth century failed to subdue Lan Na. There
was another Thai kingdom called Lan Sang.

<blockquote>It covered a huge area from Luang Prabang in the north to Champassak
   in the south and most of what is today northeastern Thailand. p. 
   172</blockquote>

<p>And further complexity is suggested by the reference to the Thai
chiefdoms of the Tran-Ninh Plateau posing as vassals of both Dai Viet
and Lan Sang.

<p>The section on Angkor mentions the Chinese designations Fu-nan (2nd-6th
Cs CE) and Chen-la (6th-8th Cs CE), the archaeological site of Oc-eo.

<blockquote>Oc-eo was an entrepot from the second to the sixth centuries, and is
   generally associated with the 'Fu-nan' era of pre-Angkorean history.
   p. 158</blockquote>

<p>It mentions several military leaders, including Jayavarman II, who was
proclaimed king on a mountain near the site of Angkor in 802 CE. There
were several strong rulers, including Suryavarman II (r. 1113-c.1150 CE)
and Jayavarman VII (r. c.1170s-c.1220 CE) involved in vigorous military
activity, building and religious interest. Jayavarman VII, 
   
<blockquote>Is also credited with the building of roads, 121 rest houses, and 102
   hospitals throughout Angkorean territory. p. 162</blockquote>

<p>However, there generally were difficulties after the deaths of such
outstanding personalities and following an increase in the importance of
commerce Angkor was abandoned in the 1430s.

<p>Pagan, exerting dominance because of military prowess, then received
significant cultural influence from the conquered Mon, Pyu and from
sources beyond, including Sri Lanka. This cultural influence matures in
the reign of Kyanzittha (1084-1112 CE).

<p>Narapatisithu (c. 1173-1211 CE) purified the monasteries, increased his
tax base and ruled over an era of peace and prosperity. Successors were
less able to respond to the power of the monks and their weakness led to
internal division and external pressures.

<p>Srivijaya is described as, "A generic term for the succession of
thalassocracies centred in southeastern Sumatra from the seventh to the
fourteenth centuries." p. 173 It attracted hostile attention from India,
Java and Thailand, as well as the protective might of Ming China which,

<blockquote>Supported this interest with large naval patrols in the first two
   decades of the fifteenth century. p. 175</blockquote>

<p>Although the section on Majapahit describes capable rulers, a wise
adviser (Gaja Mada d. 1365 CE) and an ambitious political vision
("nusantara", archipelagic hegemony), these are presented in a rich
Javanese cultural background that harmonizes outside influences
(Buddhist, Hindu and, later, Islamic), that has a tradition of monarchs
renouncing the world, that presents the splendid architectural legacies
of Borobudor and Prambanan, that from the Tenth Century forward inspires
impressive poetry, drama and music.

<p>Vietnam is closest to the Chinese. Indeed, it was part of China during
Han, T'ang and, briefly, Ming times. The realm of Dai Viet was founded
by Ly Cong Van (r. 1009-1029). His son, Ly Phat Ma, published a new
legal code in 1042 and led a successful naval strike at the Cham capital
in 1044. Phat Ma's son, Ly Nhat Thon (r. 1054-1072),

<blockquote>Was a sophisticated and cultured man who was at once a scholar and a
   judge, a musician and a warrior, a devout Buddhist and a ruthless
   dynast. p. 144</blockquote>

<p>His young son, Ly Can Duc (r. 1072-1127) came to the throne as the
activist Sung reformer Wang An-shih considered moving against Dai Viet.
General Ly Thuong Kiet launched a potent pre-emptive strike and the Sung
counter-attack failed, although it resulted in recognition of the
Sino-Vietnamese border, "Which has remained essentially unchanged to the
present day." p. 147

<p>Ly Can Duc's successors were confronted with the power of the families
of consorts. In 1225 Tran Thu Do established a new dynasty whose queens
for the first four generations came from the Tran clan. This dynasty
adopted the Chinese examination system in the 1230s and defeated Mongol
invaders in the 1280s. Ming forces in the early 1400s defeated Ho Quy Le
and for a period they occupied Dai Viet. Following their withdrawal in
1428, the Le Dynasty emerged. Perhaps its most memorable ruler was Le
Thanh Ton (r. 1460-1497).

<blockquote>This was an unprecedented age of scholarship and literature;
   important works of poetry, folklore, history, law, and government
   were written and have survived. p. 151</blockquote>

<p>Regretably, five years after he died the kingdom entered a period of
civil wars, but they lie outside the time frame covered by this volume.

<p>Chapter Four, "Economic History of Early Southeast Asia", begins by
reminding the reader of the vital importance of this area for world
trade, of how Southeast Asians,

<blockquote>Were the nomads of the Southern Ocean, and they played a role in
   history that in some ways resembles that of the nomads of the
   northern steppe. p. 186</blockquote>

<p>The chapter outlines the expertise of these pre-literate people in
agriculture, metallurgy and navigation. It mentions their transport of
cinnamon, bananas and the xylophone in their wide ranging travels that
had them colonizing Madacascar by the time of the Roman Empire. They
were known as "Kunlun" to the Chinese of the 3rd Century BCE. They
likely initiated contact with India and they established colonies far
into the Pacific.

<p>Next comes a consideration of Fu-nan (present Oc-eo). This seaport in
the Mekong Delta, very favoured by agriculture, a necessity when winds
would require travellers to lay over, "For as long as five months," p.
193 had the legend of beginning its importance when an Indian brahmin,

<blockquote>Drank of the local waters...which suggests that he took an oath of
   loyalty to the local ruler" p. 193</blockquote> 

<p>whom he later married.  

<blockquote>By the second or third century CE, Fu-nan was both rich and powerful,
   and foreign visitors were numerous. Not only were there Indians and
   Chinese, but by the third century Persian Gulf sailors from the
   Sassanid empire in Persia could also be found in Fu-nan. p. 194</blockquote>

<p>It mentions also the third century report of cities in the islands and
of a king in Sumatra who imported horses from northwest India. It refers
to the dislocations in China with great migrations to southern China and
the closing in 439 CE of the Silk Road.

<blockquote>This China market was irresistable, and the seamen of the Sunda
   Strait region rose to the challenge, picking up the goods from the
   West in India and Sri Lanka, bringing them through Southeast Asia and
   then delivering them to this southern Chinese market. p. 196</blockquote>

<p>This leads to a consideration of the polity of Srivijaya. This section
begins by referring to the traditional belief in the divine nature of
the lofty mountains, the flat expanse of the sea and the rivers flowing
from the mountains to the sea. It mentions the natural advantages of the
Srivijayan port of Palembang in agricultural productivity, "A fine
natural harbour and a river that was navigable for long distances." pp.
199-200 There is another reference to the Malay water oath. The author
states that Srivijaya bought out pirates, hiring them for patrol and
transport.

<p>Next comes a look at the Javanese ally of Srivijaya. This impressive
state, with its outstanding site at Borobudur, likely contributed to
feeding visitors to Palembang. It mentions the committees organizing the
sharing of water for irrigation and the religious aspect of this
important work.

<blockquote>The behaviour of the gods, like the behaviour of the farmers, was
   shaped by the human planting cycles, for they came down to inhabit
   their shrines only on special days, usually related to the planting
   schedule. p. 205</blockquote>

<p>There is reference to the claims of the king to be supported by the
higher gods of the Indian religions, and also how India provided writing
and exalted Sanskrit concepts, including "Maharajah", "Great king".    

<p>Next comes consideration of East Java which by trading rice for cloves,
nutmeg and mace growing a thousand miles east so dominated the trade
that foreigners assumed these grew in Java. Airlanng (r. 1016-1049)
established the rule of Kahuripari. On his death his kingdom was divided
between two sons. These were the two realms of Singhasari and Kadiri.
Following a defeat of Singhasari by Kadiri in 1292, Raden Vijaya,
son-in-law of the late Singhasari king, founded the new capital of
Mahapahit. Mahapahit's rulers extended their influence.

<blockquote>Thus, by 1377 Mahapahit's realm included ports and their hinterlands
   from the furthest tip of Sumatra in the west to New Guinea in the
   east and as far north as the southern islands of the Philippines. p.
   219</blockquote>

<p>There is considerable description, much of it seemingly drawn from the
1365 epic NAGARAKERTAGAMA, of the prosperity of Mahapahit. Then comes
mention of the founding of Malacca in 1402 and its contact with the
Chinese admiral Ch'eng Ho three years later. This, combined with
simultaneous civil strife in Mahapahit, weakened the dominance of East
Java.

<p>The chapter turns to Angkor, its irrigation system, its belief in the
ritual connection of king and land, the acquisition of economic
resources by temples, even donors shifting goods and services from one
temple to another.

<blockquote>Through these actions, a pattern of subordination of one local deity
   to another as well as one local temple to another began to emerge in
   Khmer society. Regional temple networks came to be sustained and
   controlled by a secular, landed elite who transferred income from
   their lands or donated material goods and services to temples in the
   network. p. 233</blockquote>

<p>Royal authority and some details of temple organization mentioned,
including the rice requirements of the Ta Prohn temple for personnel,

<blockquote>Among whom were 615 female dancers, 439 learned hermits who lived in
   the temple monastery (asrama), and 970 students. p. 237</blockquote>

<p>The chapter moves on to Pagan where,

<blockquote>Status was defined by how much one gave to the Buddhist Church rather
   than the wealth one accumulated. Kings received merit and
   consequently legitimacy in return for their generosity. p. 242<P>

   The king's one recourse against the Church's wealth and power was the
   periodic 'purification' of the religious order, by which the king
   reduced the Buddhist sangha to small, localized, 'other-worldly'
   groups with a few material resources, which was under the control of
   a unified sangha elite directly appointed and supervised by the king.
   p. 244</blockquote>

<p>There follows consideration of Khmer and Burman expansion, the
involvement of Sri Langka and the Indian state of Cola, activity in the
Malay Peninsula, and the growing importance of war booty for the kings
of Angkor. This leads into the section on Champa, "Champa's
Plunder-Based Political Economy". There is reference to the similarity
between Champa and the islands in riverine networks.

<blockquote>Rather than representing shifts from one dynasty's rule to that of
   another, the periodic movement of the Cham royal centre (capital)
   among several river-mouth urban centres bearing Indic titles --
   Indrapura (Tra-kieu), Vijaya (Binh-dinh), and Kauthara (Nha-trang) --
   correspond to transfer of hegemony from the elite of one Cham river
   valley system to that of another. p. 253</blockquote>

<p>There is mention of the concept of "Ancestors of prowess." p. 254
Although Chinese sources describe Champa,

<blockquote>As the source of the quick-growing 'floating rice' that the Chinese
   adopted in southern China,</blockquote>

<p>Champa lacked the appropriate geography that so favoured some of its
contemporaries. The chapter describes Champa's plundering by land and
sea, even within Champa.

<p>Next comes a look at Vietnam. This section mentions the Han Chinese
presence, reinforced by refugees during the reign of Wang Mang.

<blockquote>Because of the high degree of male mobility in pursuit of game,
   Vietnamese society in the early Han era seemed, from the Chinese
   perspective, to have no stable family system. The male role in
   agriculture, or the lack thereof, and the apparent female control of
   cultivation, were difficult for Chinese administrators to accept. pp.
   261-262</blockquote>

<p>The Chinese encouraged private, rather than communal, ownership of land,
had their soldiers farming to be self-supporting and influenced more
permanent houses to be build both for the living and as ancestral
shrines. The chapter looks at developments during Sui and T'ang times
and the independence of Dai Viet in the 10th Century. An important trade
link since at least Han times, the now independent area continued to
play a trading role. Among interesting data on religious concepts,

<blockquote>In 1048, Ly Thai Tong (r. 1028-1054) revived a China-inspired cult of
   culture, in which the monarch was the highest officiant. As the
   symbolic source of fertility, the Vietnamese emperor led springtime
   rites in which he would plough the first furrows, and he also
   symbolically assisted in the gathering of rice at harvest. At the
   south gate of the Hon-lu capital, offerings were made to bring rain
   and to guarantee crops at the Esplanade of the Gods of the Soil and
   Harvest. p. 268</blockquote>

<p>Chapter Five considers religion. This chapter begins with a listing of
primary source material, including a statement of what is lacking.

<blockquote>In contrast with the rich literary sources for (northern) Vietnam,
   written in Chinese, we do not possess a single line of literature
   from ancient Cambodia, nor from Champa or the Philippines. For
   eastern Java there is a rich literature in old Javanese from the
   tenth century, and in Burma from the twelfth century, written in
   Pali, the sacred language of the Buddhist of the Theravada school.
   For western Malaysia, Sumatra and Thailand, the literary sources
   begin just before the end of the period under consideration. No
   literary sources are available for the remaining parts of Southeast
   Asia. p. 277</blockquote>

<p>Such literary sources, records of observers outside the region (e.g. Sri
Lankans and Chinese), epigraphy, archaeological remains and modern
animist beliefs are the bases for the attempted reconstruction of early
Southeast Asian religion.

<p>The section of this chapter titled "The Earliest Times" begins with a
consideration of Indianization. However, it discusses how the Indian
religions blended with local concepts: e.g. burial mounds became
Buddhist stupa, linga of the Cham territorial gods became linga of
Shiva, divine mountains became the abodes of Shiva and Brahma, tree
spirits acquired Buddhist aspects and local snake cults merged with
Hindu snake worship.

<p>There is reference to a variety of funeral practises in the region, to
ancestor worship in Chinese influenced Vietnam and to the absence of
evidence for human sacrifice in civilized areas of the region.

<p>The next section of this chapter examines, "Religions of Indian Origin
on the Mainland." It looks at the role of the brahmin, even in Buddhist
courts, "In astrological and ritual functions." p. 287 It considers the
cults of Shiva and Vishnu and then Buddhism.

<p>Next comes a consideration of the islands. Here mention is made of
Austronesian beliefs mingling with those from India and ceremonies, etc.
that harmonize both.    

<blockquote>Some typically Austronesian deities or supernatural powers are a
   crocodile with the name of Si Pamunguan and another aquatic monster
   called Tandang Luah, perhaps a river spirit, for luah = river...There
   is a crocodile by the name of Manalu, and there are different snakes
   (ulasarpa) and different fires (nala and apuy)...Some rivers were
   sacred...as were some mountains. p. 310</blockquote>

<p>There follows some lengthy consideration of Indian influenced temple
sites, some quite complex, in Southeast Asia. Next comes a look at the
concepts of the divinity of kings and the religious synceticism of
Southeast Asia. The author mentions the inexactitude of theories of
royal divinity, if the word divine is understood in the monotheistic
absolutist sense.

<blockquote>Third, even if kings were considered to some extent divine, they
   would have shared this 'divinity' with many other creatures,
   including some priests and cows, or even snakes and trees. p. 327</blockquote>

<p>He also cautions against hasty syncretic interpretations of such things
as Kertanagara (r. 1268-1292) being called Shiva-Buddha.

<blockquote>This is a unique occurrence...It is more likely that the king's
   memory was worshipped in a temple with both a Siva and a Buddha
   image.</blockquote>

<p>He proceeds to mention of a temple with these images on two different
floors, a sign of being in one building, but separated.

<p>Next he introduces the arrival of Islam. He notes that the rise of Islam
coincides with the decline of powerful Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms. He
mentions the conversion of the king of Malacca, the spread of Islam to
ports connected with Malacca, the legend of nine Muslim teachers to Java
and the adaptation of Islam to the ways of the islands. He states that
the arrival of Europeans may have fostered in some regions the growth of
Islam, perceived as a powerful force to resist the intruders.

<p>This is a tremendously fascinating read, highly recommended, especially
to those less conscious of the vast scope of the region's geography,
economy, culture, religion, history and pre-history. The single greatest
deficiency, in my opinion, is the absence of a section on the literature
of the Southeast Asians during this period. Mention is made of such
works, especially in the last chapter. However, a separate and more
comprehensive treatment both as primary historical sources and as
literature would have enhanced this fine modern text.
