THE TRIUMPH OF THE MOON, Ronald Hutton, Oxford University Press,
Oxford, 1999

Here is a brief synopsis of a truly outstanding work, replete with fascinating detail. If the menu below makes the mouth water, go ahead and dig into a very worthwhile book. 

This, "first full-scale scholarly study of the only religion England
has given the world: modern pagan witchcraft," begins with a preface
(pp. vii-xii) noting the emergence of this volume from the author's
previous works, his focus on influences on modern paganism and on the
history of modern paganism, his ethical response to documenting
mystery religion and special challenges that could even more seriously
impact less established scholars.

1. "Finding a Language"  (pp. 3-31): Pagan perhaps originally meant
civilian and was long associated with traditional local or rural
beliefs. European imperialists applied the term to those they
encountered and to the practises of prehistoric Europeans, although
Graeco-Roman civilization was esteemed, especially crowned with
enhancing Christianity. Considered are some concepts, such as a
universalist spiritualist system and of harmonious human connection
with nature and some special strands, e.g. Spiritualism and German
romanticism.

2. "Finding a Goddess" (pp. 32-42): Examined is the relative popularity
of Classical goddesses in Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century
English literature and the growth there and amongst prehistorians of
the concept of the Great Goddess.

3. "Finding a God" (pp. 43-51): The previous chapter is repeated in
male attire with the emphasis on Pan.

4. "Finding a Structure" (pp. 52-65): Freemasonry, especially those
aspects transmitted to Neopagan witchcraft, is presented, as are
various Masonic offshoots and other Masonic influenced organizations,
such as trade unions and insurance companies.

5. "Finding a High Magic" (pp. 66-83): Magic includes exercising will.
Magic and its symbols, such as the pentagram, have a long tradition.
presented are Rosicrucians, Theosophists, the Golden Dawn and its
harvest of splinters and offshoots, including Crowley.

6. "Finding a Low Magic" (pp. 84-111): There were ordinary magical
practitioners, literate, often curiously garbed, respected or feared by
many, though sometimes murdered. These overwhelminly were individuals,
not groups or covens, nor were they descended from craft families,
though some families did pass down a specific charm. Many charged a
fee, though some received payment in kind and some didn't want even
thanks. Police enforced laws against fortune telling and also against
mob violence, thus also protecting witches.

7. "Finding a Folklore" (pp. 112-131): Those (e.g. Fraser and Tyler)
suggesting rural pagan survivals were reacting against Christian
excess. Rational assertiveness contained a dread and excitement at the
concept of an underlying ectatic layer. This was found by folklorists
who selected, altered and interpreted evidence despite the objections
of venerable practitioners.

8. "Finding a Witchcraft" (pp. 132-150): The transition from a Europe
where some 40,000 to 50,000 (p. 132) people were executed for
witchcraft to one which viewed the offence as imaginary is one of the
key elements of rational modernity. Continental scholars and writers
described to excess the persecution of witchcraft and the ideal pagan
nature of the persecuted. Americans intensified this, Matilda Gage,
for example, stating with no substantiation that nine million were
killed, and Leland whose very influential ARADIA did not likely form
the sacred text of an authentic surviving witch cult.

9. "Matrix" (pp. 151-170): Such as Haggard, Kipling, Grahme and Yeats
wrote of paganism and magic, although in varying ways self identifying
as Christian. Even Yeats' concept for an Irish mystical order drawn
from mythological deities was envisioned as blended with Christianity.
Russell, keenly spiritual and yearning for a druidical revival, saw
Jesus as a great beneficial adept. Lawrence, in posthumous work,
connected Revelations to pagan mystery religion. Pagan ressonance
radiates from Westlake and his Woodcraft order, though this, too, was
presented as Christian. Harry (later Dion) Byngham was more
emphatically pagan.

10. "God (and Goddess) Parents" (pp. 171-201): Crowley had a perhaps
ambivalent attitude to religion. He was a significant and notorious
figure in the tradition of ritual magic. Dion Fortune, another
important complex figure, was more Christian. Robert Graves asserted
even his novels to be true. The eccentric, inventive Graves
encountered domineering women who inspired his fictional accounts of
Goddess and priestesses. Margaret murray quoted extensively, but
selectively, from records of witch trials. She ignored and dismissed
studied criticism of her flawed scholarship.

11 "Gerald Gardner" (pp. 205-240): This retired tea planter, naturist,
occultist, folklorist, novelist, druid met Crowley about reviving the
OTO. Gardner instead founded or continued a witchcraft group in the
New Forest, composed or edited a book of shadows, including initiatory
rituals for three degrees and references to ritual tools, nudity and
magic circle. Hutton explores origins for concepts and implements.

12. "Gerald's People" (pp. 241-252): With the 1951 repeal of laws
against witchcraft, Gardner became public. He joined Cecil Williamson
in working on an occult museum on the Isle of Man. Publicity attracted
Doreen Valiente, a poet and keen ritualist, who revised the Book of
Shadows. Publicity was also sensational. Doreen sought more secluded
activity and broke with Gardner. Dayonis appeared. An Olive Green
created some factional conflict. Other conflict is mentioned.

13 "The Wider Context: Hostility" (pp. 253-271): Twentieth Century
popular fiction, some written by occultists, conveyed apprehension
against witchcraft. Newspaper articles, some by popular lurid novelist
Dennis Wheatley, some others by retired "Fabian of the Yard" increased
sensational misinformation, contributing to police apprehending school
children collecting leaves for a nature studies class and to youthful
larks adopting a publicized satanic form. Both some considering
witchcraft ineffectual and some viewing it as harmfully satanic have
opposed it.

14. "The Wider Context: Reinforcement" (pp. 272-286): There continued
to be popular works by such authors as Mary Renault and Rosemary
Sutcliffe providing a positive image of a matriarchal peaceful
prehistory. These derived inspiration from academic work, though from
the 1960s British prehistorians had been pulling back from this
unproven concept.

15. "Old Craft, New Craft" (pp. 287-308): Among claimants to
preGarnderian Wiccan tradition are Bill Liddell, Charles Cardell,
Raymond Howard, Sybil Leek, Rhiannon Ryall, "Bob," and John P.
Williams. Neopagan witchcraft seems to derive from Gardner.

16. "The Man in Black" (pp. 309-318): Cochrane for a few years in the
mid 60s played a prominent role before his tragic death. This
included bickering with Garnerians and participating in the shattering
of efforts to create harmony among different Wiccan groups.

17. "Royalty From the North" (pp. 319-339): Alex and Maxine Sanders,
rebuffed by Gardnerians and prompted by attacks to assert a separate
more authentic tradition, became prominent in the mid and late 60s.
Favourable witchcraft publicity turned hostile in 1969, but targeting
Garderians, not the Sanders. Arthur Stewart Farrar joined the Sanders
and coined the tradition's impressive name, Alexandrian. The Sanders
blurred their tradition's paganism. Voices emerged recommending
solitary exploration of the Craft. The Sanders separated and Alex
became much less public a figure.

18. "Uncle Sam and the Goddess" (pp. 340-368): America had its own
early traditions. Witchcraft attracted feminists, some (Dianics)
participating only with other women. Starhawk, highly literate,
intensely activist, exerted enormous influence. Scientist James
Lovelock contributed a Gaia consept. Maija Gimbutas continued the
concept of prehistoric peaceful matriarchy. America provided chants
and folksongs. Despite British academics doubting the prehistoric
Goddess religion (while accepting the significance of prehistoric
goddesses) and questioning impressions about the witch trials, the
American concepts swept through British feminism and paganism.
Factually incorrect as some concepts were, the overall impact of
American activist feminist witchcraft was attraction and empowerment
of many British women.

19. "Coming of Age" (pp. 369-388): Margot Adler's DRAWING DOWN THE MOON
brought impressive intellectual vigour to Wiccan publication, though
this was not read by most British Wiccans. After Alex Sanders died in
1988, a closer coming together of the rich diversity of traditions
occurred, though discordant notes existed. Among a number of
influential pagan writers is Vivianne Crowley. Popular media
demonstrated greater awareness of and sensitivity to modern paganism.

20. "Grandchildren of the Shadows" (pp. 389-416): The Pagan Federation
defined pagan belief as seeing nature as divine, rejecting the concept
of divine law codes and accepting the divine feminine.
   I would now like to add five more features of modern pagan
   witchcraft, based upon my own observations of it, which are not
   usually identified by its practitioners but seem to me to be
   important. First, it aims to draw out and enhance the divinity
   within human beings. Second, it abolishes the traditional Western
   distinction between religion and magic. Third, it is a mystery
   religion, or set of mystery religions. Fourth, its essence lies in
   the creative performance of ritual. Fifth, it is eclectic and
   protean. p. 391

Hutton considers membership figures, drop out rates, remoteness of
modern witchcraft from negative popular stereotypes and from most
academic definitions, such as sect, cult, new religious movement and
post modern religion. Revived religion is perhaps most apt.
