Titus Livius

Titus Livius (59 B.C.E.-17 C.E.) is perhaps the most popular of the
historians of Rome. He devoted a large portion of his life to his
Ab Urbe Condita (From the City's Founding) and left 142 books on the
topic. Thirty Five survive, as well as a review of the rest. Penguin
presents four volumes in English: The Early History of Rome (books 1
to 5), The War With Hannibal (books 21-30) both translated by Aubrey
de Salincourt; Rome and Italy (books 6-10) translated by Betty
Radice and Rome and the Mediterranean translated by Henry Bettenson.

Livy begins his history by underlining the strength of character of
the early Romans, the moral integrity that led the city to rise to
general domination. He expresses his preference for those early
virtues to the behaviour of the Romans of more recent times, when
the influx of wealth and striving for power resulted in severe
civil discord.

Livy records the myths of the foundation of the city and its early
generations. He describes the growth of Rome, its domination by the
Etruscans and the expulsion of the last Etruscan ruler. He portrays
quite dramatically the titanic struggle between Rome and Carthage's
outstanding general Hannibal. Hannibal won a number of victories
that were very costly in Roman lives. Rome was able to survive,
in part because of its high population. The personality of both
enemy commander and outstanding Roman generals is well conveyed.

Livy, in the Classical tradition, records speeches delivered to
troops about to engage in battle. Of course, no notes were taken
and he is composing what seems appropriate. Livy also describes
omens adding graphically to his account of the unfolding of the
battles he describes.

As Classical history in general, Livy's history focuses primarily on
political and military affairs, on internal and external politics,
very often resulting in violence. The great war with Hannibal, so
long and so destructive, he records as being initiated by Rome.
Afterwards Roman armies march ever further from home. Booty and
tribute flow into the capital and the vices attributable to such
emerge.

Livy offers an interesting mythic account of Rome's birth, the
city's rise to dominance in Italy, classes conflict. There are many
fascinating details, examples of heroism, fortitude, personal
integrity, etc. He writes in a gripping narrative style. His work is
very readable.
