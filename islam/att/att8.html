THE HISTORY OF AL-TABARI, v. XXVI "The Waning of the Umayyad
Caliphate," transl. Caole Hillenbrand, SUNY, Albany, 1989

Translator's Foreword" (pp. xiii-xviii): At Tabari focuses on
Syria, Kufah and Khurasan (with Transoxiana) for his account of
these highly significant years preceeding the Abbasid Revolution.
His sources are largely al Mada'ini, Abu Mikhnaf and some documents
(including al-Walid's persuasive and problematic succession letter)
Acknowledgements are rendered.

A.H. 121 (18/12/738-6/12/739): Maslamah raided Byzantines. Marwan
ibn Muhammad raided and obtained tribute from the Sarir (Avars).
Zayd ibn Ali ibn Husayn ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib was involved in
litigation. Hisham favoured him until he was informed of Zayd's
suggestion of Zayd's ascendency. Kufans encouraged Zayd to revolt.
He was ordered to leave Kufah, but remained, abiding secretly and
receiving the allegiance of many.

Nasr ibn Sayyar exempted all Muslims from the poll tax and imposed
the land tax on all. He fought Turks, capturing and executing old
Kursul. He fought al Harith ibn Surayj. He attacked Samarqand. He
secured peace with Farghanah. Muhammad ibn Hisham led the
pilgrimage.

A.H. 122 (7/12/739-25/11/740): Yusuf ibn Umar learned of Zayd's
plot, ordered Kufans to assemble in the great mosque, locked them
in and hunted Zayd in the houses. Zayd with some troops fought to
the mosque and called for those inside to join him. He forced the
Syrians back to a swamp, but there was killed by an arrow. Zayd's
head was sent to Hisham, nailed to the Damascus Gate and then sent
to Medina. Muhammad ibn Hisham led the pilgrimage.

A.H. 123 (26/11/740-14/11/741): Nasr ibn Sayyar allowed dispersed
Soghdians to return peacefully. Those jealous of Nasr maligned him.
Maghra urged by Yusuf to do this replied, "With what can I reproach
him? Should I find fault with his experience, his obedience, his
good fortune in affairs, or his skillful government?" Yusuf said
with his old age and this was done effectively, for Hisham removed
Nasr from office. Yazid ibn Hisham led the pilgrimage.

A.H. 124 (15/11/741-3/11/742): Abbasids arrived in Kufah on their
way to Mecca. Sulayman ibn Hisham raided Byzantines. Muhammad ibn
Hisham led the pilgrimage.

A.H. 125 (4/11/742-24/10/743): Hisham died on February 6, 743. He
died of diphtheria. He was a simple person keeping the same green
cloak he'd owned before becoming caliph and adding nothing. He, as
all Marwanids, drew no military stipend save actually on campaign.
He was scrupulous in care of state finances. He could milk a goat
and make bread. He lived in the healthier desert, building two
castles at the old Byzantine site of ar Rusafah. Al Walid ibn Yazid
ibn Abd al Malik became caliph on February 6, 743.

Al Walid was known for drinking and versifying. Hisham had cut off
his allowance and sent away his closest drinking buddy. As heir al
Walid was open handed; as caliph he was munificent, caring for the
cripled and blind and increasing the stipend. He named his two 
sons, al Hakam and Uthman his heirs.

Al Walid first confirmed Nasr ibn Sayyar as governor, then after
Yusuf ibn Umar spoke to al Walid, dismissed Nasr. Al Walid named
his maternal uncle Yusuf ibn Muhammad Medina's governor. Muslims
raided Byzantines. Zayd's son Yahya was killed in Khurasan.

A.H. 126 (25/10/743-12/10/744): Al Walid imprisoned Sulayman ibn
Hisham. Yazid ibn al Walid spoke against al Walid's immorality. 
Plotters prepared to assassinate the caliph. Khalid refused to
join them and cautioned al Walid; the caliph imprisoned Khalid.
Yusuf obtained Khalid, tortured and killed him. Al Walid's own
relatives strongly opposed him on such grounds, as well as the
caliph's immorality.

Yazid led a force into Damascus. Al Walid went to al Bakhra 25
km south of Palmyra. There he was captured, beheaded and the
head was paraded through Damascus. He died on April 15, 744.

At Tabari (p. 243) quotes a couplet of al Walid's. I find Sir
John Glubb's translation more appealing (The Empire of the 
Arabs p. 200)

"I am the son of Chosroes, my ancestor was Merwan,
Caesar was my grandsire and my grandsire was Khaqan."

On news of al Walid's death there were uprisings in Hims, in
Palestine, in Jordan. Yazid named Mansur ibn Jumhur governor
of Iraq. Yusuf ibn Umar was imprisoned and later killed by the
son of Khalid. Mansur tried to depose Khurasan's Nasr ibn
Sayyar, but Nasr refused to accept this. Opposed by Juday ibn
Ali, also known as al Kirmani, Nasr invited al Harith to come
back from his Turkish exile.   

Yazid named his brother Ibrahim to succeed with Abd al Aziz to
follow Ibrahim. Marwan ibn Muhammad first opposed Yazid, then
rendered him homage. Yazid fell ill and passed away on the 3rd
or 4th of October in 744. Yazid was tall and handsome. He was
known as the Inadequate, because he restored the stipend to 
the previous amount. Al Waqidi says Abd al Aziz ibn Umar led
the pilgrimage, some others say Umar ibn Abdallah. 

A.H. 127 (13/10/744-2/10/745): Ibrahim succeeded not. Marwan 
became caliph. He defeated Sulayman. There were disturbances 
in Iraq. Al Harith arrived in Marv and received support.

A.H. 127 Cont. Al Hakam allegedly recited verses before his
death naming Marwan caliph. Marwan was hailed as caliph by 
people in Hims. He appointed governors of Hims, Damascus, 
Palestine and Jordan. He provided assurance of safety to
Ibrahim. 

Marwan put down uprisings in Hims and other places. He 
named his sons Ubaydallah and Abdallah heirs. Kharitite
al Dahhak rebelled, defeated Syrian troops and captured
Kufah. Sulayman ibn Hisham rebelled. Marwan won a great
victory over Sulayman's forces. Marwan took Hims after a
bitter ten month siege. Kharijites advanced on Mosul and
were defeated. Abd al Aziz ibn Umar ibn Abd al Aziz led
the pilgrimage. 

A.H. 128 (3/10/745-21/9/746): In Khurasan Nasr tried to 
gain the support of al Harith. When al Harith refused he
was defeated. He went to al Kirmani and joined him. This
cost al Kirmani some of his own supporters. Then he died
fighting against al Kirmani.

Abbasids continued to promote their cause. Al Dahak took
Mosul, beseiged Nisibis and fell fighting Marwan's cavalry
at Kafartutha. Khaybari now headed this Kharijite 
insurgency. He threw back Marwan's centre, seized the
caliph's camp and even sat on Marwan's carpet. He and 
those with him were killed in fighting in the camp.
Kharijites elected Shayban to lead them. Abd al Aziz ibn
Umar led the pilgrimage.

A.H. 129 (22/9/746-10/9/747): Shayban and Sulayman ibn
Hisham went to Mosul. Marwan pursued them and beseiged
them there for six months. Marwan's forces won in Iraq 
and reinforced him at Mosul. Shayban and Sulayman fled.
Shayban was killed on Bahrayn, Sulayman sailed for Sind.

Imam Ibrahim called for the proclamation in Khurasan of
the Abbasid Revolution. This was done at Ramadan (16/5 
to 14/6/747) Nasr sent his retainer Yazid with a force
against the Abbasids. They defeated and captured Yazid.
Their spirituality impressed him. Abbasid Khazim ibn 
Khuzaymahat Tamimi defeated and killed Nasr's governor
in Marwarrudh. 

Many opposed the Abbasid Abu Muslim. He went to Alin
village. Al Kirmani and Nasr fought. Al Kirmani fell. 
Abu Hamzah led Kharijites in pilgrimage. Abd al Walid
ibn Sulayman led the pilgrimage.

A.H. 130 (11/9/747-30/8/748): Abu Muslim entered Marv 
on February 14, 748 or January 26, 748. Abu Muslim 
killed Shayban and al Kirmani's sons. The governor of
Jurjan was killed. Abu Hamzah entered Madinah on the
29th of October, 747. Marwan's forces advanced. Abu
Hamzah attacked them. He lost was and was killed. Al
Walid ibn Hisham raided Byzantines. Muhammad ibn Abd 
al Malik led the pilgrimage.  

A.H. 131 (31/8/748-19/8/749): Nasr fell sick and died 
at Rayy on november 7, 748. He was 85. His people went
to Hamadhan. Qahtabah came to Rayy and sent his son on
to Hamadhan. He fought ibn Dubarah, took Isbahan and
beseiged Nihaward for several months. Syrians made 
terms and left. Qahtabah's underling Abu Awn defeated
and killed Uthman ibn Sufyan at Shahrazur. Al Walid
ibn Urwah led the pilgrimage.

A.H. 132 (20/8/749-8/8/750): Qahtabah leading an 
Abbasid force towards Kufah was killed. His son Hasan 
succeeded him. Muhammad ibn Khalid rebelled. He was
joined by fellow tribesmen. Salm ibn Qutaybah repelled 
an attack on Basra. He left on news of the death of ibn
Hubayrah. Abu al Abbas was acclaimed caliph in Rabi I
(October 18-November 16, 749. He appointed Sufyan 
Basra's governor.

There are many traditions concerning coming Abbasid
ascendency. Imam Ibrahim died, some say murdered, some
say of disease in prison. Many supported his successor
Abu al Abbas. Marwan, defeated at the Zab, fled all the
way to Egypt where he was killed on August 6, 750. A
number of uprisings against the Abbasids were overcome.

A.H. 133 (9/8/750-29/7/751): Dawud ibn Ali killed all
Umayyad family members captured in Medina and Mecca. He
then died after only three months as governor. Abu al
Abbas appointed Ziyad ibn Ubaydallah his successor. The

Transoxiana. He was killed. Sulayman ibn Ali led the 
pilgrimage.

A.H. 136 (7/7/753-26/6/754): Abu Muslim came from 
Khurasan to visit Abu al Abbas. The caliph's brother Abu
Ja'far wanted to kill Abu Muslim; the caliph dissuaded
him. Abu Ja'far and Abu Muslim made the pilgrimage. Abu
