Epona

Astride a horse, beneath the moon,
The wind your wondrous crown,
Vital, alive,
Epona,
Your shining smile
Illumines hearts, stirs souls.
Your shield flings off the falling hail,
Preserves, protects, secures,
The feeble, weak.
Epona,
You shade us all,
Giver to those in need,
A balm, a feast, a guarding keep.
For your boundless bounty,
We are grateful,
Epona.

Oghma

O aged ancient shielding sage!
O lofty lord of lore!
O patron wise!
Oghma!
Sheltering home,
A port in fiercest storm,
Ancestral, all-instructing harp,
With enticing, teaching tunes,
Connecting hearts,
Oghma.
O mead of minds!
In darkest night a sun,
O dawn, O spring, O gracious guide!
O trove of seeking souls!
Our warmest thanks,
Oghma.
