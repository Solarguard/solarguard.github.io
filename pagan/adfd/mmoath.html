Dedicants Oath

This was taken in front of the grove here at our equinox ritual in
September 2000. This is the journal entry:

   (omit first paragraph unconnected to ritual)
   Today we had the harvest ritual at the Tree Ring followed by a
pot luck here. There were 15 adults and 4 children at the Rit. One
surprise was that our Senior Druid called me and Puck to the front
and said that we were to be recognized as having sent our materials
for the dedicants oath and asked if we would swear to abide by the
will of Lugh, Mannanan and the Daghda. I replied that I swear by the
gods our people swear by. Then he handed me the newly offered
drinking horn (this was at the part the horn was to be passed
around). I held it to the other dedicant, Puck, who then held it for
me.
