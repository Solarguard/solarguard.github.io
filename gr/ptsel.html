On the Careers of Ptolemy and Seleucas After the Death of Alexander

A brief consideration of the contrasts and similarities of the
careers of Seleucus Nicator and Ptolemy Soter following the death of
Alexander the Great imposes the need for selection of material.

The legacy of that most successful conqueror proved insufficient to
provide his successors with peace and stability. The degree of
instability indeed offered tremendous opportunity for the display of
keen military and political acumen, aspects of human activity
granting much material to ancient historians who were greatly
preoccupied with these things.

Thus, the shifting alliances of Alexander's officers and the
frequent passage of Macedonian armies across his conquered lands and
under the command of the various successors are recorded too well to
allow a detailed reference and analysis of any brevity.

Moreover, the careful study of the intrigues and hostilities, the
shrewdness and daring, the tumultuous and complicated twists of
Fortune, which allowed these two generals to exceed Alexander in the
successful founding of great kingdoms and long lasting dynasties, is
not sufficiently absorbing to contain the entire attention of some
modern scholars. At least an equal interest seems to be aroused by
those factors and designs which influenced the character of those
kingdoms and the even wider contributions by some of their residents
to the culture and civilization of their age and of ours.

At the outset one could comment on the comparative degree of
boldness and of prudence manifested in the lives of these men during
this time. One could notice the fact that the relative security of
the holdings each possessed near the beginning of this period seemed
to reinforce his tendency to practise his particular virtue.

Ptolemy, declining to reside overlong in the centre of the single
empire having two kings and two regents, was granted instead, at his
request, the overlordship of the territory of Egypt,(1) which on the
quick death of Cleomenes intended to serve as a check on his power,
he proceeded to rule unrestrained.(2) While he did venture far from
the acquired safety of Egypt and even in 309 presided at Corinth
over a congress of "freed" Greeks from the Peloponnese,(3) he is
perhaps better known for his reliance on the security granted his
core possessions by such geographical features as the swift Nile and
the stormy Mediterranean.

When Perdiccas in 321 attempted to assert his dominance over the
ruler of Egypt, Ptolemy and his army were content to observe from
the west bank of the mighty river the frustrated regent commending
his valiant troops to the raging waters (Diodorus Siculus xviii.35
records but rejects the theory that Ptolemy saw to their greater
intensity by opening a canal upstream) and to the voracious
appetites of the resident crocodiles.(4)

On the consequent demise of Perdiccas, murdered by the disgruntled
survivors, Ptolemy refused to assume the care of the young kings and
of the Great Empire, contenting himself with his kingdom and the
naming of new regents.(5)

When fifteen years later the aging Antigonus followed up his son's
devastating triumph over the Ptolemaic fleet at Cyprus by leading a
very large army across the Sinai to the Nile, Ptolemy, prudent as
ever, allowed the contest to be resolved by means other than the
clash of arms. The depletion of Antigonus' supplies, the bribery of
his troops and the inability of his son's storm battered fleet to
assist in a crossing of the Nile sufficed to remove him and his
forces.(6)

A few years later (301) Ptolemy advanced towards the decisive Battle
of Ipsus. However, it turned out he was satisfied to stay south of
the Eleutherus granting the other divine rulers, including Seleucus,
their chance at the glory of victory.(7)

Seleucus, who had stayed as satrap in Babylon, while Ptolemy rushed
over to rule Egypt, found himself more exposed to the designs of the
other commanders. True, he used the flooding of an unused canal to
neutralize the threat of Eumenes in 317.(8) However, on receipt of
an imperious command preceeding the approaching army of Antigonus in
316, he realized the insufficiency of his resources, human and
geographic, and felt compelled to visit Egypt.(9)

Yet, four years later with a relatively small force ("no more than
eight hundred foot soldiers and about two hundred horse"(10)) he
boldly strove to oppose Antigonus and regain Babylon. Seleucus,
having occupied himself for some years with matters beyond the
recorded interest of the surviving sources, re-enters history,
possessing all the Macedonian holdings east of Babylon, with the
exception of those he traded to the Indian Chandragupta for the
elephants which at Ipsus would win him Syria north of the
Eleutherus.(11)

It is likely that he had occasion to display even more military
prowess and daring than is historically preserved. However, it is
also noteworthy that he judged a Mediterranean coastline of greater
worth than the Indian conquests of Alexander.

While international diplomacy consumed some of the time of
Alexander's successors, perhaps even more than the details of even
the political marriages was the foresight and ability of both Soter
and Nicator to present a clearly designated and sufficiently mature
successor. Seleucus had done this a dozen years before(12) his long
life was cut short by a surplus Ptolemy.(13) Ptolemy Philadelphus
was raised to co-rulership in 285, two years before his father's
death.(14)

Numerous fascinating questions about the influence of the lands and
peoples coming under the sway of these two kings, as well as of the
personal character, imagination and energy of the rulers and their
advisers could be posed in attempting to assess the nature of the
great kingdoms which now appeared.

It could be said that whatever the outlying possessions of the
Ptolemies from Cyrene and Phoenicia to the Aegean, there remained
the solitary monolithic centre of Egypt. Soter would face relative
ease continuing an ongoing pharaonic domination of the Egyptians.

On the other hand, the Seleucid control of the major portion of the
old Achaemenid Empire could be viewed as the ruling of an amalgam of
a number of semi-autonomous tribes, cities, peoples and temple
states.

That keen political balance, the golden mean between the extremes of
overcentralization and fragmentation, that harmony of the spheres of
local, national and regional responsibility exercises even today the
utmost ingenuity of our leaders and theoreticians. Regardless of
conflicting present preferences, a facile assessment of the
weaknesses of the diversity and decentralization of the state
Seleucus established and of its Achaemenid predecessor would be an
oversimplification.

It is recently argued (no doubt at least in part in response to
previously strongly held concepts) that the Seleucids, as the
Ptolemies, ruled a domain with a significant bureaucracy
necessitating extensive correspondence.(15)

One of Nicator's policies seems to have been the fostering of strong
local communities, both old and new. An interest in material other
than the Greek sources has led to the examination of surviving
cuneiform tablets which appear to depict a strong support by
Seleucus I for the culture and priestly caste of his original
satrapy.(16) Greek, it is argued, was by no means the sole official
language of the Seleucid Kingdom.(17)

His establishment of Seleucia-on-the-Tigris (one of a number of
centres of peripatetic royal authority, as was that of the
Achaemenids before him(18)) and the partial and temporary settlement
of Babylonians within it is not seen as a calculated move against
the ancient city, which it is said lay two days distant on a
different river and greater trade route.(19)

There still remains the fascinations of the newly founded Greek
colonies and the radiance of Hellenic culture and civilization
across Seleucus' vast Asian territory. Whatever the original
conceptions (the provision of land for Greek soldiers, Greek
soldiers for the land, trading posts and commercial centres, etc.)
Asia becomes endowed with thriving Greek poleis, gymnasia and all.

Nicator founded many cities (nine of which he named after himself)
in Syria, Mesopotamia, Parthia, Scythia and India, to name some of
the regions mentioned in Appian.(20) He founded Beroea (Aleppo)(21),
Seleucia-ad-Tigrim(22) and Duro-Europus.(23) However, by far the
greatest of Seleucus' foundations was Antioch-ad-Orontem. The
careful planning of the city, with its streets deliberately laid
out so as to most benefit from the breeze, and the commissioning by
the first Seleucid not simply of builders but of famous sculptors to
create statues such as Eutichides' Tyche of Antioch and Bryaxis'
Apollo at Daphne (Antioch's water favored suburb) epitomize the
expansion of Hellenism in the East.(24)

Ptolemy as well established Greek speaking settlements (which one
recent author poetically declares "dotted the landscape" from the
Mediterranean to the First Cataract(25)). His major foundation
(Ptolemais, of course) was not far from Thebes, traditional centre
of Upper Egypt.(26) Yet, the dazzling legacy of Ptolemy Soter
remains his expansion in all its many facets of
Alexandria-near-Egypt.

As a port, whose double harbour was the object of improvement plans
from early in his reign,(27) whose lighthouse (completed in Ptolemy
II's time but initiated by his father)(28) with its incredible
height and pulleyed lift,(29) was one of the seven wonders of the
world,(30)) the city became a focal point of Mediterranean trade and
commerce.

The efflorescence of Ptolemaic designs, realized in the construction
of buildings, harbours, lighthouse and even the tomb of the Great
Alexander,(31) in the physical manifestation of the new
Hellenic-Egyptian cult of Serapis,(32) achieved its brightest lustre
in the establishment at Alexandria of resident intellectuals and
institutions of knowledge.

Soter, who himself in Alexandria composed a history of the campaigns
of Alexandria, became a great patron of his age. There lived then
the historians Hecataeus of Abdera and Manetho(34) (whose surviving
list of pharaohs forms a foundation of Egyptology(35)) and the
elemental mathematician Euclid.(36) Theophrastus, the successor of
Aristotle, was invited to Alexandria,(37) although it was his
brilliant pupil, Demetrius of Phalerum, who sought Ptolemaic
hospitality soon after ceasing to rule Athens in 307.(38)

It is suggested that Demetrius and others (such as the first Royal
Tutor, Philitas of Cos) assisted Soter's intent to establish
Alexandria as a cultural centre.(39) In time the duties of at least
some Royal Tutors seem to have come to include the headship of a
Library, the most famous in antiquity.(40) In addition Ptolemy
perhaps influenced by the religious and philosophical concepts of
Demetrius and the Peripatetics established a centre for the worship
of the Muses, which would inspire literary and scholarly activity
for centuries.

Soter's bequeathing to Egypt of these institutions (the practise of
invitation and support of intellectuals, the Mouseion and the
Library of Alexandria) and of successors brought up to appreciate
and foster these foundations.(42) was a lasting monument eclipsing
the deeds of Seleucus.
