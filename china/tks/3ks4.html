Brewitt-Taylor, Charles E. Tuttle, Tokyo, 1994 (1959, 1925)

Ch XCI pp. 322-332 Told seven times seven human heads are usually
sacrificed to appease the river spirits, Chuko Liang utters a
peaceful prayer and provides forty nine flour heads filled with ox
and goat meat. The army triumphantly proceeds northward. Ts'ao P'ei
dies aged forty. Fifteen year old Ts'ao Jui succeeds. Brilliant
general Ssuma I is presented falsely as plotting rebellion and
forced to retire. Chuko memorializes the emperor concerning the
invasion of Wei, comments on the disturbance of the stars and leads
forth the army, Chao Yun and Teng Chih leading the van. Ts'ai Jui
names Hsiahou Mou to oppose.

Ch XCII pp. 333-341 Aged Chao Yun valiantly bests five Ch'ing
captains and puts Hsiahou Mou to flight. Next day Chao fights long
and hard, drawn into ambush, attacked on all sides, little repose
available before moonrise. Chuko sends reinforcements. They arrive
having slain Hsueh Tse and Tung Hsi. Hsiahou Mou routed flees to
Nananchun. Ten days of seige fail. Chuko lures rescuers out from
Anting and takes that city. The prefect of Anting tries a ruse
against Chuko at Nananchun. It fails. Nananchun falls. Hsiahou Mou
is captured. Chiang Wei tells Ma Tsun, prefect of T'ienshui, a ruse
to capture Chuko Liang.

Ch XCIII pp. 342-353 Chiang frustrates Chao Yun's attack on

yields to Chuko Liang who speaks of at last imparting knowledge to
one worthy. T'ienshui yields. Hsiahou and Ma Tsun flee to the
Ch'iang. Many other places yield. Ts'ao Chen leads an imposing army.
Aged Wang Lang addresses Chuko about the Mandate of Heaven. Chuko
replies. The rebel collapses dead. In confused night fighting
Ts'ao's forces are soundly defeated.

Ch XCIV pp. 354-364 Ts'ao calls on the Ch'iang who send a vast army.
Their iron chariots rout the Shu. Kuan Hsing flees before the
formidable Yuehchi. Kuan Yu's spirit rescues his son and nephew
Chang Pao. Chuko Liang lures the Ch'iang into pits covered by snow.
Many are captured. Kuan Hsing slays Yuechi. Chuko Liang kindly
releases all prisoners and speaks of friendship between Shu and the
Ch'iang. Ts'ao Chen pursues the seemingly disorderly Shu army. He is
surprised and defeated. He seeks reinforcements. Ts'ao Jui commands
Ssuma I lead an army. Ssuma I learns of Meng Ta's intended
defection, marches at once, surprises Meng Ta who is slain.

Ch XCV pp. 365-375 Ssuma I plans to cut Shu's supply line. Ma Sa
rejecting advise is easily defeated. Many commanders and forces
clash. Shu retires. Ssuma I rushes with a large force to the storage
depot of Hsich'eng. Chuko Liang plays his lute with the gates open.

and Chang Pao's forces. The Wei soldiers flee. Ts'ao Chen's troops
are ambushed. The Shu army pulls back. Chao Yun guards the rear.
Ts'ao Jui hears words of conquests.

Ch XCVI pp. 376-385 Sun Tzu advises Ts'ao Jui to hold strong
defences, allow Wu and Shu to weaken themselves, so the Central Land
will prevail. Chuko Liang, upholding the supremecy of law, executes
Ma Su and requests he himself be degraded. Chuko is degraded and
assigned the same duties. Chou Feng lures Wei to send forces. Sun
Ch'uan appoints Lu Hsun to handle the Wei armies. Chia K'uei urges
Ts'ao Hsiu be cautious. Chou Feng cuts his hair as sign of his
fidelity. Chia K'uei is not convinced. Ts'ao is. Chou leads Ts'ao
into hazardous terrain. Chia K'uei rescues Ts'ao when Lu Hsun scores
a victory. Lu Hsun urges Shu be invited to attack Wei. Sun Ch'uan
sends the message.

Ch XCVII pp. 386-395 Chao Yun dies. Chuko suggests accepting Wei's
offer and leads an army forth. Ch'ents'ang blocks the advance.
Persuasion fails. Ladders draw fire arrows. Battering rams are

warrior Wang Shuang rushes forward to relieve the city. Wang fells
Shu champions and disperses Shu's soldiers. Chiang Wei's lying
letter lures a Wei force to defeat and Fei Yao to his death. Ts'ao
Jui calls on Ssuma I.

ruse. Chuko Liang responds with a succession of victorious Shu
troops. Wei Yen lures, ambushes and kills awesome Wang Shuang. Sun
Ch'uan assumes imperial rank. Chuko Chin's son K'o is precocious.
Hao Chao dying, Chuko Liang seizes Ch'ients'ang. San Pass falls to
Shu. Ssuma I advances from the capital.

Ch XCIX pp. 406-416 Ssuma I sends a force to come at Chuko from the
rear. Chuko ambushes this force. Chang Pao falls in a gully and is
badly hurt. Ssuma, calculating Chuko is busy in two captured cities,
sends forces to attack the Shu army from behind. He readies a full
frontal assault. Chuko ambushes and defeats the troops sent behind
his army. Ssuma I refuses to fight. Chuko falls back in stages
luring the enemy out. Detailed maneuvers, including a demoralizing
strike at Ssuma I's camp, give Shu a great victory. News comes of
Chang Pao's death. Chuko collapses. The Shu army withdraws. Ts'ao
Chen, well again, leads a force with Ssuma I towards Shu. Rains

Ssuma defection scheme. The real Ch'in Lang and many Wei soldiers

comments on Chuko's health imperilling routine. Chuko, learning of
Wei's successes over Wu, collapses. Chuko Liang reads the sky, prays
and places his fate's candle amongst others. Ssuma sees Chuko's
illness in the stars and sends troops to investigate. A soldier
rushing into Chuko's tent to report Wei's moves extinguishes Chuko's
fate's candle.

Ch CIV pp 462-469 Chuko Liang makes preparations, urges the
continuation of loyal officers, states that he has added nothing to
his property and passes away aged fifty two. Tu Fu, Po Chu-i and
Yuan Wei-chih wrote cited poems on him. The Shu army withdraws.
Ssuma advances. A wooden replica of Chuko puts him to flight.

Ch CV pp. 470-480 Wei Yen's rebellion is abruptly cut short, when

feigns to desert to Chiang Wei to oppose Ssuma. Chiang pretends to
believe him, thus luring Teng Ai into an ambush. Slipping from his

Chiang Wei back after him. Chiang triumphs.

Chiang Wei arrives and fierce fightin rages. Teng Ai then keeps on

goes to relieve Ch'ishan. Chiang Wei follows Teng. Chiang is doing
well when profligate King Ch'an recalls him. Chiang Wei realizes his
peril from the influential eunuch Huang Hao and requests Miaochung
whence he can control West Shensi. Teng Ai faces him. Wei's Chung
Hui pretends to attack Wu, intends to take Shu.

Ch CXVI pp. 571-579 Wei's impressive army moves. Teng Ai's dream is
not wholly satisfying. Dissipated King Ch'an consults a mollifying
wisewoman, rather than respond energetically to Chiang Wei's urgent
warnings. Lu Hsun initially holds Nancheng Pass, then it falls.
Chiang Shu surrenders Yangp'ing Pass. Chung Hui notices supernatural
manifestations, sacrifices at Chuko Liang's tomb and orders his army
to treat the Shu population well during the invasion. Chiang Wei
drives back Wang Ch'i and Ch'ien Hung. As he clashes indecisively

submit, Prince Shen dies. Chiang Wei is ordered to surrender. He
becomes friendly with Chung Hui. Teng Ai recommends steps to conquer
Wu. His letters alarm the capital. Ssuma Chao leads an army from
Wei.

and cruel. He sends Lu K'ang to take Hsiangyang. Chin sends Yang Hu
to defend. Yang's men grow much food. The two generals become close.
Sun Hao sends Sun Chi to replace Lu. Yang Hu retires old and sick.
He names Tu Yu as worthy to conquer Wu. Sun Hao continues to oppress

placed. Tu Yu triumphs on land. Wang Chun's rafts of straw men in
armour frighten away Wu soldiers. Great torches soaked in linseed
oil break the chains. Chin ships sail. Hao yields and is taken to
Loyang. Empires wax and wane; states cleave asunder and coalesce.
