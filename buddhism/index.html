<h1>Buddhism</h1>

Welcome to Solarguard's new Buddhism section. This great world religion is perhaps the most renouned for its contributions to human peace and understanding.  It may take time to flesh this section out, and it is hoped eventually that this will have a significant number of highly interesting articles and reviews. Initially, here's a summary of the well known Chinese novel Journey to the West which is based on the 7th Century journey of Xuanzang to India seeking the Buddhist texts and of Sally Hovey Wriggins' The Silk Road Journey with Xuanzang, a look at the historical pilgrim. This section was last updated on November 14, 2006 C.E. with the addition of a review of a basic Buddhist text book.<p>
