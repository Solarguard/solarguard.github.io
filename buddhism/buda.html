Foreward by Betty Heimann: This book is highly recommended for its
telling simplicity.

"Introduction" (pp. 1-5): Northern Inidia in the Sixth Century B.C.
was divided into a number of states, had an advanced civilization,
had four major castes and various schools of religious thought.

"The Life of the Buddha" (pp. 6-52): Prince Siddhartha Gotama had a
happy childhood, married a beautiful girl, but finally saw the sick,
the old and a corpse. He renounced the world. In time he chose the
Middle Path between extremes of asceticism and pleasure. He achieved
enlightenment sitting under a bo tree.

He taught for forty five years, impressing many, sending out
disciples, converting his father's envoys, his father, his wife and
many others.

"Some Important Events and Personalities" (pp. 53-98): Among the
charming stories of these pages is that of Anathapindika, feeder of
the destitute who from a prince demanding a very high price bought a
garden and built a monastery. Buddha convinced two kings about to
begin battle to resolve their dispute peacefully. He said women also
could renounce the world.

Mice disclosed the falsity of an accusation against Buddha. Punna
went to a fierce country and converted many. Buddha abode a while in
a forest to escape monastic dissention. Monks repented. Humble Rahula
became an arhant.

Buddha delayed a sermon so a late farmer could hear it. Ananda was
very close to Buddha. Buddha converted the brigand Angulimala. This
taming of so wild a person impressed king Pasenadi. Angulimala also
helped relieve the pain of one in childbirth. Buddha granted peace to
the parricide Ajatasattu. At Pataliputta he convened the First
Buddhist Council.

Buddha consoled the grieving Patacara. He asked the mourning Kisa
Gotami to obtain mustard seed from a home where none had died.

Devadatta's hired killers were converted by Buddha, a rock tossed by
Devadatta failed, a wild elephant Devadatta released became calm in
Buddha's presence.

Buddha visied sick monks and attended those passing away.

"The Passing Away of the Buddha" (pp. 99-108): Buddha consoled those
sad at his own imminent death.

"The Daily Life of the Buddha" (pp. 109-111): A three page outline of
his daily routine, meditating, alms seeking, sermon giving, etc.

"The Buddha's Contribution to the World" (pp. 112-116): Buddha
proclaimed latent human potential, founded hospitals, asserted the
high place of women, condemned slavery and denounced the caste
system.

"The Buddha's Visits to Ceylon" (pp. 117-139): His first visit drove
away yakkhas, impressed devas and gave some of his hair to Ceylon.
His second visit resolved discord and averted war. His third visit
was hospitably received. He left his footprint.

The First Council resulted in the Tripitaka (monastic rules,
discourses and profound philosophy). the Second Council rejected ten
lax rules. The Third Council reaffirmed spirituality.

"Asoka and His Missions" (pp. 128-139): Savage fighting established
this great Third Century B.C. warrior on his imperial throne.
Remorseful he embraced Buddhism. He established hospitals, appointed
charity commisioners, abolished the caste system and sent out
Buddhist envoys, including to Egypt, Syria, Greece and Ceylon, this
last a mission bearing significant fruit.

The Four Noble Truths are sorrow, its cause, its cessation and the
path to its cessation. This eightfold path is right understanding,
right thought, right speech, right action, right livlihood, right
endeavour, right minfulness and right concentration.

Kamma places humans' varied lot in life in their own hands, the
consequence of actions in previous lives. Present good kamma will
beneficially influence the future. Desire causes rebirth. Overcoming
craving releases one from rebirth.

Nibbana is a realization, a cessation of craving, an end of rebirth.

   Nibbana the Summum Bonum of Buddhists is deliverance from all
   limitations, fetters and bondage that binds one to Sansara. It is
   the cleansing of the mind of all defilements which mars its
   purity. According to the Buddha many are the obstacles that lay in
   the path that leads one from the worldly to this state of
   supramundane consciousness (Arahantship), but among them there are
   in particular, five, of which constant mention is made in the
   Suttas. p. 166

These five hindrances are: sensual desire, ill will, sloth, mental
agitation and doubt.

Some suttas (Parabhava, Mangala, Metta) are quoted.
