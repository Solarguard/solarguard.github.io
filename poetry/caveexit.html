EXIT CAVES

In dark caves beasts fight.
In field's green sun's light.
Peace, farms, town life when?
Cease wombs' rage. Come "Men."

Michael McKenny November 2005 C.E.

This initial attempt to write a poem in a traditional Chinese manner
takes as its theme an early Chinese thought that barbarians live in
caves, joins this to the concept that as long as humans divide
themselves into contending groups (classes, political factions,
tribes, races, religions, countries, blocks of countries, etc.) they
are not yet a sentient species and urges the birth of humanity.
