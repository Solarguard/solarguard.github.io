<center>A GUIDE TO OGAM</center><p>

Damian McManus, An Sagart, Maynooth, 1991

<p>The author has presented a detailed consideration of the state of the
study of this fascinating subject. He introduces the alphabet and its
twenty original characters stating that the supplementary forfeda, "Were
designed with the Latin and Greek alphabets in mind." (p. 2) He quotes
the description in the AURAICEPT NA NECES indicating, 

<blockquote>That although the
alphabet is almost invariably written horizontally (from left to right)
in the manuscripts this account would appear to describe a vertically
disposed Ogam. (p. 3)</blockquote> 

<p>He mentions that whereas usually the source of a
borrowed alphabet is clearly evident, such is not the case with ogam.
"The signary, for example, is not an evolved or derived form of any
known alphabetic script." (p. 5)

<p>He challenges disparaging assessments of ogam. He outlines some
theories as to its origin, referring to: manual gestures, runes, tally
sticks, cryptic and telegraphic aspects of this consideration. One
telling point is, 

<blockquote>In its most dignified role as a monument script,
moreover, Ogam can scarcely be described as cryptic since this would
defeat the purpose of the inscription and the accompanying Latin on the
British stones would make nonsense of any such contention. (p. 15)</blockquote>

<p>One
interesting assertion is, "Tallies have been employed almost universally
since paleolithic times." (p. 11)
     
<p>He challenges the current common concept of the meanings of a number
of the letter names. For example, he sees ruis as, "Red," tinne as
"Strong," muin as, "Neck," nin as, "Fork," etc. (pp. 36-38). He refers
the reader to previous work he has done on the letter names. There is
some interesting material in this third chapter on various ideas on the
origin of the ogam. Perhaps the most humourous of these is, 

<blockquote>Meyer
(1917), for example, has Ogam as the creation of a Celtic trio whose
names happened to contain identical vowel sequences and were chosen to
dictate the consonant arrangement; he identifies them, predictably, as
Balovuseni, Hadotuceqi and Magonguzeri!. (p. 26)</blockquote>

<p>There was also
Richardson who in 1943 posited the origin of the word ogam in the Greek
letter agma, "The alphabet being named after the peculiarity that it
alone had a distinctive symbol for the sound." (p. 29)

<p>He mentions some of the problems with letters that represent sounds
that may have shifted in the language, as those represented by Q and H.
On page 36 he suggests that H may have been consonantal Y. He mentions
that the characters Huath, Ngetal and Straiph, "Are not reliably
attested at all," in the inscriptions. (p. 33) He advises, "The reader
unfamiliar with the nature of the Irish manuscript tradition," that,

<blockquote>The texts will usually have been subjected to varying degrees of
revision, modernization and corruption and it is one of the editor's
tasks to undo the changes brought about during a considerable period of
transmission in order to establish the 'original' text. (p. 32)</blockquote>
     
<p>Chapter Four introduces the inscriptions. While these, "Have been
found in most counties of Ireland, in Wales, Devon, Cornwall and the
Isle of Man" (p. 44), they are concentrated largely, "In the southern
counties of Kerry, Cork and Waterford." (p. 45) 

<blockquote>The condition of the
inscriptions ranges along a scale from perfect preservation to virtual
complete illegibility and a high percentage of them is defective in one
way or another, a fact which makes the Ogam record a notoriously
difficult one to work with. (p. 47)</blockquote>

<p>The author expresses doubt as to
the identification of any of the individuals named on the stones with
those known elsewhere, with the exception of a, "King of Dyfed, who died
in the middle of the sixth century." (p. 52) He mentions crosses on some
of the Ogam stones. He considers the debate as to the religion of the
Ogamists, concluding, 

<blockquote>The witch-hunt for MUCOI formulae, the
disinfecting of perfidious inscriptions with Christian symbolism and the
general aversion to Ogam as an embodiment of a pagan past all make
colourful, not to say sensational, reading but are probably as divorced
from reality as is the impression to which the give rise, that of
Christianity and its literary vehicle, the Latin alphabet, supplanting a
pagan writing system. (p. 60)</blockquote>

<p>He provides deductions from the
inscriptions, often Ogam and Latin, on stones in Britain, for example,
that they confirm the presence of Irish colonists there and the
inclination of such colonists to conformity with the ways of the land.
     
<p>Chapter Five considers the dating of the inscriptions. Right off the
bat he writes: 

<blockquote>For the Irish inscriptions we do not have a single
secure anchor point at an archaeological, palaeographical, historical or
linguistic level. Absolute dating is beyond our reach as the identity of
the people commemorated on the inscriptions is unknown. (p. 78)</blockquote>

<p>He considers several means of attempting to estimate dates, including
formulae and the presence of crosses. 

<blockquote>As inscriptions are contemporary
documents and have not suffered at the hands of a modernizing scribal
tradition, as have our manuscript sources..., the latest spelling on any
given stone may be considered decisive as to the relative date of
writing, and late spellings of formula words are particularly
significant as these show most resistence to change. (p. 83)</blockquote>

<p>He then considers various periods of Irish linguistic history and
various developments and changes of the language. He concludes, 

<blockquote>Owing
to the fragmentary nature of many inscriptions it is impossible to give
exact figures but the bulk appear to belong to the Late Primitive Irish
period with a substantial but decreasing proportion in Archaic Irish and
a very small number in Early Old Irish. (p. 96)</blockquote>

<p>Latin palaeography has
provided a, "Mid-fifth to mid-sixth century," (p. 97) dating for most
Latin inscriptions accompanying ogams in Britain.
   
<p>Chapter Six takes a look at Irish names. "The Ogam inscriptions also
constitute our earliest corpus of personal and tribal names." (p. 101)
He considers the names in three broad categories and subdivides these.
This allows him to make such observations as, "In initial position
divine names are relatively common," (p. 103) for the category of,
"Compounded dithematic names." (p. 101) The chapter includes comments on
orthography during a period of, "Enormous changes taking place in the
language." (p. 127) He looks at, "Tribal and sept or kindred names" (p.
110) and remarks, 

<blockquote>Some of the above stones are found in areas
corresponding more or less to the location of the relevant tribe or sept
in later records. (p. 111)</blockquote>

<p>With Chapter Seven he begins a consideration of scholastic ogams.  He
mentions the die dated to the second century by Raftery which may have
five represented by, "The third character of the Ogham alphabet (viz. V)
with its Roman numerical value." (p. 129) He examines several scholastic
ogams on stones up to the 19th Century. And he looks at other uses,
including manuscripts. 

<blockquote>The main body of manuscript Ogams is to be found
in three Irish texts which deal in part or exclusively with Ogam, viz.
AURAICEPT NA NECES 'The Scholars' Primer', DE DUILIB FEDA NA FORFID, a
short tract dealing with the values of the supplementary characters, and
IN LEBOR OGAIM 'The Book of Ogam' or 'The Ogam Tract.' (p. 137)</blockquote>

<p>This last has a lot of variant alphabets that, "Have all the appearance of
being the creations of idle schoolboys." (p. 138) He considers some of
these. He proceeds to an examination of the forfeda in the three
sources.

<p>Chapter Eight looks at medieval theories and at ogam in Irish
literature. It mentions the myth of Fenius Farsaid. It reminds the
reader that the myth agrees with modern scholarship on the point, "That
Ogam was a once-off creation, not the result of an evolution over a
period of time." (p. 149) He proceeds to the alternate myth of Ogma mac
Elathan and the reference in "The Book of Ogam" to the letter names
coming from trees. He mentions Lucian's account of Ogmios. Here McManus
is cautious. 

<blockquote>Unfortunately we know too little about both Ogma mac
Elathan and Ogmios to allow for certainty of identification but it is
difficult to keep them apart, though there are some linguistic problems
in the equation and in the relation of both names to the word ogam. (p.
152)</blockquote>

<p>As to the sagas, 

<blockquote>The most frequently occurring single type of reference to
Ogam is one which ties in nicely with what IS KNOWN to have been its
principal use, i.e. as a vehicle for memorial inscriptions. (p. 154)</blockquote>

<p>He then mentions other uses of ogam in the sagas, such as Cu Chulainn's
delay of the army, the druid Dallan's location of Etain and Bran's
recording of his adventures. As to an association of ogam to magic, he
writes, 

<blockquote>the superstitious belief in the magical powers of writing is a
universal phenomenon and is particularly prevalent in societies in which
literacy is the prerogative of the few. (p. 163)</blockquote>

<p>He turns to the legal aspect, "To Ogam inscriptions on stone as
evidence of title to land." (p. 163) 

<blockquote>One must asume that in such a case
the occupier's or claimant's right was confirmed by his demonstrating
that the name recorded on the stone was that of one of his kinsmen or
ancestors. (pp. 164-165)</blockquote>

<p>The book contains two appendices, kennings on the letter names (pp. 42-43) and 
comments on additions to Macalister's CORPUS of inscriptions. (pp. 65-77)
    
<p>This is an interesting book on a fascinating topic. For a manual of
divination, I still resonate most in tune with Edred Thorsson's 
<a href="thebookofogham.html">THE 
BOOK OF OGHAM</a>. However, for a glimpse at the natural range of diverse human
opinions when the scholarly mind is confronted with, "The intractable
nature of so many features of the subject" (p. xi), and a good exposure
to the details of ogams on monuments and in manuscripts this is well
worth the read.<p>
