	<title>Divination</title>
</head>

<body>

Divination, learning from hidden sources, has since the dawn of history been a 
very serious human concern. The earliest examples of Chinese writing are records
of Shang dynasty divination.<p>

Michael McKenny has had a special interest in this subject for some thirty
years. He is currently a member of the ADF Seers' Guild. It is hoped that
as this web page grows it will reflect the extent of his studies and be of some
benefit to all who are also looking into this very fascinating aspect of human
endeavour. At present the site contains Michael McKenny's initial considerations of Irish Ogham, of the Elder Futhark (runes), his article on Enochian chess, Enochian correspondences and his reviews of more than a dozen divinatory books. Below one may access subdirectories on Chinese divination, on runes and on ogham, as well as info on Ifa (Yoruba), a description from Eirik's Saga of a seeress in Greenland, links to Tarot Canada and some valuable links within the solarguard subdirectories. This was last updated on August 22, 2004 C.E. with the addition of ogham verses for kids. <p>
