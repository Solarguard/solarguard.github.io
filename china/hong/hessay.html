The Scale of Hong Lou Meng.

Hong Lou Meng is an awesome work, whose full scope is not easily
conveyed to a casual reader. This is a grand family saga taking
place largely within the women's quarters of a great noble house.
The scale is so vast at many levels that an attempt to describe it
is apt to fall significantly short.

It is not so much a uniqueness in either the long intricate plot or
the number of characters. Many modern TV series extending over
several seasons may offer a similar range on both counts. It may be
more the amazing spectrum of the living cultural heritage of the
youths playing such prominent roles that is so striking, yet so
largely passed over.

It is hard to miss when teenagers decide to form a poetry club and
the story not only mentions that the club met, but provides the
poems the members compose as part of the text. However, there are so
many literary citations and allusions that a comprehensive inventory
of these would be quite challenging.

This is a highly literate work, both in the widespread presence of
books and the written word (calligraphy exercises, apt names and
phrases placed on banners, poems penned on gift handkerchiefs,
greeting letters exchanged by people living within walking distance,
etc.) and the variety of subject matter of such books (for example,
classical philosophy, poetry, history, romance, religion, mystical
works and manuals for musical instrument and for the game go).

Other arts portrayed in the novel include painting, music, drama,
architecture and landscape design. These may be on an extraordinary
scale. For example, the family devotes considerable attention to
landscaping a Garden worthy of the visit (even if only for a day) of
an imperial concubine. These grounds at the mansion, with the
various buildings erected in this Garden, form the setting,
residences and outdoors, for the youthful family members and their
maids for a significant period of the story. The family not simply
enjoys plays on festive occasions, but buys its own troupe of young
players and lodges these girls full time in the Garden.

A modern reader can find the wealth of traditional life displayed
throughout these pages so panoramic that many details are
overlooked. An overall impression of splendour, of declining
fortunes, of personal ideosynchrocies, personal affections and
personality clashes, of carriages, lanterns and matchmakers may
cause some not to notice almanacs and the matching of horoscopes, or
a hundred and more other interesting ways of what was ordinary life
for these characters.

In the fullness of time perhaps this site will contain some sort of
annotated remarks on some of the treasury of traditional culture and
life as presented in the course of this magnificent tale. Perhaps
some of the comments others have made on the detected
autobiographical (i.e. factual) nature of the story may also be
included. For now, what can be restated is that beyond the tapestry
of the novel's events, its splendid characterization, its
multilayered meaning (mundane and mystical), its descriptive power,
towers the array of a background dazzling in its immensity.

If the above has not very effectively communicated the expanse
extending in front of one entering Hong Lou Meng, such a superb
harvest of inspiration, this little essay's opening sentence has
simply been confirmed.
