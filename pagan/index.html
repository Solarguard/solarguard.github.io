<h1>Pagan</h1>

<p>Welcome<p>

This section was last updated on October 17, 2008 with an updating of the Red Maple Grove index page. A Major focus here, as on this solarguard site in general, is on some of the serious scholarship forming a foundation for pagan reconstructionism. Michael McKenny is a Celtic reconstructionist who joined <a href="http://www.imbas.org/">Imbas</a> at Samhain 1997 C.E. and <a href="http://www.adf.org/">ADF</a> at Imbolc 1999. As I see it, the aim of pagan reconstructionism is to seek to honour our ancestors by living  as ideally they would be living were they now alive. There are now separate Celtic and Germanic sections, material that had been here having been moved to form them. A number of other sections, such as Africa, China, Japan, etc. also provide very interesting consideration of pagan themes.<p>

At present this site offers three subdirectories, one on divination, one a subsidiary Red Maple Grove page, and one on files connected with the ADF Dedicants' program. In addition, directly below are some eight book reviews or synopses (not including the twelve divination ones in that subsection), notes of four Spiritual Traditions sessions and an essay on the Emperor Julian as defender of Hellenism (including paganism).<p>

May what is here be interesting to whomever may read it.<p>
