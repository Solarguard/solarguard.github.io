The Turkic peoples emerged from an early heroic background with the impressive virtues of such a society: individual self reliance, sagacious leadership, memorable courage, rich oral linguistic facility, etc. At present, this site offers Michael McKenny's reviews of four books and one chapter of the Cambridge History of Ancient China. It is likely that the next file placed here will be a review of Bernard Lewis's THE EMERGENCE OF MODERN TURKEY. This section was last updated on August 4, 2006 C.E.<p>
