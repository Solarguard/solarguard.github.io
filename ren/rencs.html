Power and Imagination, City-States in Renaissance Italy, Lauro Marines,
Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1979

1 "The Ascent of Communes" (7-21): Eleventh and early Twelfth Century
Italy was chaotic. German emperors asserting authority in North Italy
confronted: powerful vassals and cities, religious reformists, papal
factions and Roman barons and Byzantines and Normans exerting pressure
from the south. Trade, agricultural production and population steadily
increased. Cities grew. Greater authority weakened; the local official
(church and secular) often exercised real power.

2 "The Early Commune and its Nobility" (22-33): Cities clashed,
asserted autonomy, evolved politically. Ideally co-operative, the
commune was intensely competitive. Old and new families contended for
wealth and office.

3 "The Commune Around 1200" (34-44): Powerful clans lived in connected
properties, imposing towers. Guilds flourished and multiplied. One
executive officer, the podesta, arose over an elaborate administration.

4 "Popolo and Popular Commune" (45-61): The privileged resisted demands
for inclusion. Lines were crossed. Some non-noble people backed the
powerful. Popular leaders came from upper classes. Organization and
discipline led to popular armed success.

5 "The End of the Popular Commune" (62-71): Landed and commercial
wealth prevailed, enabling powerful oligarchic, even one man, rule.
Popular ascendency had opened new vistas, continued increased public
construction, even fostered the growth of vernacular literature. Here
popular generally refers to guildsmen and excludes the poorest
classess. Simplistic theories of excessively violent popular communes
naturally evolving into despotisms do not bear scrutiny.

6 "The Course of Urban Values" (72-93): Urban dwellers were aware of
their better place than rural residents. Crowded cities made privacy
rare. Home and shop overlapped. Poets decried the supremecy of money
and the uncouth new rich. Cities were religious, heretics and devout
preachers a part of the spiritual landscape.

7 "Despotism: Signories" (94-110): In crises, a high office holder
could acquire despotic power. Retained this could become hereditary.
Despots were nobles natural allies; often a faction of exiled noblemen
seized property from people previously prominent. Despots had advisers,
an administration and a mercenary army; an unarmed citizenry better
ensured despotic control. Personality, perception and moderation also
favoured continuing reign.

8 "The Course of Political Feeling" (111-129): Local identity was
strong. Early Renaissance writers perceived politics from a religious
viewpoint. Brunetto Latini exemplifies the Classical revival,
influenced by Cicero for rhetoric's importance in public affairs.
Latini also considered practical procedures for acquiring power and
ensuring effective administration. He urged adherence to law and
harmony. Aristotle also influenced Renaissance political theory.

9 "Oligarchy: Renaissance Republics" (130-161): Under stress, communes
accepted rule by one man, an hereditary family or a select citizenry.
Florence, Lucca, Siena and Venice were the principal republics. Genoa,
Bologna, and Perugia alternated republican and despotic regimes. In 
ports economic opportunities mitigated popular agitation. The five
inland republics controlled adjacent, even more distant, territory,
reducing land based nobility's authority.

In 1447, despotic Milan became republican. This period (1447-1450) was
marked by: Venetian invasion, concern over renewed despotism, financial
stress augmented by upper class reluctance to pay, or even lend, money
to the state. Generally, republics were run by a number of short term
councils. Eligibility was strictly controlled. Efforts were made to
overcome electoral fraud. A small number of prominent families
consistently held office. Out of office notables participated as
advisers.

10 "Economic Trends and Attitudes" (162-190): In early times large land
holdings splintered, cultivation intensified, rural renters and share
croppers became more numerous and rural to urban migration bolstered
cities. Peasants helped man fleets. Many maids came from the country.
Urbanites invested in the country, had houses there and looked down on
country folk.

Later rural land again fell into fewer hands. Disease and war caused
urban and rural population decline. Trade decreased. Venetians put more
into their expanded Italian lands than trade. They also loaned money,
spent to obtain public office and in conspicuous consumption.

City revenue increased. Communes acquired imperial and other tax and
other fee collection rights. The rich loaned cities money at interest.
Expenses (including for high cost mercenaries and maintaining despots
in style) increased more. Tax avoidance, two sets of books, fabrication
of religious donations, etc. are documented. The privileged felt they
deserved privilege. Systematically indebted craftsmen often sought
better pay, abandoning city and debt. Poorer folk were considered the
responsibility of religious charity.

11 "Humanism: A Program For Ruling Classes" (191-217): Humanists
presented an aristocratic education: Latin grammar, Greek, Classical
poets, rhetoric, history, ethics. Humanism emerged among lawyers and
notaries by 1400 representing rather than a vanguard more the growing
outlook of a worldly literati and governing class. Many famous
humanists ("avidly ambitious, socially mobile, proud, touchy, and
combatative" p. 206) were adept at praising leadership employing such
foreign praisers.

The Fifteenth Century saw the rise of scientific objectivity, of
textual and historical criticism, of new fields, including
archaeology. Humanism flourished most in the decades before the
destabilizing French invasion of 1494.

12 "The Princely Courts" (218-240): Princes provided patronage. Their
power, wealth. palatial residences focused attention, service,
flattery, apprehension. Writers and painters praised them, their pets
and favourites. Sculpture and architecture asserted their power. Their
collections of art, books, curiousities evidenced princely wealth, as
did pageants and hunts.

13 "Art: An Alliance With Power" (241-276): Great families patronized
buildings and the art that went into them. Fourteenth Century artists
were of craftsmen class. Fifteenth Century artists, especially those at
court, could do well. Some travelled diffusing styles. Renaissance art
became increasingly true to nature. Perspective improved. Art and
architecture reflected a more assertive elite consciousness.

14 "Invasion: City-States in Lightning and Twilight" (277-296): The
French invasion of 1494 unleashed some sixty years of complex foreign
involved struggles in Italy. This chapter provides a political and
military summary.

15 "The High Renaissance: A Divided Consciousness" (297-331): Invaded
Italy provided contrasts of luxury and poverty, spirituality and papal
worldliness, law and brute force, ideal and real. Machiavelli pondered
the relationship of will (ambition) and Fortune. Guicciardini noted
contrasting aristocrating policies and the views of the powerless
masses. Divided Italy reached for a unifying language, yearned for an
ideal political reality.

16 "The End of the Renaissance" (332-337): There followed the Catholic
Reformation, increased fanaticism with many Renaissance books on the
Index of forbidden reading. Foreigners continued to dominate divided
Italy. There was trade and wealth and continuing economic disparity.
