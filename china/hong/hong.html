HONG LOU MENG, THE STORY OF THE STONE, Cao Xueqin, transl. David
Hawkes, Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1976 (1973)

Here follows a plot synopsis of the first of the five volumes of the
Penguin translation, THE STORY OF THE STONE (the Golden Days). This
summary has been sketched to assist my memory. Anyone else stumbling
upon this is reminded that a menu is a poor substitute for a meal
and strongly encouraged to take the time to enjoy one of Earth's
greatest works of literature. 

Ch. 1 (pp. 47-66): A stone unused for sky-repair received Cao
Xuechin's tale remembering a dozen Nanking girls. Zhen Shih-yin
dreamt a Taoist and Buddhist took this stone for human birth amongst
these girls, including tear-debt owing Crimson Pearl Flower. Zhen
woke and refused a Taoist and Buddhist his little girl. Jia Yu-cun,
a poor student, caught sight of one of Zhen's maids. With Zhen's
financial help, Jia hastens to the exams. Grieving their lost
daughter, the Zhen's leave their burnt home for Mrs. Zhen's father,
Feng Su. Feng takes much of Zhen's money. Zhen sickens, but recovers
and goes off with a wandering Taoist. Mrs. Zhen's maid watches the
new magistrate going by.

Ch. 2 (pp. 67-83): This magistrate, Jia Yu-cun, marries the maid.
Jia dismissed wanders, becomes tutor to Dai-yu, and one day hears
gossip of the Jias of Jinling. A friend tells him they are in
decline with degenerate sons, though the youngest, Bao-yu, was born
with an inscribed jade in his mouth. Bao-yu has always thought
highly of girls.

Ch. 3 (pp. 84-107): Dai-yu's deceased mother's kin (of this same Jia
House) bring the girl to their home. Yu-cun accompanies her, makes a
favourable impression and is appointed a magistrate. Dai-yu, very
impressed by the servants, mansions and relatives, especially her
grandmother, impresses all. Dai-yu has always been sickly, but she
is graceful and refined. She meets her cousin, Bao-yu, a handsome
lad given to histrionics. Because of his grandmother's deep
affection for him, he resides with her and his female cousins.

Ch. 4 (pp. 108-123): News comes from Yu-cun. He's run into a case
involving one of the four richest provincial families. Xue Pan has
killed a man over a slave girl. She turns out to be Zhen's missing
daughter. Yu-cun bends the law, satisfying both the rich and the
victim's compensated relatives. Oafish Xue Pan, his mother and
sister visit their relatives, the Jias. The Jias prevail upon them
to remain, providing them Pear Tree Court. Xue Pan gets along very
well with his dissipated cousins.

Ch. 5 (pp. 124-148): Xue Bao-chai, the sister, is more beautiful and
friendly to the maids than Dai-yu. Dai-yu and Bao-yu become great
companions. Bao-yu dreams of the fairy Disenchantment showing him
the registers of the beauties of Jinling, presenting him to her
fairy maidens, granting him a performance of "A Dream of Golden
Days" with its poetical, romantic references and introducing him to
the passionate fairy Ke Qing.

Ch. 6 (pp. 149-166): Awakening Bao-yu makes love to his maid Aroma.
Granny Liu, a distant connection of Bao-yu's mother, calls with her
little grandson. She first sees an old maidservant who explains that

the household.

Ch. 7 (pp. 167-184): The old maidservant speaks with Xue Bao-chai
who describes an intricate recipe for a remedy for a mysterious
ailment. Mrs. Xue gives twelve beautiful artificial flowers for
girls of the household. Dai-yu is piqued that she gets last choice.
Xi-feng is invited to visit the other branch of the family in the
neighbouring mansion. Bao-yu accompanies her and meets his nephew's

Qin Zhong to attend the Jia private school. An old drunk servant
causes a ruckus and has to be restrained.

Ch. 8 (pp. 185-201): Bao-yu visits Bao-chai, shows her his jade with

skull to cure him. He looks at the mirror's forbidden other side,
views her enticing form, over-exerts himself and dies. After Jia
Rui's funeral, Dai-yu sets out to visit her sick father.
