Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Current, Sheila Ostrander and Lynn
Schroeder, Prentice Hall, Eaglewood Cliffs, N.J., 1970

This is a fascinating look at Soviet scientific research into psychic
topics during the 60s. The authors attended an international conference
in Moscow in June 1968, where they encountered serious investigation
into a variety of paranormal topics. Telepathic experiments conducted
between Leningrad and Moscow appeared to confirm that people who know
each other can contact each other over great distances, at however
rudimentary a level. Distinction is made between one's capacity as a
telepathic sender and as a telepathic receiver.

Experiments looked at telepathy in animals, at human telekinesis, at
dowsing for water and for valuable mineral deposits and at hypnosis. In
this last, the book asserts that unremarkable individuals were prone to
hypnotic suggestion that they were reincarnations of famous Renaissance
artists and produce paintings appropriate for the Renaissance figures.

Other topics include the aura, kirlian photography, UFOs and military
potential of psychic abilities. While there is the suggestion that some
form of telepathy may not only facilitate communication between humans
in space, the book's very title underlines human segmentation and the
challenges facing those inhabiting Earth to attain species sentience.

This is a noteworthy look at an aspect of Soviet life during a partial
thaw in the Cold War and just before a cooling of relations between
East and West. Only a few months after the international conference
launching this Western treatment of psychic investigations on the other
side of the Iron Curtain the Prague Spring ended. The authors suggest
that the chill also affected open academic interest in the paranormal.

All in all a highly interesting book.
