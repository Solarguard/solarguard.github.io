Chapter 2: The Formative Period (1910 - 1949)

At the opening of this period, Canada had completed nearly seventy 
years of research in archaeology. Sixty-eight years had elapsed since 
Logan's appointment as director of the Geological Survey, fifty-one 
years since Dawson's work on the famous site, and thirty-seven years 
since Gilpin's introduction of the Three-Age system.

The year 1910 saw the appointment of Edward Sapir, a student of Franz 
Boas, as director of the Anthropology Division of the Museum of the 
Geological Survey in Ottawa. His appointment came as a result of the 
legislation of 1907, which allowed the formation of an Anthropology 
Division. Sapir, though very unhappy in his position because of 
administrative interference to his projects, remained at his post 
until 1925. He published only one paper in the Museum's series 
(Darnell, 1976).

The year folowing his appointment, Sapir chose Harlan Smith as 
archaeologist. The connection between these two individuals is 
obvious, and their common training under Boas influenced the sort of 
archaeology that was done by the Anthropology Division for the next 
forty years.

That year (1911), David Boyle died and was succeeded by Orr. 
Wintemberg left Toronto and moved to Ottawa. He attached himself to 
the newly created Victoria Memorial Museum on McLeod Street, as 
part-time field worker, under Harlan Smith. Smith published his first 
Canadian article, a statement of the methods of archaeology, entitled 
"Archaeological Evidence as Determined by Method and Selection" 
(Smith, 1911f).

It emphasized the need for serious training in the methods of 
archaeology, to avoid the compiling of misleading information. Single 
finds must be considered unique until they are found to be 
duplicated, a principle which went against much of the antiquarians' 
extrapolating. Recognition of materials found is more complete when 
the individual is properly trained, which in turn allows for a 
greater variety of materials. It stated that excavation was 
preferable to surface collection, because of the better proportion of 
stone and bone artifacts. It warned that amateur collections were 
usually skewed towards the unusual, but that the object of the 
archaeologist was to determine the common; unique pieces are usually 
seen in relation to common pieces, and not in themselves. However, it 
stated that the context (grave, house-site, etc.) may indicate some 
specialized use of an object, either of function, individual or group 
(shaman, fisher village, etc.). Finally, it stated that the goal of 
archaeology must be the reconstruction of prehistoric ethnology.

Harry Piers was working in Nova Scotia at the time, but little 
notable work was being done anywhere.

But the following years saw the initiation of four major projects, 
three of which were under the direct supervision of Harlan Smith. In 
1912, Wintemberg, now full-time preparator, began the Roebuck site 
project. It was the largest archaeological undertaking in Canada. It 
involved the systematic excavation of an eight acre site containing 
85 burials, and thousands of potsherds and artifacts. The site had 
been discovered in 1845 and visited by Guest in 1854, but no work had 
been done in any organized fashion (Wintemberg, 1936: 1-2). It was 
worked during two seasons, in 1912 and 1915. The report was not 
published until 1936.

The same year, W.B. Nickerson began his three year survey and 
excavation project of the Manitoba mounds. Nickerson, an amateur 
archaeologist and and employee of the Chicago and Great Western 
Railway, had done much work for the Peabody Museum on the Illinois 
mounds between 1895 and 1901. It must be noted that Smith was 
Assistant Curator of the American Museum of Natural History at that 
time, and must have had some contact with Nickerson, though no 
mention is made of this anywhere.

Nickerson is a unique individual in the history of archaeology, much 
like Thomas Jefferson. He anticipated modern methods of controlled 
excavation that included datum plane, 5-foot grid system, digging by 
levels, careful smoothing of profiles and floors, and detailed 
recording (Capes, 1963: 2). He remained in obscurity however, until 
1926, when, shortly after his death, the University of Chicago 
discovered his unpublished reports and placed them in the Field 
Museum. In 1942, Bennett (1942) wrote of him that few men living in 
that year had been able to better Nickerson in technique and 
interpretation of data. It was not until 1963 that some of his notes 
were compiled by Katherine Capes.

But the world was not widely interested in such matters. The romance 
of Atlantis had captured the imagination of many, and to such a point 
that it prompted Orr to write:

   ...in time, some Archaeological genius may devise means of         
   descending into the depths of the deepest ocean, and presenting to 
   a wondering world the history of the buried cities of the past. Or 
   maybe some convulsion of nature, such as has occurred in the past, 
   may disentomb those cities which it submerged thousands and        
   thousands of years ago.

   But our duty at present is to travel along the beaten paths and    
   build up therefrom the history of the ancient races on this        
   continent. From Patagonia to the Yukon their footprints are to be  
   found; from the ruins of the stately palaces of the Incas and      
   Toltec, to the common village Long House of the Huron and          
   Iroquois, we have but to gather the handiwork of their artisans    
   and sculptors, the paintings of their artists, and the ornaments   
   and weapons of their nomadic tribes. Time and research will do the 
   rest. (Orr, in ARCI, 1911: 9)

It is difficult to tell whether Orr was serious, which is to be 
assumed as this was a difficult year for him with the passing of 
Boyle, or if he was being facetious when he gave some credit to the 
existence of the Atlantean cities. Notwithstanding, he thought that 
the present duties lay elsewhere, closer to hand. But his description 
of the work to be done has definite overtones of antiquarianism.

In 1913, the second group of large projects was initiated, the 
Mertgomish Harbour project by Smith and Wintemberg, who excavated the 
Eisenhauer Shell-heap, and the first multidisciplinary study 
undertaken in Canada, the Stefansson-Anderson Arctic Expedition. This 
expedition lasted for five years, until 1918, and employed Diamond 
Jenness as ethnologist-archaeologist. Its subject was the Copper 
Eskimo region.

Jenness, a native of New Zealand, who had conducted an 
anthropological expedition to New Guinea for Oxford University in 
1911, was hired by Sapir, presumably, to take part in the expedition. 
Many scientists were involved in this expedition and reports cover 
such varied subjects as mammal biology, ornithology, entomology, 
botany, marine botany, ischyology, geology, geography, ethnology and 
archaeology.

In New Brunswick, McIntosh published his volume on Iroquois pottery 
from Grand Lake, the first of his aforementioned projects.

It was also the year that saw the first National Museum Bulletins, 
published in a separate series from those of the Geological Survey. 
Smith also published a popularized version of his work on the West 
Coast with the Jesup North Pacific Expedition, as part of his project 
to widely disseminate information (Smith, 1913b).

In 1914, Smith and Wintemberg completed the Merigomish Harbour 
project. The following year, Wintemberg surveyed six counties in New 
Brunswick and completed the Roebuck site excavations. Nickerson 
reported for the last time on the Manitoba mounds and returned to 
Chicago. Frank Speck initiated the first major archaeological project 
in Quebec since the Dawson site when he discovered the Tadoussac 
site. The site was one of major importance, reinvestigated by 
Wintemberg in 1927 and Lowther in the early 1960's (Noble, 1973: 61).

Little occurred until 1920, when Jenness, Wintemberg and Strong all 
worked in Newfoundland-Labrador. Jenness was involved with the 
Beothucks, Wintemberg was conducting one of his many surveys and 
Strong was excavating in northern Labrador with some results.

In 1925, Wintemberg was named Assistant Archaeologist and conducted 
the second survey of Prince Edward Island, as well as a survey of 
Saskatchewan and Alberta. Jenness received a collection from Baffin 
Island, more specifically from Cape Dorset, which he compared with 
Matthiassen's collection from the Rasmussen 5th Thule Expedition 
(1921-1924) which had recently terminated (Dekin, 1973: 19).

In 1927, the same year that the National Museum received its name and 
status by an Order-in-Council (Appendix D), Wintemberg and Jenness 
travelled to Newfoundland. In that same year, and in 1929, they 
discovered sites of what came to be known as the Dorset culture. It 
was named by Wintemberg in 1929.

In 1927, Wintemberg also reinvestigated the Archaic site of 
Tadoussac, and Frederick Johnson picked up pottery at Lac Kakabonga, 
on the Upper Outaouais, while on an ethnological expedition. This 
material was incorporated into Wintemberg's posthumous report on 
aboriginal pottery (Wintemberg, 1942). This was the last work done in 
prehistoric archaeology in Quebec for twenty years.

By 1930, many men had gone through the National Museum. Sapir had 
left five years before, succeeded by Jenness, Francis Knowlse, later 
Sir Francis Knowles, had come and gone (1915-1921); he was appointed 
as physical anthropologist by Sapir but retired due to ill health and 
returned to England where he became curator of the Pitt-Rivers Museum 
at Oxford. However, he left behind a complete osteological analysis 
of the inhabitants of the Roebuck site, and made obvious the need for 
a competent physical anthropologist. Smith and Wintemberg remained at 
their posts.

in 1930, Wintemberg surveyed the east coast of New Brunswick, the 
Magdalen Islands and Eastern Ontario. Junius Bird, excavating in 
Labrador, identified the Hopedale culture. Charles Hill-Tout 
published a  description of the Great Fraser Midden in Vancouver.

In 1935, the Saskatchewan Archaeology Society was founded, the first 
such Society from the West.

Harlan Smith retired from his post as archaeologist in 1936. It seems 
that Jenness assimmilated his position. During his career, Smith had 
published well over a hundred articles, dealing with a great variety 
of subjects, from the construction of a cheap museum case, for local 
museums, to expositions of archaeological approach. Though he was 
rarely involved in field work after 1914, he proved to be a very 
competent administrator. He was interested in the role that a museum 
played in the education of the people, and was certainly instrumental 
in making the Victoria Memorial Museum what it is today. He spent 
much time in the development and organization of a central filing 
system for archaeology at the Museum, aprecursor of the National Site 
Register of the Archaeological Survey. He inaugerated weekly lectures 
to adults and schoolchildren which were kept up until this author was 
of age to be interested in the variety of subjects which were 
offered. Smith died in Ottawa on January 20th, 1940, at the age of 
68, having given the better part of his life to the development of 
archaeology in Canada.

The few years preceeding the war saw little work. Jury worked along 
Lake Erie, Nash at the Pound site, Greenman, for the University of 
Michigan, at the Old Birch Island site and the Palaeo-Indian site of 
George Lake near Killarney, and Kenneth Kidd at the Rock Lake site, 
in Algonquin Park. Except for these Ontario sites, only the 
reconnaissances of Wesley Bliss and Junius Bird in Alberta are worthy 
of mention.

The war years were not the best time for archaeology. The 
single-minded destructiveness of the nation, righteously directed at 
Germany, had little time for things of the past.

The Museum published no report from 1939 until 1947. Indeed, it was 
so absorbed by the war effort that its staff was disseminated among 
other departments. Jenness was appointed Deputy Director of 
Intelligence for the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1941 until the end 
of the war.

Wintemberg retired on January 1st, 1941, and died soon after, on 
April 25th. From 1937 until his retirement, he had been Associate 
Archaeologist and, since 1934, a Fellow of the Royal Society of 
Canada. Wintemberg, an indefatiguable researcher, left, as his 
legacy, many excavated sites, a number of surveys (he was the first 
man to systematically survey the country) and a considerable 
collection of notes on a thousand or more subjects in archaeology and 
ethnology, in all, over a hundred boxes.This author had occasion to 
refer to some of Wintemberg's notes in the course of his work and 
found them to be impressive, as were his field notes. Like Smith, 
Wintemberg also gave his life to archaeology, and his contributionis 
incalculable.

During the war years Bird and Stanton investigated parts of Manitoba, 
W.H. Rand opened the Rosser and Morden Mounds (1940), amateur Chris 
Vickers investigated the southeast region of Manitoba (1943), and 
William Orchard, as president of the Saskatchewan Archaeological 
Society, published his small volume "The Stone Age On the Prairies" 
(1942), a synthesis of Prairies archaeology. Strangely enough, this 
volume was published by the School Aids and Textbooks Company in 
Regina and Toronto. It was perhaps the first of its kind, since 
Smith's 1913 summary.

In 1946, archaeology crept back into the limelight and there was 
created an impetus which has carried through to this day. In British 
Columbia, Charles Borden was investigating the Fraser Delta, which 
greatly increased the knowledge of the West Coast peoples. Between 
1946 and 1948, McIlwraith began to train archaeology students, first 
at Cahiague and then at the nearby Soper site in Ontario. This had 
the effect of developing trained field personnel.

In 1947, Douglas Leechman and Frederica de Laguna surveyed the St. 
Lawrence Valley, between Cornwall and Cardinal, and excavated the 
Parker site. Norman Emerson excavated the Kant site on the Bonnechere 
River. Rogers and Rogers began their survey of the Mistassinni and 
Albanel Lakes in Quebec. But, most important, Richard MacNeish began 
his survey of Iroquois collections, which led him to introduce a 
technique of pottery type seriation, as well as the direct historical 
approach (MacNeish, 1952b).

Jenness retired, along with Marius Barbeau, a frequent contributor to 
ethnology, in 1948. He was succeeded by Douglas Leechman, who was, by 
then, Chief Archaeologist. Leechman, in turn, was succeeded by 
MacNeish.

That same year, Henry Collins extensively surveyed Frobisher and 
Resolute Bays, as well as Southampton, Coats, Walrus and Mansel 
Islands in the eastern Northwest Territories. This provided much 
information on the Thule and Dorset occupations of the Canadian 
Arctic (Dekin, 1973: 22).

In 1949, Boyd Wettlaufer excavated the Head-Smashed-In Buffalo jump 
in Alberta, MacNeish worked at Fondue Lake in Saskatchewan, Thomas 
Lee surveyed Southwestern Ontario, and William Ritchie, while 
studying Middle Woodlands in Central Ontario, surveyed portions of 
the Trent River system, between Picton and Rice Lake (Ritchie, 1949).

We now enter the third period of Canadian archaeology, that of 
maturity. It is almost a hundred years since Wilson's editorial, 
fully ninety since the Dawson site was discovered. The archaeological 
work of the National Museum has been going on for forty years. The 
spirit of Franz Boas was present throughout that period, as was the 
emphasis on extensive field work. Much was done, if one considers the 
few resources at hand. The parent institution's own emphasis on field 
work was certainly instrumental in choosing the Boasian approach, 
whether consciously or not.

But the hand of Government moved, and, with it, the National Museum. 
It was transferred from the Department of Mines, where the Geological 
Survey was housed, to the Department of Resources and Development, a 
newly created department which absorbed the functions of the 
Department of Mines. The Museum, somewhat independent since 1927, 
became completely independent.

During the period we have just reviewed, the important individuals 
were, without doubt, Edward Sapir, Harlan Smith, William Wintemberg 
and Diamond Jenness. W.B. Nickerson would certainly deserve a place 
here, were it notfor the fact that his contribution to the 
development of archaeology was not recognized.

In 1950, the four "enfants terribles" were no longer present and 
Canada was open to the introduction of new ideas from the South.

Chapter 3: Mature Archaeology (1950-1975)

This period was characterized by the introduction of ideas from 
American Archaeology, at least in its early stages, and the continued 
dependence of Canadian archaeology on this source of ideas.

The men of the formative period did not see their task as being 
generalizing or theorizing. They were dirt archaeologists and 
occasionally ethnologists. They collected, analyzed and published. 
But they were independent in the formulation of their results. It 
could not really be said that the Boasian approach was truly 
American. Most of Boas' field work was done in Canada, as was Harlan 
Smith's formative apprenticeship. Nickerson's methods were applied 
most extensively in Canada, under the direction of the Canadian 
government. But, even as all good things become stale, it was fated 
that extensive field work could not, by itself, produce the results 
required of it by Smith, the "reconstruction of prehistoric 
ethnology" (Smith, 1911f).

The stimulation offered by the new ideas, introduced by men like 
MacNeish, is evidenced in the number of publications that can be 
found from the 1950's and early 1960's, certainly a greater number 
than was published in the previous hundred years.

Although MacNeish had finished his survey of Iroquois pottery, it was 
not yet published in 1950. Valerie Burger, perhaps the first woman in 
Canadian archaeology, surveyed the Kempt and Manouwane Lakes region 
in southwestern Quebec. Rogers and Bradley expanded the work done 
three years before by Rogers and Rogers in central Quebec. Russell 
Harper excavated the Portland Point site, an Archaic site in New 
Brunswick, as well as two historic Micmac burials from Pictou, Nova 
Scotia.

The following year, the Ontario Archaeological Society was founded by 
Norman Emerson, and MacNeish began his three year survey of Southeast 
Manitoba. The report from this survey, published in 1958, was of 
major importance in explaining methods of selection in archaeology, 
the terminology of artifact description, and making explicit the 
establishment of typologies for lithic artifacts, as MacNeish's 
previous work had done with pottery types. Moreover he expressed the 
following ideas:

   Co-operation between the archaeologist or, better yet, a series of 
   archaeologists employed by a number of local institutions, amateur 
   archaeologists, and interested laymen could make for relatively    
   complete archaeological reconnaissances and thorough excavations.  
   It is hoped that during the further excavations and analysis of    
   the archaeological materials, the anthropologist can work in       
   co-operation with ethnologists, historians, geologists,            
   physicists, botanists, zoologists, agronomists, and a host of      
   other specialists. Such interdisciplinary co-operation can greatly 
   enhance studies of prehistory. If such a program can be carried    
   out, then we shall be able, eventually, to obtain a fairly         
   complete story of the prehistory of Manitoba. (MacNeish, 1958: 84)

The year 1952 saw the publication of MacNeish's pottery types, and it 
was also the year that a major development was introduced.

Charles Borden proposed a system for uniform site designation 
throughout Canada, now known as the Borden system (which 
unfortunately gave rise to the linguistic atrocities "to bordenize" 
and "bordinization"). The system is adapted from the Geological 
Survey map grid, divided every four degrees of longitude by two 
degrees of latitude. It permits the use of Geological Survey maps, 
with no modifications at 1: 250,000. The system is widely used 
throughout the country to designate prehistoric sites, though 
Manitoba uses its own system, as well as Ontario. This idea has not 
been adopted by the National Historic Sites.

It may be pertinent, at this point, to refer the reader to the 
chronoly of events, should he wish to locate a particular site. The 
number increases with every year and it would be most cumbersome to 
attempt to deal with them all here. Only those events of particular 
significance will be reviewed, followed by a summary of the 1950 - 
1975 period.

In 1955, the Glenbow Foundation in Alberta began its archaeological 
ventures, under the direction of Douglas Leechman. Leechman resigned 
his post with the Museum the following year.

In 1957, the Serpent Mounds excavations were begun, on Rice Lake, 
south of Peterborough. The University of Saskatchewan opened its 
Radiocarbon dating laboratory, a major aid in the establishment of 
absolute chronologies. William Taylor came into contact with the 
first skeleton of a Sadlermiut, on Southampton Island, Hudson's Bay.

In 1960, Richard Pearson began a two year survey, the third and last, 
of Prince Edward Island, locating eighteen sites along the southeast 
coast.

Work was resumed, in the early sixties, in Newfoundland, by MacLeod 
at Twillingate, Instad and Instad at the Norse site of 
l'Anse-aux-Meadows, and Elmer Harp and James Tuck in various locations.

In 1962, the Societe d'archeologie du Quebec was founded. The 
following year, one of the most important sites in North America was 
excavated by George MacDonald of the National Museum at Debert in 
Nova Scotia. The dates obtained for this Palaeo-Indian site have 
established the presence of Man in the Maratimes at 11,000 B.C.

In 1964, the first department of archaeology was formed at the 
University of Calgary. Its principal orientation is towards field 
work and it has produced some of the best trained archaeologists in 
Canada.

Soon after, Clyde Kennedy uncovered evidence of the existence of the 
Copper Complex on Morrison's Island in the Outaouais River, north of 
Ottawa. As the site was composed of burials in very bad decay, it 
might have represented an outpost.

In 1967, William Mayer-Oakes initiated the multidisciplinary Lake 
Agassiz project in Manitoba, some ten years after MacNeish had 
implanted the idea. That year also saw the Government's assent to new 
legislation, making the National Museum of Canada a Crown 
Corporation, to be known as the National Museums of Canada (Appendix 
E). Article 5 is of especial interest. It was also the year that 
William Taylor, Chief Archaeologist since MacNeish had resigned in 
1963 to take up his post at the Peabody Foundation, was promoted to 
Director of the newly created National Museum of Man, a position 
which he holds to this day. He was succeeded by James V. Wright who 
held the position until 1969, when he was in turn succeeded by George 
MacDonald, who is still the Chief of the Archaeological Survey.

In 1968, the Canadian Archaeological Association was founded and 
promises to grow to become an influential organization. In 1969, 
Roscoe Wilmeth published his synthesis of Canadian radiocarbon dates, 
a document which made available the dates from materials which had 
been analyzed in the United States, and which greatly simplified 
correlations. That year was also the last year for the publication of 
the National Museum Bulletins. They were replaced by occasional 
papers, and finally, in 1972, by the Mercury Series, a set of 
publications produced at minimum cost (typewritten) and aimed at the 
swift and inexpensive diffusion of reports.

We will now review the text of George MacDonald's address to the 
Royal Society of Canada (1976), and which is probably the best 
summary of recent prehistoric archaeology in Canada.

Great strides have been made in the development of archaeology in 
Canada, both financially and institutionally. Funding for research 
has greatly increased, and universities teaching archaeology have 
gone from two in 1950 to more than twenty. There has been a 
corresponding increase in the number of graduate students. It is no 
longer essential that someone wishing to pursue graduate studies in 
archaeology need go to the United States or Europe. Museums have 
greatly increased in number as well.

Legislation has been enacted in most provinces, concerning 
prehistoric as well as historic resources. There has been an increase 
in the federal and provincial governments' involvement with 
archaeology and a corresponding tenfold increase in professional 
archaeologists hired directly by governments. Governmental 
archaeological agencies are capable of administering prehistoric 
resources and undertaking field work with research staff.

The achievements of these many agencies has succeeded in pushing back 
the age of Man in North America to 30,000 years ago, when, ten years 
ago, barely the third of this age was considered extreme.

We have now seen the third, and last period of archaeology in Canada. 
This last period is the product of foreign "invasions", which have 
luckily advanced archaeology, here as well as in the United States. 
It can be said that Canadian archaeology is now in tune with the rest 
of the world. But there has been no sign of an innovator like Wilson 
or Smith. Perhaps the future holds a joyous surprise.

Chapter 4: The Future

As the future is uncertain, there is no point in speculating on the 
possible developments that archaeology might take. We should then 
look at the present needs and hope that the future, with some help, 
will provide.

MacDonald (1976) sees the need for the establishment of units with 
clearly defined functions of research, resource management and 
repository. Proper research into extensive comparative collections 
from the environment cannot, at present, be supported by any of the 
institutions involved in archaeology in Canada. Resource management 
cannot be dealt with properly, as it is an administrative problem, 
rather than a strictly archaeological one. The repository role is not 
satisfactory due to the large size of the collections and the 
difficult task of retrieving specific information.

Certain European countries, France, Germany and Switzerland, have 
dealt effectively with these problems. In France, archaeology is 
publically recognized as a scientific research field and the Centre 
National de Recherche Scientifique supports a complex of laboratories 
and research centers. Hundreds of archaeologists are on full or 
partial government salary. The annual budget of the CNRS is 
equivalent to tens of millions of Canadian dollars.

In Germany, although the budget is comparable to that of France, the 
administration is decentralized to the state level, with a staff each 
of more than one hundred.

Britain has appointed an Under-Secretary of State for archaeology.

None of these developments are to be found in Canada. At the present 
time, the economic situation may not permit these innovations, but, 
with some planning, a similar development could occur quite soon.

Conclusion

It is hoped that the reader will now have recognized the existence of 
the Canadian period in archaeology, and that this will not offend any 
ideas he may have had about it.

There is little more to say, save perhaps that the reader may find he 
is dissatisfied with this paper. I beg him to consider that many dates 
given here are probably inaccurate, by a year or so, and that little 
of the information could be cross-checked, because of the 
unavailability of certain material.

Notwithstanding these objections, I believe a separate chronology can 
be established for the development of archaeology in Canada, based on 
legislation rather than on the introduction of ideas. It must be 
remembered that, where government institutions are concerned, the 
climate of acceptance must agree with the law, not vice-versa.
