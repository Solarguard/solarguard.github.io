Chapter Twenty Distracted

It was several nights later. I was still visiting at Violet's
tower. I seemed to be stirring in my sleep. I was feeling content
and warm. All was very fine. I was dimly aware of the splendid
surroundings, of the great mountain and the brightly shining stars
outside. The scents of several hundred different kinds of herbs and
spices came wafting in the window, along with the calls of a great
variety of birds and insects.

I knew also that Violet was sleeping and dreaming close by. The
previous night we had decided to share a dream and this had been
quite an experience. Perhaps the same thing would happen tonight,
too. However, just as I began to dream about walking into her hedged
garden of health where I hoped to meet her, everything changed. At
once, the mountain and all the other surroundings were replaced by a
view of the orange sun low in the sky over the waves of a rising sea
adorned with the multicoloured billowing sails of dozens of ships.

It seemed I could feel the breeze upon my face and smell a maritime
aroma quite different from what I had known on Earth. It came into
my mind that what I was experiencing was the exquisite
environment of Yellow's birth isle. She was standing on the sandy
shore gazing to the southwest.

I felt her sensitive regret at disturbing all of us, and, especially
Violet and me.

"Sounds the Colours' Call," came her telepathic words, along with a
visual of a sailor standing on a ship with a conch to his lips. This
was followed by another visual, the image of a haggard and weary
face, almost an exhaused and defeated one. He looked so different, I
almost didn't recognized him. His psychic resonance identified him
as Orange. For a brief moment he just looked at me. Then, he
projected a single mental syllable, "Come!"

That brought me to instant consciousness. My eyes snapped open. I
could feel that Violet was awake, too.

Then, came Indigo's presence of mind. I could sense the oldest of
us, as she responded to that summons. In my mind's eye was a vivid
sight of Indigo sitting on a rock in a clearing in the forest. I
realized that she had not been asleep, but gazing at the stars in
the night sky, as one imbibing deeply from a chalice of mystic
mystery.

The interruption had seized her immediate attention. She then
analyzed and responded at once. "Let's worry later about the absence
of the tight pulse of informative background data. I suggest those
previously on Earth return there without delay. Bring Red and I up
to date as soon as you are able to do that."

"Agreed," assented Red.

"Going," projected Yellow.

"Be warm beneath Ay-yar's sheltering cloak," projected Indigo,

"Thrive," projected Violet, vanishing from her tower.

At once I made the necessary motions with my hand, while touching
my ring with the thumb of my left hand.

In less time than a single heartbeat, I was on my feet, garbed in
my verdant cloak and those feet were touching the ground of my birth
world. I noticed at once that my lover was standing beside me
attired in her violet cloak and that we had not been alone to come
so quickly. Yellow and Blue had also already arrived.

A bursting bubble of an image clung to the mind of blue. She had
been dreaming of a boat in the sea and the previous Wizard of Green
had been with her pointing at the stars. A tear came to the eye of
my heart. However, Blue noticed this and the bubble was gone.

We were standing in an old abandoned house, or perhaps one not so
long abandoned. Orange, looking pale and haggard, stood facing us.

"I know," he projected. "I ought to have contacted you sooner."

"What's going on?" asked Yellow.

"Well, they were so tiny, finger sized," projected Orange.

"Finger sized flutes, harps or bells?" asked Yellow. I could read
through the levity of her tone a very great concern.

"Pterodactyls," he projected in a telepathic whisper.

"Orange, have you been confronting pterodactyls alone?"

"But they were so small," he repeated.

"You ought to know better," projected Blue, along with the visual
of a blackfly transforming into a large pterodactyl.

"Where are they now?" asked Violet.

"I sent them through the portal I found and closed it. That drained
me considerably. When I felt another portal opening here, I came and
sent the summons."

"Having waited so long you didn't have strength to add any data
to your plea for assistance." Yellow was noticeably displeased, and
relieved. The combination drove home to me, and to Orange, the scale
of risk he had taken.

"I'm sorry," he projected. "I won't do it again."

"I'll taste with great delight your sea treasure,

"If you've indeed removed its shell azure."

I realized Yellow's reciting of these Ashkaran lines meant he was
forgiven on condition he really meant it when he said he wouldn't be
so reckless in future. She also fed him some energy and the rest of
us added some. His ring flared orange.

"Thanks," he projected, in a near normal tone.

"I don't sense a portal here; where is it?" asked Blue.

Orange was already transmitting his data to us at top speed. I
observed temporal and geographical diagrams arrayed in different
patterns. My mind began trying to make sense of them. I felt Yellow
and Violet analyzing them, too. Blue dropped deeper into her mind
and instantly relayed the data to Indigo.

"There's a more likely place for a portal," projected Yellow.

"I'm also getting something," projected Violet. "It appears to be
another dimensional portal three point four kilometres south of
here." This came with a visual of an empty parking lot.

I could feel some of the others probing to verify that assertion. I
joined them and, indeed, had a first hand impression that she was
not mistaken.

"Lets check it out," projected Blue, already back with us.

We agreed and joined her at the location.

We braced ourselves for the portal to swing open and for a number of
those unpleasant entities to swarm through, or, at least attempt to
swarm through. After what had happened last time, we were determined
to stop them from even entering this dimension.

We stood there for some time, almost in a state of breathless
anticipation. Then, Blue started us considering the wisdom of what
we were doing.

"It seems to me," she projected, "that there's simething just a bit
incongruous about this."

"As though," projected Orange, "they're trying to distract us
again."

I could sense Yellow nodding to that. I, too, felt the same way.
This had decoy written all over it. There was a trace of
extradimensional magic here. However, the very intense analysis
permitted by having five of us here had us noticing subtleties that
one of us on his own could more easily miss. This sense of a portal
originated from one of the vaguely worm shaped entities. It dated
from the time previous to our rounding them up, though it had been
time delayed to become active now. This suggested to us that there
could be something else quite likely to become active soon.

The instant this thought had occurred to us, we sent our mental
probe around the planet, seeking anything that would explain such a
devious deception. We maintained a continuous scrutiny of the
abandoned house in which we stood.

"There's something," projected Yellow.

At once, we all had it. There were three of the pterodactyls, and
they were not finger sized, a couple of kilometres away. At once,
our five minds were after them. We were surprised when they did not
turn to confront us. Instead they sped off as fast as they could
towards the setting sun. We rushed after them. As we neared them and
a spell of confinement was building in our minds, we felt them
quickly avoid the instinctive deflective reply. Instead they turned
their energy into a teleportation spell. Each of them appeared in a
distant area of the world, widely separated from the other two. They
seemed very intent on giving us quite a chase.

"By the Light! I don't like this," projected Blue.

"It's meant to distract us," asserted Violet. "I wonder what or
who for?"

"How about a rescue mission to Mars?" suggested Yellow.

"I don't know," projected Orange. "The ones we've imprisoned there
are pretty securely bound to that planet. I doubt whether anyone
has the capacity to rescue them."

"Maybe they don't know that," projected Violet. "Perhaps, they
think that a rescue mission is possible. If they believe it is, then
they'll likely attempt it anyway."

That assessment seemed very plausible. We agreed that three of us
check out the prison on the red planet, while the other two kept a
psychic eye open here, ready to leap across interplanetary space in
an instant. Violet, Yellow and I were chosen to go. There was a very
brief moment during which I felt the sky flicker. Then, below me lay
a reddish desert and I could sense the force field beyond which lay
the black flies. Very swiftly, our minds circled the surface of the
red planet seeking any trace of ultradimensional activity anywhere
outside the area of confinement. There was none.

"Well, we can go back," suggested Yellow.

"Hold on," projected Violet. "What's that?"

"Three pterodactyls," I replied. "They've followed us here."

I felt Yellow instantly transmit this information to Orange.

"They're confident we can handle this," she informed us. "Blue is
updating them back home."

"Harvest time," projected Violet, meaning we should get busy.

"Well," projected Yellow, "since we now have a use for one, how
about adding another containing circumference?" She visualized the
pattern of the energy distribution required and the precise methods
we'd use to lure them inside this new area, extract ourselves and
then activate it. Violet and I rapidly considered the plan and
agreed to it.

The three pterodactyls no longer sought to evade us. They flew in a
triangular formation, and I received their projected visual of a
triad of space ships pushing through us and blasting open the area
of containment.

"Wait for the exact instant," projected Yellow.

We waited as our three antagonists approached, beaming at us the
thought that they were mightier than we were. The visual was of a
spacecraft as large as the planet, a vessel all aglow, bristling
with missile launchers and energizing these as well as its beam
projectors.

I felt a slight quiver in my matrix ring, and realized that it was
chuckling. "They've been watching too much Terran TV, or plucking
such excess from your mind," came my predecessor's sentiment, or
rather commented that residue of his memory which had remained in
the ring.

"Curious," mused Violet. "They are not attempting anything except
these impressions of their superiority. As though, they either are
seeking to bluff us into running or..."

"Or," finished Yellow, "they are simply a decoy."

"Now!" projected Violet.

At once, we teleported beyond the extended frontier of the new area
of containment. Instantly, a second strip of fly paper appeared. The
image of a great enemy war vessel vanished. For a microsecond they
were again three pseudopterodactyls. Then, they were little black
flies and bound as completely to our psychic flypaper as were their
fellows.

"My suggestion," projected Yellow, "is that we not linger here.
Let's return to Earth without delay."

"Agreed," projected Violet and I made it unanimous among our Martian
expedition. We formed the spell in our minds and very quickly were
back in the skies over Ottawa. Below us lay the ordinary buildings
and the normal lights of any modern Terran city at night. Orange and
Blue joined us where our physical eyes could perceive more than from
any spot on the ground.

"I still have the strangest feeling that all of this has been to
distract us from the main event," projected Blue.

"If so, they missed a splendid opportunity," projected Orange. For
three and a half seconds, there were only two of us on Earth."

"We don't know that they haven't been busy while our attention was
so largely focused on Mars," I projected.

"Green's right," projected Violet. "Let's very attentively check to
see whether we missed anything here."

Very carefully our five minds began another psychic probe of Earth.
Once again, we were in an occult sense, passing over the various
waters and seas of this planet seeking anything not native to it.

For a moment, it was as though we had been wrong in our analysis.
There was nothing out of the ordinary. Of course, there were all
kinds of activities taking place on Earth of a magical nature.
However, all of this magic, whether light or dark, was home grown.

"Maybe that was it," projected Violet. Though I could clearly read
that this thought was born of her hope and of her fondness for my
native world, I did not have to read very deep to pick up her
expectation of further mischief.

It was Blue who formed the thought that we next focused on. It
wasn't words which formed in her mind. It was an image. We could see
a barren, sandy place, with a clear blue sky overhead.

"Presentiment?" asked Yellow and Orange at the same time.

"Let's follow this through," projected Violet.

"If it's the main event, it may be better if we're physically
present," I suggested.

"Agreed," projected Blue. The others did, too. At once, what had
been an image in her mind lay before us in reality.

We were hovering physically, with our psychic senses fully alert, in
the sky over a dry area in the Indian state of Rajasthan. For all of
a dozen microseconds, it was perfectly normal, if somewhat hot.
Then, with a suddenness truly astounding, we felt the sky begin to
alter colour and shape. Our occult sensitivities provided us with a
visual. This was of an enormous drawbridge dropping down from a
castle in the sky. Then the portcullis was drawn up and the great
double doors swung open. Out of that image of a castle in the sky
ventured something completely unexpected. It was a rabbit perhaps
half a kilometre tall.

I noticed from the minds of the others that they were seeing it
somewhat differently than was I. They were looking at an animal from
the forest of Gvihlih-hih, one also noted for its speed. It, too, in
reality was much smaller than this strange flickering reproduction
of it.

"Very little physical essence there," projected Violet.

"I'm picking up a tremendous amount of energy," reported Yellow. "A
lot of it is going into maintaining that visual distortion. However,
I can also feel energy building up for a jump. It's going to move.
Everyone be ready to follow it."

The visual distortion in the sky flickered another time. The giant
rabbit looked at us, laughed and jumped. One leap and it was gone.

"Holding link," projected Blue, as we moved rapidly to the east. We
were using her as a focus to tie us to it, so that wherever it went
we could be right behind it.

"I think we're arriving," she projected and she was right. The
atmospheric distortion caused by the swiftness of our flight faded
and we perceived ourselves in the normal Terran sky. We could see
that we had come to a place where a large body of water meets land.
Below us stretched a city. I could make out the impressive Golden
Gate Bridge. So, we were now above San Francisco.

Above that great coastal city, the sky was wavering unnaturally, as
the entity took form there. It was still projecting a visual
distortion, though the rabbit was now gone. Instead, it was a giant
porcupine hovering there in the air, glaring down at the city below.

"Careful," projected Blue. "I can feel energy building within it and
I'm getting an unpleasant image from its mind."

Then we were all reading it. We could see that it seemed willing and
able to cause an earthquake, the big one. Already, the ground was
just beginning to quiver in preparation for that.

"I see a great way to replenish our spent energy," I suggested.

"Right," came Yellow's telepathic laugh and I felt the mental smiles
of the others.

At once, our five minds reached out and gathered up the excess
energy it was hurling towards the fault. We modified and transformed
that energy into what would be constructive and useful to us. Then,
we absorbed the energy. I felt a vigour sweeping through me, a
vitality unlike anything I had previously felt.

A very weird thought pattern emerged from the entity and struck at
us. It was wavy and discordant. I felt something like a suggestion
of an earthquake of hate.

"It's not pleased," projected Blue.

We all could tell that she was right. We could read that it had not
even bothered to check for us pursuing it, feeling us incapable of
that. It hadn't been overly worried at the prospect that we might be
on its tail. It felt there was nothing we could do to interfere with
it. And we had. No, it was not pleased.

Suddenly, it was gone. All that lay below us was the city, enjoying
a normal day.

"I still have it," projected Blue, "though it's trying very hard to
cover its trail. It's moving through the Pacific."

"Let's keep after it," projected Yellow.

Once again, the five of us sped almost as fast as light on the heels
of this ultradimensional creature.

"What is it?" projected Violet.

"Thantay?" Orange asked, naming a very fierce enemy, which the
Wizard of Green had several times battled elsewhere.

"They always wore the same shape," replied Blue.

"All the more reason," suggested Orange, "for this one to try to
conceal its true shape, or at least block our perception of it. I
doubt what we are perceiving is anything close to what it really
looks like in its natural habitat."

"Changing course," projected Blue. "It's going through some kind of
portal. I think it's going to try to kill us in some other plane of
existence."

"We'd better break off direct pursuit," projected Yellow. Very
swiftly, we expressed reluctant agreement, as we realized we'd thus
lose it.

"Breaking off pursuit," projected Blue.

"Maybe we haven't lost it," projected Yellow. "I got a glimpse of
what could be its next point of impact with this planet." She
projected a visual of a northern island. I recognized it.

"What are we waiting for?" asked Blue.

An instant later, we were in the skies over Iceland. However, this
time it seemed that it had tricked us. It had placed a fake
destination in its mind for us to read, and we'd fallen for it.
Still, it had only distracted us for half a second, which was how
long it took us to realize the reason for the extra volcanic
activity on Kamchatka.

"Let's go!" urged Blue. Almost instantly we were in the smoke
covered skies above an erupting volcano. The giant porcupine was
hovering a kilometre ahead of us. We could feel its immense
displeasure that we had so swiftly tracked it down. It seemed
unaware that its utterly alien thought patterns could not be
completely cloaked from us, though it certainly was trying very
hard.

Then we noticed it flicking one of its quills towards a distant
volcano. It was intending to use another immense energy pulse to
ignite yet another volcano.

"We can use some more energy," projected Yellow. We agreed. Once
more we reached out with our psychic will to scoop up the quill. We
scooped it up and pulled it back to us. We again transformed and
soaked up that destructive energy. Again, the entity's offensive
energy was the source of our revitalization. My own system was now
tingling vibrantly. I could read that the others felt exactly the
same way. It was doing a very good job of ensuring that we were in
top form to enter any confrontation with it.

"It has more energy than any thantay I ever faced," I projected,
passing on the awed astonishment of the personalities in the ring.

"Yes," Yellow projected. "This entity seems almost to have unlimited
ability. It continues to shield itself relatively well against all
our efforts to get a clue as to its actual identity, if, indeed, we
ever have encountered a creature of its kind before. Perhaps this is
a completely new life form for us.

"It's getting ready to jump again," projected Blue. The smouldering
volcano below us stilled. The form of the porcupine flickered and
faded from the sky.

"I'm getting an image of a great island north of the North American
continent," projected Blue.

"Baffin Island?" I wondered telepathically.

"Another false image, perhaps," projected Violet.

"Let's drop to the equator," Orange suggested. Instantly, we agreed
and acted on that logical thought to overcome its misdirection.

"I don't sense it," projected Blue.
