Hi, Irene.

Many thanks for your message inviting me to sign a petition asking 
Stephen Harper to do something to create more good jobs. I appreciate 
your efforts for employment, etc. and I figure you're able to organize 
well. I understand there's an election this year and you would know 
what's politically effective. When it comes to creating jobs, I don't 
think petitions to Stephen Harper are as productive as going ahead and 
helping change attitudes, bolstering the self esteem of those 
structurally unemployed and organizing their participation in what needs 
to be done.

For example, some of the unemployed, trained if necessary, could join 
active construction workers donating time and effort to build inexpensive 
housing, the land and materials for which can be donated or provided 
inexpensively due to the philanthropic nature of the project.

I draw your attention to the 1883 visionary work "The Dominion in 1983" 
by Ralph Centennius, one of whose items is that high minded, well to do 
patriots provided comfortable housing for Canada's less fortunate. This 
Victorian work contains many valuable points, among which is that Canadians 
in 1983 live comfortably in a high tech northern nation attracting people 
to study and marvel at Canada's accomplishments.

In our 21st Century, some of those unemployed can use their time helping 
to ascertain optimum locations for inexpensive housing, including by providing 
the nation with greater depth away from the border; some can consider sources 
for funding (encouraging classical or other architects, environmentalists, 
even space enthusiasts eager to stimulate initial steps to offplanet 
habitation, etc. to contribute to showcase their work and ideals); others can 
pursue scientific and medical lines of thought, study and teach languages, 
literatures, cultures, etc.; all can feel good and connected to Canada's 
beneficial enhancement.

Those who want can keep a tab as to what they feel their work is worth. The 
main point is to change the channel from current society's fostering of low 
self esteem among those having time but little money for trips outside the 
country or products advantaging foreign companies. Let them feel good by 
patriotically avoiding those things and using their time to truly better 
Canada. Let those with money also patriotically travel within Canada and 
purchase Canadian.

I think helping to organize this kind of thing is something you and many you 
know can accomplish, ever careful to ensure anyone involved has no 
opportunity for financial or other lapses of integrity.

Thanks again for your message. I hope whatever other pressing demands occur 
on your time, you'll also be able to focus some on achieving what is possible, 
regardless of the priorities of Stephen Harper.

Very Best Wishes,

Michael
