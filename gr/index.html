<H1>Graeco Roman</H1>
"Classical" literature, that written by the ancient Greeks and Romans, once formed the educational foundation the West. Michael McKenny, in the last half of the 20th Century, was rare in keenly studying Classics. Had the Solarguard webpage been available those decades ago, likely the Classics would have formed a very prominent part of it.<p>

Many of the ideas, understandings and behaviours of Westerners up to the present time can be understood better by an awareness of the Classical foundation. This solarguard section is an attempt concisely to communicate this situation. Solarguard Graeco-Roman was last updated on December 28, 2008 with minor editing of this index page. The last substantial addition was the summary of M. Cary's and E.H. Warmington's The Ancient Explorers added on December 26, 2008. In addition to that summary, this Graeco-Roman section of Solarguard presently offers brief reviews and notes on the Histories of Herodotus and Thucydides, on Xenophon's "Anabasis", on Appian's Civil Wars, on Cassius Dio's Books 50-52, on Rome's famous orator Cicero, on the Roman historians Livy and Tacitus, on Pliny the Younger's letters and on John Percival's book on the Roman villa. Here also are Michael McKenny's 1988 essay on Ptolemy and Seleucus, the beginning of a file on L. Sprague de Camp's Dragon of the Ishtar Gate and a link to the Perseus Greco-Roman resource page.<p> 

Michael McKenny's essay on Julian and some reviews of books concerning paganism in the Roman empire may be found in the pagan section. A few of Michael McKenny's translations of Latin poems may be seen in the poetry section.<p>
