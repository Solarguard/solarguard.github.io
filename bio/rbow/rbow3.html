RAINBOW Michael McKenny

Chapter Three Response

I passed three students so preoccupied with their conversation that
they failed to notice me. I had to step aside or they would have
walked into me. Without intending to I caught some of the words
that held them so enthralled. Then I listened very carefully, with
my ears and my keenest psychic attention.

"I know there are lots of occult groups around," a girl was saying.
"I know some pagans, but I don't think any of them would be involved
in anything like this."

"Absolutely," came a male voice.  "If you knew them better, you'd
know they're not likely to be wandering around cemeteries at night
wearing black robes. These dead guys and whoever wasted them were
very different."

"They say they were all burned as if some kind of acid was thrown at
them," came another female voice.

"That's awful," said the first. "I didn't hear that."

I was already at the doors of the library. However, I had learned
more than I'd wanted to. As Philip's abnormal meditation strongly
suggested, there had been no time factor in Kevin's dream. He had
been experiencing something that was happening 'live' as they say. I
gave a mental sigh. It would have been more reassuring to have found
out that he'd happened to catch something from at least as long ago
as the 70s. Then, as long as the dark entity wasn't into time
travel, there'd be no further trouble.

As I walked up the stairs inside the library towards the history
section on the fifth floor, my mind carefully reviewed and weighed
all the information at its disposal. I tried to wave aside the dark
impressions that clung to the memories I had of Philip's meditation,
Kevin's dream and the news report of the cemetery murders. Yet,
somehow that proved very hard to do. It was almost as if I'd
acquired a black cloud inside my head.

The thought came to me that the very sense of gloom and doom, which
was affecting me could be an active psychic emanation from the
extraterrestrial entity. In Kevin's dream it had used fear. Just
maybe, it's ability to project emotions such as fear and depression
was its greatest magical accomplishment. Were that true we could
have less to worry about than we feared, so long as we could master
our fear.

I made a point of doing a mental banishing ritual to get rid of any
external fear which I may have picked up. This would also do a good
job of balancing my own state of mind. I tried to correlate the
various items of information I had. the one overriding impression
that clung to me was that this thing was not only praeter-human but
extra-terrestrial, and possibly ultra-dimensional. I hoped that I
was wrong, or if I was right that it would still turn out to be an
insignificant threat. I debated and decided against contacting the
Council again.

I read for a while, and then made my way to the class, which this
time was in a shorter, but longer, building on the other side of the
library. Once again, I chose the stairs, this time to the third
floor. Kevin was not in this class. I simply nodded to the others
there, and opened my note book.

When the professor came in he looked at me and said, "Ah, Mr. Green,
the department secretary said that there was a phone call for you.
She gave me this note to pass on to you." I stood up and went up to
him. There seemed to be a glint in his eye, as though he and the
secretary had found something a little humorous in the note.

"Thank you," I said, wondering who in the world would be calling me
at the university. I waited till I got back to my desk before
opening and reading the note, which was very brief. It said simply,
"Call Mr. Orange" and provided a telephone number.

I did my best to control my expression. I could see how someone
might find it a bit amusing that a Mr. Green was getting a call from
a Mr. Orange. I did not really know anyone named Mr. Orange, but I
certainly knew the Wizard of Orange. I had known him for hundreds of
years longer than there were telephones on Earth. Yet, I decided
that we could do without any theatrics. I certainly felt like just
jumping up and dashing out the room to the closest pay phone.
However, I simply leaned back in my chair, folded my arms and waited
for the professor to begin the lecture.

This was a Classics course, as opposed to a Latin or Greek one. Here
we were not primarily concerned with how to translate Ammianus
Marcellinus, but with the history of the Late Empire, and today we
were to cover the last years of Constantius II, which meant the rise
of Julian. Normally, such enormously intersting material would have
occupied my full attention. However, now as I sat there listening to
the professor begin his account of the young philosopher who was
suddenly thrust into a military role, my mind was swiftly pursuing
the ramifications of the note.

The Council had considered my report serious enough, or perhaps they
had additional information, to dispatch another member to this
planet. The Wizard of Orange had to get in touch with me, and
amazingly felt there was a need to be very cautious about the use of
telepathy. Why else would he have gone to the trouble of finding a
phone book to look up the number of the Classics Department, when he
could have contacted me at the speed of thought? This was very
disquieting.

How had he come by that phone anyway? I would have expected him to
have simply appeared in my apartment, but that sure was not my phone
number. The first three digits indicated it was located somewhere in
Centretown. And what else had he been up to since he got here, which
could only have been a couple of hours ago, at the most?

At last, the hour long lecture on the Caesar Julian was over and I
calmly walked out the door. If the professor and the secretary were
hoping I'd go to the office to make my call, they were disappointed.
I simply went to the nearest pay phone on the ground floor of this
building, dropped in my quarter and dialed the number on the slip of
paper, which I'd been handed.

The phone did not even complete its first ring before the receiver
was lifted. "Hello, Green," came a voice I recognized very well.

"Hi. I didn't know you were in town," I said. Nobody seemed to be
listening. Still, I was playing this as safely as he wished.

"When Blue passed on your message, we decided it would be a good
idea for me to come. She came, too."

"What's up?" I prompted.

"We found something very interesting. It would take too long to go
into, especially over the phone. Why don't you drop over here when
you're free. What time does your last class finish?"

"Three thirty," I said. "If it's urgent I can skip it and come
earlier?" It was difficult to repress the urge to simply ask him
telepathically what by the Woods was going on, but I managed to
restrain my curiosity and impatience.

"Oh, no. If we see you around four, that will be fine."

"Where are you staying?" I asked.

He mentioned a downtown address which I instantly impressed on my
memory.

"Okay," I said. "I'll be there."

"Great. We'll look forward to seeing you."

"And I'll look forward to it, too," I said. "If I remember correctly
the number 7 bus goes close by there." I had stressed the word bus.
I wasn't expecting him to know the bus routes, and he understood and
answered the unspoken question.

"Exactly," he replied, in an emphatic tone. He had just confirmed my
suspicion that he considered any use of magic on my part prior to
our meeting to be extremely unwise.

"Good. Well, I'll be looking forward to it. Take care."

"You, too. Bye."

He hung up, and I walked slowly down to the cafeteria in the
basement. I sat down, setting my backpack on the floor. I opened it
and took out my lunch and my copy of THE THOUGHT OF CICERO, an
anthology of short Latin passages from his philosophical works. The
lunch consisted of two peanut butter sandwiches. Not only were they
fairly nutritious and tasty, but they fit in well with my cover.
Wasting no more time on something I couldn't proceed with until I
had more data, I filed in the back of my mind the whole question of
the visit of Orange and Blue and opened the book.

After sitting there eating and reading for ten or fifteen minutes, I
got up, put my lunch bag, now empty, in my backpack and walked over
to the nearest water cooler. After my drink, I set off through the
tunnels for the library.

Kevin was standing just outside the inner doors to the library. It
was clear that he was waiting for me.

"Hi," I said.

"Hello," he replied. "I hear that the secretary got a telephone
message for you." I could also see from the surface of his mind that
outside of having memorised the phone number, he knew the entire
message. So much for privacy.

I shrugged. "Yes," I said.

"Well, was it anything interesting, anything connected with what
happened in the cemetery?" he asked. "You heard about that, right?"

"Yes."

"Are you allowed to talk about that phone call?"

"Can't see why I can't tell you what it's all about," I said, though
really, of course, there was no way I could tell him everything.
"Mr. Orange is a good friend of mine. He just arrived from out of
town and I'm to drop over after class." I didn't even add that Blue
had come.

"Interesting," he said. "But you still haven't said whether this has
anything to do with dreams, magic and Toronto?"

"Well, Mr. Orange does have some background in what you would call
the Occult," I said with some remarkable understatement. "If you
agree, I can mention your dream to him." I could see that Kevin was
imagining a wise old adept, possibly even the head of my esoteric
fraternity.

"Sure," he said out loud. "I'd be very grateful for whatever help I
can get."

"Okay, I'll do it."

"Green," said Kevin, "I have the feeling that you know a bit more
about these things than I do. Still, there's one thing I feel very
strongly about, and that's the danger element. I hope you'll not
underestimate it. I'm sure your Mr. Orange, especially if he's a
great adept, would agree with me."

"Yes, I'm sure he does," I said. "He wouldn't be here, if he didn't
think there was something serious going on. And, I've known him long
enough to respect his intuitions. I just hope that you're both
wrong, as no doubt do you."

The rest of the day actually passed quickly. When the Cicero class
was finished, Kevin and I walked to the bus stop together.

"I just came to see you off," he said. "I think I'll stay and do
some more searching in the library."

"Good luck," I said.

"Thanks. Say hello to your friend for me."

"Will do," I replied. "Are you planning anything special this
evening?"

He looked at me with a quizzical expression.

"Just in case we need to get in touch. Look, you've convinced me
this could be serious. So, let's treat it seriously and have a clear
idea what each of us is up to."

"Oh, I just plan to spend a quiet evening, doing some more research
to see if I can figure out what exactly we're up against."

"Okay. When do you think you'll be home?"

"Much of what I want is in my own notes at home. I'll probably only
be here another hour or so. Just maybe, I'll check out the library
at Ottawa University, but I'm not too hopeful about finding anything
there either."

"There's a chance," I said, "that Mr. Orange will want to talk to
you personally about your dream. It may be a good idea, if we can
reach you, say around six or soon after."

"Okay, that decides it. I'll make it a point to be home by six. If I
haven't finished at Ottawa U. by then, I'll still come home for your
call, and go back to Ottawa University after supper. And just maybe,
I'll have something for you," he added with a smile.

"I'll look forward to it," I said and then jabbed a finger at the
bus, which was just pulling up.

"Okay. Take care."

"You, too," I replied as I stepped toward the bus.

I sat there staring pensively out the window as the bus made its way
down Sunnyside, did its little dip to the south and then turned back
towards Bank Street, along which it would travel as far north as the
street went. The address Orange had given me meant I should get off
around Bank and Gladstone and walk a couple of blocks west. However,
two minutes or so before we got there, a strange sensation swept
over me. I felt dizzy. I closed my eyes. There was a ringing in my
ears. A whiff of something other than gasoline and motor exhaust
assailed my nostrils. In my mind's eye, I glimpsed something like a
shadow or tentacle. It coiled like a serpent into the shape of the
letter "S". It seemed to reach for me. I could feel it sliding
across my psychic defenses. Then it was gone and I felt perfectly
normal again.

I quickly opened my eyes and looked around at the other passengers
on the bus. They all appeared to be perfectly at ease. It occurred
to me that the "S" could stand for the name of another street,
fairly close to where I had intended to get off. So I waited the
extra couple of stops. Someone else rang the bell. I stood up and
followed the others who were getting off at that stop.

When my feet touched the sidewalk and I saw where I was, a thought
bubbled up to consciousness. This was the closest stop to one of the
best esoteric book stores in the city.

I smiled inwardly as I crossed Bank Street and walked along towards
the store. It occurred to me that this wouldn't be a bad place to
try to spot traces of any human allies of that malefic entity,
assuming it had human allies. Then again, like myself, it could be
assuming the form of a Terran. In any case, it could well seek out
this book store, widely known as a good source for works on magic
and esoteric topics, some of which couldn't easily be found
elsewhere in town.

As I opened the door, the beneficent sound of chimes greeted my ears
and the sweet odour of incense wafted to my nostrils. This store
offered the modern witch and magician not only books, but a great
variety of occult accessories, including candles, crystals, incense
and a wide selection of tarot decks. Usually, it was books I was
most interested in.

I did not sense anything psychically negative here, though I was
very careful not to let my guard down and not to send out even a
Terran probe. This time I walked first to the section of tarot
cards. Terran divination systems were especially fascinating both
for the similarities and dissimilarities they have to those back
home. None of our systems had produced the pictorial variety which
allowed for so many different tarot decks.

I thought that since I was here, there was no harm in checking to
see whether they had anything new and valuable. They didn't. Then I
shook my head, as if to clear it of my anxiety. There, a sense of
calm was beginning to flow over me. I allowed myself to look
carefully at the books on mythology. I saw a few in this section
whick hadn't been there the last time I was here. I was about to
pick one up, when I gagged, reeled and almost fell.

The incense was overpowering. No, that wasn't incense. It was
something else, something non-physical. I was now aware of an
exceptionally strong psychic stench which seemed to permeate the
whole store, though it was concentrated in the Hermetic section. I
looked there and saw nothing out of the ordinary, leastwise with my
physical eyes. No one was even standing there.

However, as I struggled to avoid coughing and tightly pulled my
defensive spells around me, I was aware of a small distortion in the
air. An object about the size of a large coin suddenly just appeared
on a shelf there in front of THE BOOK OF THE SACRED MAGIC OF
ABRAMELIN THE MAGE.

At first, it looked more like a gem or a small stone. However,
almost immediately its shape shifted and it appeared to be no
different than any other doubloon. It was not content with this
assumption of normality. Even as I stood there intently
concentrating on my psychic shields, I could mentally hear its
projection of great displeasure. I cringed and there was a grating
across the Enochian outer garment of my defensive spells.

"Slave," it uttered, "slave, why do you hesitate? Come."

Then I could feel it become aware of me. "No, wait. You are not the
one I seek. You are some miserable Terran dabbler. The fool. Where
is he? I see. He came too early. To the exact spot he came, but half
an hour early. Now, I must pursue that incompetent. There is so
little time."

And then there was no coin there, normal or otherwise. It was gone.
Even the air smelled right again. There was no indication, aside
from memory, that anything out of the ordinary had transpired.

Obedient to the strong message from my colleague, I resisted the
temptation to try following this up with a psychic probe. It was
fascinating that I had picked up something of this intensity from
what appeared to be an alien artifact whose dimensions permitted it
to assume the shape of a common Terran coin. And I had received its
thoughts, even with my shields up, and no active effort at detection
on my part. The several other people here, though, including the
proprietor, appeared to have been completely unaware of it.

I walked slowly to the shelves containing books about Hermetic and
ritual magic. There was an occult odour here. There were negative
vibrations, fairly strong ones which I guessed had been left by the
"slave" the doubloon had failed to meet here. I received, even
without active effort, an impression of urgency. He had been as
distressed as the coin. I wondered who or what he was, and how far
away from me he stood in space and time.

Still, I took no chances. In addition to refraining from all use of
my extrasensory abilities, I tried to behave in a completely normal
manner. I didn't want him or his master to feel any need to
investigate me more closely, at least not until I'd met my fellow
Colours. This wouldn't prevent me from behaving as a normal human
"dabbler" and trying to obtain a little information in a perfectly
normal manner.

First, I made a point of concentrating on the books and appearing
completely oblivious to anyone else in the store. There actually was
a work by John Dee that was very appealing. However, I didn't have
the money on me to buy it.

After several minutes the store emptied of its customers, and I was
left alone with the proprietor. Slowly, I made my way over to him.
He looked up. His eyes quickly took in the fact that I, a regular
customer, carried no book. I could tell that the odour I'd detected
did not originate with him.

"Excuse me," I said, "wasn't there someone here not long ago asking
after something very unusual?" From my tone you'd almost think that
I was disappointed I'd been beaten to it.

A frown crossed his brow. "Funny you should ask," he said. "About
half an hour ago, I did have a rather curious request. It wouldn't
be Zandala's Grimoire you're looking for, would it?"
