Kindly note that I made this summary for personal study, handwriting it, actually hand printing it, for legibility. I have now typed it up to be placed on my web page. It remains an item for personal study. So, for example, I'm not being careful to place quotation marks around everything that is an exact quote of the author. Ater all, the whole thing is Carl J. Friedrich's, mangled by me as I compress it from some 325 pages to 13.

x  Professor Friedrich approaches this period from a European viewpoint and as an expression that baroque is a state pf mind.

xi This study has occupied a good part of my last twenty years. This period is one of the richest and most fully explored of Western Europe's history. These two generations had many towering individuals. It was an age of giants, who created Leviathan, the state. Power its dynamic essence; justice, liberty and culture its incidental products. Intuition, rather than sympsthy.

I i. (1-3) Europe in 1610: the Setting: In 1610 the emerging state was not obvious. Some sought to re-establish united Christendom. The Empire seemed strong. In 1610 the Empire was a Hapsburg territory, with numerous sovereign German princes, etc. France was a modern national state, one of three (with England and the Netherlands) economic centres. Mercantilism was widely accepted. 
ii. (3-5) Population: Precise numbers are unavailable. Estimates include: the Empire 20 million, France 16 million, Italy 13 million, Spain with Portugal 10 million, England with Wales 4.5 million, etc. Europe was largely rural. Cities were trade centres or national capitals.
iii. (5-9) Commerce and Finance: There was a shift in trade. England and the Netherlands became more involved. The New World featured prominently, including with new products, e.g. tobacco and potatoes. New World silver and gold were important. Trading companies, banking families (e.g. Fugger), stocks were characteristic of the age. Hansa's great days were over. The state became a source of credit; war a state industry. Amsterdam and London thriving exchanges.
iv. (9-12) Industry and Agriculture: Factories grew with large numbers of workers in textiles, mining, smelting, printing, etc. Scientific advances were too basic and abstract to afffect industry. Great setbacks to agricultural production were caused by the wars of this period. Improvements were fertilizers and fallow crops. The study of botany and botanical gardens became popular.
v. (12-14) Mercantilism as a System of Power: There are various ideas as to the meaning of mercentilism. Essentially, mercentilism assigns the state the central role in arranging for economic wellbeing. Economic wellbeing was seen as necessary for war and conquest. Widespread government regulation was favored by leaders across the political spectrum. Mercentilists believed that one state's economic gain mathematically meant foreign loss. Colonies, sea power, bullion mined or seized, then successful trade were viewed as key.
vi. (14-22) The State Versus the Estates: Mercentilist thought was absolutist thought that appropriate legislation and policy could mold social environment. Raison d'Etat, originating in G. Botero's (1540-1617) famous book, indicated beneficial state intent for its controlling actions. The Tudors in England had exemplified absolutism. Kings had able ministers. There is a distinction between etat and etates. Etates could be a variety of lesser beings: clergy, nobility, squirearchy, municipalities and peasants, for example. They were ideally representatives of the entire community. Generally estates swore an oath of allegiance to a prince swearing to fulfil his obligations, and estates controlled special taxes. Estates inefficiency in war led princes to seek to discard them. By Hobbes's time the system had been secularized. Hobbes did not attempt Biblical underpinnings for his authoritarian system.
vii. (22-25) The Law of Nature and the Laws of Nature: Althusius and Grotius: People considered the concept of natural law and the issue of who was sovereign and what sovereignity included. Althusius attributed sovereignity to the estates; Grotius attributed it to human reason.
viii. (25-27) State and Sovereignity: All thinkers saw a need for a sovereign. Some saw him bound by contract. Some saw sovereugnty based on natural law.
ix. (27-30) Thomas Hobbes: Philosopher of Power: Hobbes thought that absolute monarchy was the best form of government, that natural law was based on observable fact or what the monarch decreed. His first law of nature is that all should seek peace if possible, and only if peace fails seek advantages in war. Hobbes, in a sense the founder of psychology, saw human action determined by passions, restrained by fear. Hobbes, as many philosophers, identified as human. Spinoza noted that might is right.
x. (30-34) English Constitutional Ideas: Milton and Harrington: In England there was strong feeling that the law and the estates were above the king. Hence, the execution of the king. John Milton in his Areopagitica asserted the freedom of opinion, especially the freedom of published opinion. John Harrington (1611-1677) held that property owners were the ultimate power. 
xi. (34-36) The Bourgeois Element: Contract is a concept of the middle class merchant. In Europe by 1660 the bourgeoisie strongly supported monarchy. Jesuits advanced arguments for papal supremecy. Bourgeois rejected them.
xii. (36-37) Conclusion: Men now felt that they could shape their society, their destiny. In this period the modern state emerged.

II i. (38-43) The Problem of the Baroque: Originally a term of denigration, baroque has been keenly debated. Despite nationalist assertions, baroque was European. Some have claimed baroque a product of the Counter Reformation, though Protestants also contributed to it. Some note its flourishing in the courts of absolute monarchs, though clergy and bourgeois contributed, too. 
ii. (43-45) The Common Ground: The Restless Search for Power: Baroque established the foundations of modern science and also persecuted witches. Baroque statesmen made a cult of power.
iii. (45-47) Personal Behavior: It was an age of wigs, elaborate clothing, masques, duels, sensual excess, the beginning of psychology, cataclysmic rise and fall.
iv. (47-64) Poetry and Literature: (a) England: Milton's Satan best portrays Baroque man. Renaissance and metaphysical elements were present. There were contrasts: Catholic vs Protestants, king vs constitutionalists.
(b) Spain: Spain witnessed enormous literary activity, thousands of plays. These plays conveyed the importance of honor. Illusionism, life as a dream, appears in Lope de Vega and Calderon. Gongora wrote dark plays. Calderon was a Catholic poet.
(c) France: Some say France was rococo, not baroque, but what is rococo if not a lighter and more gracious baroque. Corneille founded French tragedy on a Spanish base. Corneille's Le Cid was the drama of honor par excellence. Moliere's thirty odd great comedies belong to the decade beyond 1660.
(d) Holland and Germany: Vondel was Holland's greatest dramatist. Vondel had become Catholic by the time he wrote Lucifer. Vondel also wrote many lyrics. German poets included melancholic Gryphius and the stylist Martin Opitz. There was also the novelist von Grimmelshausen with his adventure story Simplicius Simplicissimus..
v. (64-65) Allegory and Mysticism: These lie at the heart of John Donne's poetry. Angelus Silesius converted to Catholicism and wrote mystical poetry.
vi. (65) Conclusion: Power, human achievement suggested future potential.

III i. (66-73) Architecture and Sculpture: Baroque architecture began in Italy. The earliest Baroque building is Il Gesu, built by the Jesuits in Rome 1568 to 1584. Early Baroque fills the late Sixteenth Century. Soon after 1600 its full flowering in Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, studded the European landscape with castles and churches, bridges and fountains, theaters and country houses. Lorenzo Bernini was outstanding in sculpture and architecture. There were a number of impressive architects, sculptors and artists across Europe. England's dominant figure was Inigo Jones, more Classical than Baroque. Rhythm, the relationship of the various rooms of a building, the flowing stair cases, was a marked Baroque feature. Construction often took longer than the fifty years set aside for this volume. Bernini was impressive for example with his statue of St Theresa and his sepulcher of Innocent VIII.
ii. (73-82) Painting: There were many outstanding Baroque painters, Rubins (1577-1640) the most brilliant. Rubins had a large workshop and many assistants, Van Dyck perhaps the most famous. Among Spanish artists, Velasquez was a very striking Baroque figure. Murillo was probably the most universally admired Spanish painter. France presents the problem of the use of the term classicism as antithetical to baroque. Rembrandt was a Dutch artist, an artist of universal significance and an artist clearly Baroque. His Nightwatch has been called the greatest Baroque painting.
iii. (83-87) Integrated Wholes: City, Castle, Opera: Many cities have grown naturally. Some emerged whole, others were planned, but not built. Castles and palaces may be seen as Baroque equivalents of Gothic cathedrals. The concept of wholeness saw careful setting of palaces and castles in landscaped gardens. A new Baroque art form emerged, the opera. This was a blending into one of several arts: music, painting, scupture, and architecture into one whole. They were often performed in the open during great festivals. They could be considerable. On February 27, 1639, there were 3,500 spectators, including Mazarin.
iv. (87-91) Music: Baroque achieved contrapuntal music in the period of this volume. It continued well beyond. Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643) wrote operas and developed the madrigal. Carissimi (1605-1674) wrote melodic oratorios. Frescobaldi (1583-1643) wrote and impressively performed music for the organ. England and France had little noteworthy music in this period. Germany had much church music.
v. (92) Conclusion: Among the numerous Baroque evidences of art, one finds the sense of power, and the confrontation of cosmic relationships, a style that started by its contrasts. The name came from its critics unable to appreciate its intensity, vitality and grandeur. Baroque continued beyond the period of this volume.

IV (93) Renaissance scientific measurement became predominant in the Seventeenth Century. Science and religion were closely related. Science continued its triumphant advance.
i. (93-95) Catholicism and Protestantism: By 1610 Protestantism had lost fervor. The Counter Reformation was at high tide, though many were simply tired of the disunity. Grotius sought to present what all could accept. The Jesuits, seeking to retake the North, over reached themselves.
ii. (95-97) The Jesuits: Since their founding in 1540, the Jesuits played a significant rold in the Counter Reformation: as confessors to rulers, as leaders of revived Catholic education, as keenly concerned contributors to Europe's intellectual and artistic currents. They were criticized for the extent of their involvement in worldly matters. Their concept of sin as voluntary deviation from divine rule was attacked by many, including Pascal.
iii. (97-!00) The Jansenists and Pascal: Cornelius Jansen (1585-1638) sought mystical and pietistic interpretation of the Bible. His Augustinus appeared posthumously in 1640. He and his school remained ardent Catholics. His followers established themselves at Port Royal near Paris. Pope Innocent X declared five Jansenist positions heretical. The Jansenists denied that these were Jansenist positions. Pascal opposed Jesuit thought. Louis XIV condemned the Jansenists. Pascal, citing St Augustine and St Thomas, held that reason determined unrevealed truth.  Science prevails over authority.
iv. (101-103) The Inner Light: J.J. Bohme: Throughput the history of Christianity, there has been this mysticism and the feeling that everyone could be mystical. J.A. Comenius (1592-1670) advocated scientific research and universal learning. He issued a stirring plea for universal peace. Thomas Browne (1605-1682) wrote Religio Medici, published in 1643. J.J. Bohme wrote of his mystical visions. 
v. (103-105) Anglicanism and Calvinism: Calvinists strongly favored predestination and disparaged reason. Anglicans inclined to free will and practical ethics.
vi. (105-109) Science Against Superstition: Astronomy Versus Astrology: Superstition, belief in and execution of witches, occurred as science advanced. Galileo built a telescope and observed the solar system more clearly. Religious authority forced him to recant his words concerning the movement of the Earth around the Sun. Nevertheless, science based on experience and math emerged.
vii. (109-111) Galileo and Kepler: Galileo favored experiment and calculation, Kepler mathematical speculation. Kepler listed one thousand and five stars.
viii. (111-113) Mathematics of the Infinite: Fermat and Descartes discovered analytical geometry in the 1630s. John Napier and Henry Briggs c. 1615 invented the system of logarhithms. 
ix. (113-117) Descartes and Pascal: Pascal objected to Pascal's attempt to deal scientifically with first causes. Pascal had had a mystical experience.
x. (117-119) Anatomy and Physiology: Harvey: William Harvey (1578-1657), a great pioneer in experimental science, discovered the circulation of the blood. 
xi. (119-122) Mechanistic Politics and Psychology: Hobbes made a radical effort to interpret man and the state as mechanisms.
xii. (122-123) Pantheism and Naturalism: In 1663 Descartes's writings were put on the Index. All churches objected to scientific writings. Spinoza formulated pantheism.

V i. (124-125) Introduction: 1610 began with many lands in decline and under weak rule. France and Holland were strong. There was a tense division of Catholics and Protestants. 
ii. (125-126) The Issue of the Julich-Cleves Succession: When John William died without male heirs, the Emperor and two Protestants claimed the succession. The Protestants, with Dutch arms, seized Dusseldorf, the capital. The Emperor occupied the fortress of Julich. France invaded.
iii. (126-129) The Grand Design: King Henry IV of France had the concept of a Federation of Europe.
iv. (129-131) The Death of Henry IV: Henry planned war against the Hapsburgs. He was assassinated on May 14,1610. 
v. (131-136) The England of James I: The Parliament: James was learned, tolerant, of good will, but vain, stubborn and a poor judge of men. James dissolved Parliament in February 1611. The Parliament of the middle classes was patriotic and Protestant. Parliament in 1610 had reasserted constitutional government against royal prerogative. James hoped to unite divided Christendom. His efforts to have his heir, Charles, marry the Spanish Infanta, Anne of Austria, failed.
vi. (136-139) The Union and the League: Germany was divided into the Catholic League and the Protestant Union. Maximillian of Bavaria, a very able statesman and military leader, headed the League. The Protestants lacked such clear leadership. 
vii. (139-143) Emperor Mathias: Protestants exerted the estates in face of a conservative Catholic Hapsburg monarchy. Mathias sought unity and compromise. There was fighting in 1614 in Julich, Wesel, etc. Mathias was not energetic. He died in 1618.
viii. (144-147) Dutch Politics: The independent Dutch lacked harmony. Factions and individuals were affected by the death of Henry IV of France and by England's James I's attempt to pursue a marriage for his son with the Spanish Infanta. Theological disputes over predestination and James's view of absolute monarchy were also factors weakening English-Dutch ties.
ix. (147-150) Oldenbarneveld and Maurice of Nauseau: Oldenbarneveld and his faction stood for toleration, sanity and the constitution. Maurice had popular support for the calling of a national synod. Oldenbarneveld's opposition  to calls for a West India Company cost him the support of many merchants frustrated with the East India Company's monopoly. In August of 1618 Oldenbarneveld was arrested, tried and in May of 1619 beheaded.
x. (150-151) The Netherlands and Spain: Inconclusive fighting resumed when the truce ended in 1621. Spain focused more attention on Italy. Spain's economy was weak.
xi. (151-154) The Puritans: The Puritans also placed ecclesiastical above secular authority. They blended with Parliament sentiment and economic self interest against the King.
xii. (154-157) The Pilgrim Fathers: First fleeing to Holland, they came to Plymouth in 1620. Many others settled along the Atlantic coast. Puritans and other settlers felt frontier democratic, co-operative influences.
xiii. (157-160) Colonial Rivalry: The Dutch seized Spanish territory in the New World and East Asia. Their focus was trade. England's was more toward settlement. France under Richelieu's influence strengthened holdings in Canada.

VI i. (161-163) Introduction: War of Religion: Religion was a major factor in the Thirty Years' War.
ii. (163-169) Estates Versus King: The Bohemian War: The Hapsburgs considered Bohemia hereditary. Protestants disagreed, but were divided. Ferdinand was elected Emperor on August 28, 1619. Several days before, he was deposed as King of Bohemia. Frederick was elected, but poorly supported. His troops were disorderly and soundly defeated at White Mountain on November 8, 1620. Catholics followed up the victory with executions, religious compulsion and property confiscation.
iii. (169-173) The Danish Phase: Protestants turned to Denmark's Christian IV and Sweden's Gustavus Adolphus for support. The two had faught each other and Gustavus was preoccupied with his Polish adventure. Christian headed Protestant efforts, inadequately supported to handle the scale of Catholic might. Wallenstein led 24,000 men in support of the Catholic League. Christian sought to split Catholic forces, lost anyway to Wallenstein's deputy Tilly. Then Wallenstein took most of Denmark. The port of Stralsund, sustained from the sea, resisted. The Peace of Lubech (May 22, 1629) restored most of Denmark to Christian.
iv. (173-177) The Edict of Restitution: Reaction Triumphant: Emperor Ferdinand's March 8, 1629 edict claimed all alienated Church land. All Protestants understood the threat. The Pope, Urban VIII, saw Hapsburgs as rivals. Gonzaga, ardent supprter of the Counter Reformation, became Duke of Mantua. Wallenstein was dismissed. German consolidation did not Occur.
v. (177-187) Foreign Intervention: The Swedish Challenge: On July 4, 1630, Gustavus Adolphus, victor over Denmark, Poland and Russia, landed in Germany. This great warrior king charged to oppose the Counter Reformation. He was supported and partly funded by Cardinal Richelieu. French support enabled Gustavus Adolphus to compel the support of reluctant Protestant princes. Gustavus's hesitation allowed Magdeburg to fall. Its destruction galvanized relectant Protestants. Gustavus won a clear victory at Breitenfeld on September 7, 1631. For a year he swept through Catholic held lands. In September 1632 he failed to capture Wallenstein's camp, fell back, then went after Wallenstein, who was invading Saxony. He defeated Wallenstein at Lutzen on November 6, 1632, but was killed in the battle. The war continued with neither side able to achieve complete victory. Wallenstein was executed on February 24, 1634, and in September 1634 the Catholics won a victory at Nordlingen. The future Ferdinand III retook much of southern Germany for Catholicism. Richelieu then moved to prevent total Hapsburg victory. 
vi. (187-189) Modern State Versus Medieval Empire: A Compromise Peace? The Peace of Prague in 1635 might have ended the war had not France and Sweden wished so keenly to weaken the Hapsburgs. Emperor Ferdinand died in 1637.
vii. (189-196) French Intervention and the Peace of Westphalia: Initially, France suffered defeats. Richelieu persevered. Conde won a great victory at Rocroy in 1643. Sweden's young Queen Christina, the new Pope Innocent X and the Dutch, now fearing France more then the Hapsburgs, sought peace. Five years of complicated negotiations, while ighting continued, inally produced the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. The terms included: independence for the United Provinces and for Switzerland. Germany, so devastated, remained disunited. There was popular displeasure in France that the terms did not include peace between France and Spain.   


VII i. (197-198) Introduction: Antecedants: After Henry IV's death there were several years of disorder.
ii. (198-202) Richelieu's Arrival To Power: Born in 1585, from 1625 until his death in 1642, Richelieu sought to establish the king and France, internally and externally. The nation of France emerges through his ardent efforts. He opposed the Hapsburgs and allied himself with the Protestants.
iii. (202-205) The Valtelline: This Swiss territory linked Austria with Spanish controlled Milan. Richelieu had it seized, but the Hapsburgs retook it.
iv. (205-213) Internal Troubles: The Nobility and the Huguenots: Richelieu acted both internally and externally to strengthen the French crown. Despite Spanish aid, the Huguenots were bested and sued for peace. The Treaty of Barcelona (May 10, 1626) made peace between France and Spain. Plots against Richelieu failed. Richelieu's suggestion of a standing army of twenty thousand men and an effective navy was not opposed. Five thousand Englishmen came to support French Protestants at La Rochelle. They failed to take Fort St Martin nearby and returned home. La Rochelle finally surrendered. Louis XIII accepted Richelieu's moderate suggestion. La Rochelle's autonomy ended; the modern state triumphed. Protestants were defeated elsewhere.
v. (213-217) The Mantuan Succession: This was contended. Hapsburgs seized it. Louis XIII's mother opposed Richelieu. The King stated the Nation's priority on November 10, 1630. This may be seen as the birthday of the modern state.
vi. (217-220) Internal Administration: Richelieu perceived the state as the vehicle for making France great and prosperous. He realized the importance of the army and navy. He established these through substantial financial deficits.
vii. (220-222) Richelieu and the Thirty Years' War: First, Richelieu had Sweden active in the war, then France directly engaged. Richelieu sought to separate Spain from the Empire. His success in this is evident in the Treaty of Westphalia, sugned after his death.
viii. (222-225) War With Spain: In 1636 Spanish forces pushed deep into France from the north. National response provided men and money. France pushed back. Ferdinand II died on February 15, 1637, Pere Joseph, Richelieu's mentor and friend, on December 18, 1638.
ix. (225-229) The Decline of Spain: Spain's Philip IV had Olivarez as his capable minister striving against feudal estates towards an absolute state. This was a time of Spanish piety and devotion, of many new monasteries, but also of the Inquisition. It was a golden cultural period. Riclelieu's persistence forced strong continued presence externally leading to internal rebellions in Portugual and Catalonia. In December 1640, the Duke of Braganza became king of an independent Portugual. The Catalan rebellion led to Olivarez's dismissal on January 17, 1643. He died two years later.
x. (229-231) Richelieu's Last Years: French successes continued. In 1639 Dutch ships destroyed Spanish sea power. Imperial forces took significant losses in Germany. On September 5, 1638 Louis XIV was born. Richelieu died on December 4, 1642, Louis XIII on May 14, 1643. 
xi. (231-235) Mazarin--Successor: Richelieu's last act was to secure Mazarin (born in Naples in 1602) as his successor. Mazarin had the full support of the Queen Regent, Anne of Austria. There was intrigue, but Mazarin had full control by September 1643. Pope Urban VIII died on July 29, 1644. His successor, Innocent X, was hostile to France, though rather incompetent. Mazarin had able military leaders. France achieved successes against Spain in the north, but this worried the Dutch. Victories also occurred in Italy, Spain and at sea. Mazarin failed to achieve peace with Spain. Spain made gains on the field and diplomatically.
xii. (235-242) The Fronde and After: Besides the Parlement of Paris, France had seven provincial parliaments. Paris voiced the suffering of the heavily taxed lower classes. The financial situation was so bad, that France had started to tax even those able to pay. French nobles, great lords, had their own armed forces. They joined together and rebelled. The rebellion had many twists and turns. Young Louis XIV appeared, gaining public support. Mazarin fled on February 6, 1651 and returned on September 5, 1651. Spain scored successes. Mazarin entered Paris escorted by Louis XIV on February 3, 1653. 
xiii. (242-245) Conclusion: The Peace of the Pyrenees and Mazarin's End: Negotiations began in 1658. Louis XIV, in love with Mazarin's niece, Marie Mancini, was pressured to marry the Spanish Infanta, Maria Theresa. Peace negotiations proceeded and borders were drawn. France was now the strongest country in Europe. The peace and the two weddings (one in Spain, one in France) occurred in June 1660. Later that year a separate treaty (Oliva) brought peace to the North. Mazarin passed away on March 9, 1661. He with Richelieu was midwife of the modern state.

VIII i. (246-248) The General Setting: Dynastic Politics: Perception was dynastic, rather than state. Background included significant Turkish presence and threat.
ii. (248-252) The Beginnings of the Romanovs: Michael Romanov (rgn. 1613-1645), grand nephew of Ivan the Terrible, and his son Alexis (rgn. 1645-1676) ruled during the period covered by this volume. The estates had more influence than at other times. Serfdom developed. Russia at this time was remote from European currents. Russia fought with Sweden, Poland and the Turks. Cossacks roved south and west, along the Don, the Ural and the Dneiper. They took Azov and offered it to Tsar Michael, though the strength of the Turkish response led him to decline the offer. Cossacks helped break Poland's control of the Ukraine, which joined Russia, i.e. acknowledged Tsar Alexis.
iii. (252-257) Poland: Poland was the extreme of autocratic feudalism. King Wladyslaw held a conference in 1644 to compose religious diferences. It failed. There was tolerance and Poland received refugeees. Poland's kings had little power against entrenched nobles. Towards the end of the period much of the country was occupied by foreigners. The heroic defence of the monastery of Czenstochowa, site of the icon of the Black Madonna, re-energized the nation. Yet, the weakeness of the Polish monarchy boded ill for the future.
iv. (257-261) The Struggle For The Baltic: Sweden: Sweden during this period under Gustavus Adolphus took control of the Baltic, becoming a modern state, with the Dutch teaching much re capitalism, mining, naval technology, etc. Gustavus Adolphus and his chancellor, Oxenstierna, had popular support. Sweden expanded through military success, took and lost a large part of Poland, defeated Denmark. 
v. (261-266) The Great Elector and Brandenburg: The Hohenzollern Dynasty, Brandenburg electors, inherited Prussia in 1618. Frederick William ascended the throne in 1640 at the age of twenty, bringing energy and intelligence to Brandenburg's rule. He established a permanent Prussian army in 1655, initially a deensive force. He sought to strengthen central, monarchical authority, conceding feudal lords' rights to hold peasants as serfs. He was tolerant in religion. Although Prussia was a fief of Poland, Frederick William supported Sweden, then, through the Treaty of Oliva, was recognized as sovereign and a rising balance to Sweden and Poland. 
vi. (266-268) Hapsburg and Hungary: The Hapsburgs were also kings of Hungary. This drew them into Eastern affairs. They controlled the northern and western parts. The lands controlled by Bethlen Gabor (rgn. 1613-1629) and George Rakoczy I (1630-1648) were largely independent. Peter Pazmany, a Jesuit, became Archbishop in 1616. By his death in 1637, he had brought a majority back to Catholicism. George Rakoczy II failed in trying to seize the Polish crown by force. The Turks advanced.
vii. (268-271) The Eastern and the Western Church and the Great Schism: In Russia Patriarch Nikon (b. 1605, d. 1681) attempted reforms that led to the emergence of Old Believers. The Orthodox Church strongly supported secular authority. When Nikon tried to assert equal power to Tsar Alexis, he faced resistance. He resigned and was confined. Orthodox and Old Believers clashed violently. Both asserted Russian nationalism, and objected to Western, Latin influence.

IX i. (272-275) The Beginnings of Charles's Reign: While in France Richelieu had a monarchist, authoritative state emerge; in England constitutional, etc. limits on monarchy occurred. Charles, a young man of exceptional virtue, inhereited a realm lowly esteemed abroad and seething internally. The treasury was empty. He called Parliament, stressing the need for war against Spain. Charles felt the prevailing European vigor of authoritative monarchy, missing England's Parliamentary vigor.
ii. (275-278) Parliament and King, 1625-1629: The members of Parliament were of high quality and eager to serve the realm. They sought balance between King and Parliament. Parliament held the right to person and property, no taxation without the approval of Parliament. The King's friend and minister Buckingham was assassinated in 1628. Charles dissolved Parliament and resolved to follow the example of Louis XIII and reign without it.
iii. (278-286) Charles' Personal Government, 1629-1640: Friedrich favors Parliament and writes unfavorably of the King for failing to take nationalist sensitivities into account. Charles was forced to innovate legal ways to raise revenue. Friedrich faults Archbishop Laud for seeking ritual conformity. He criticizes Laud for backing the King over Parliament. Thomas Wentworth had the same flaw. When Laud became Archbishop in 1633, Pope Urban VIII offered him a Cardinal's hat. Serious revolutionary ferment began in 1637. Charles attempted force against Scottish resistance. He lost. In 1640 he summoned Parliament, which immediately arrested Wentworth.
iv. (286-288) New England: Puritan Commonwealth: Many Puritans crossed the Atlantic, founding the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and there first presenting democratic government, including secret ballot elections.
v. (289-293) Eve and Beginning of the Great Rebellion: The Long Parliament lasted from November 1640 to December 6, 1648. Thomas Wentworth was executed on May 12, 1641. It began dismantling autocratic government. Oppression renewed in Ireland provoking rebellion. The King visited Scotland. Parliament passed the Grand Remonstrance. Charles agreed to supremacy of the Church of England and suppression of Catholicism. He declared exclusion of bishops from Parliament and Parliamentary appointment of royal councillors unconstitutional.
vi. (294-300) The Civil Wars, 1642-1648: Friedrich writes that the English Civil War was a religious war. Religious fervor boosted, writes Friedrich, the morale of those fighting against the King. Then initial victories boosted the numbers of the more religious fighters. Possibly it was more religious on one side, the winners, than on the other. There was dissention within the ranks of those on both sides. Ecclesiastical authority was a major issue that eventually cost anti-royalist forces Presbyterian support. Charles's forces were soundly defeated at Naseby on June 14, 1645. Further defeat followed and Charles surrendered on May 5, 1646.
vii. (300-303) The Revolution, 1647-1649: Revolutions generally become more radical and this English one fit the pattern. Two major proposals were a stronger base and greater regularity for Parliament and religious freedom. Parliament, forcefully purged of its less zealous members, tried and condemned King Charles. 
viii. (303-311) The Commonwealth Free: The King's execution caused indignation and controversy that has not subsided. Rights were asserted by the voters, including religious freedom, but only for Christians, excluding Catholics. In 1649, Cromwell confronted an Irish rising and suppressed it. In 1650, he defeated the Scots. While Cromwell did not take the title of King, he retained final say. The Commonwealth became the Protectorate. The navy was strengthened. Holland supported England's royalists. England prevailed in a naval conflict, capturing more than fourteen hundred Dutch ships. Peace was signed on April 5, 1654 in England's favor. On April 20, 1653, Cromwell used military might to dissolve Parliament.
ix. (311-318) The Protectorate: Cromwell became Protector. A tightly restricted electorate chose a Parliament, which Cromwell dissolved when it also displeased him. Nationalism, even imperialism, flowered. Soon after peace with Holland, war broke out with Spain. Cromwell failed to stabilize England's finances.
x. (319-323) The United Netherlands: Maurice of Nassau passed away, while Spain's Spinola was threatening the key fortress of Breda. Maurice's brother, Frederick Henry of Orange (1584-1647), became Stadholder. Breda fell, but with Richelieu's financial support, Frederick Henry was able to score other Dutch successes. Spain's defeats on land and on sea raised fears of a French threat. Overseas, Holland replaced Portugual in Indonesia and in part of Brazil. Frederick Henry's son, William II, succeeded him, but died of smallpox in 1649. His son was not yet born. Jan de Witt was chosen to lead. He secured peace with England, attended to putting Dutch finances in order, etc.
xi. (323-326) Collapse of the Protectorate and Restoration of the Monarchy: As usual, repression stirred opposition. Friedrich states his assessment of Cromwell as the greatest political figure of the period 1610-1660. Cromwell's son could not stem the Protectorate's collapse. Parliament invited Charles II to rule. He came.

It's perhaps unfortunate that I'm writing this on the same day that I finished my first reading of the book. It means his last chapter is the freshest thing in my mind, and I found that somewhat disquieting. What bothered me about it was his seemingly involved and biased pro Protestant depiction of the reign of Charkes I and the supremecy of Cromwell. He does come out and state his feeling that Cromwell was, "The greatest political figure of the two generations between 1610 and 1660." (p. 324) I have a less fresh impression of his treatment of other aspects or areas also being unbalanced. He does mention economics. I seem to recall that he credits Hobbes with founding psychology. And possibly with a straight face he writes: "Hobbes identifies himself with mankind--not an uncommon failing amongst philosophers." (p. 29)

Another lingering impression I have of Carl Friedrich is that he is adept at presenting a large amount of very varied material concisely and interestingly. I may twitch in places when I feel the historian is coming across as a partisan. However, he is providing material that keeps me reading.
