The light of night is full I see.
It shines on mine; it shines on thine.
The tide of time, the winds that whine
Have borne and blown and where are we?

I'm naught, alone, an ant, unknown.
The seeds I've sown the breeze has blown.
It seems all dreams ablur that were,
The deeds I yearned, the world's astir.

A song to long an age ago,
And eyes too wise to surely know
The wide inside and heats apart.
I tried, you know, for peace to start.

The years appear and roaring war
Denies our tries and gore is more
In sight than hope of strifeless life.
Can gropers cope with rifles rife?

What rules in schools, what dawns upon
A smiling child and songs now gone?
A mind, a find upstream aways
Today's awaste in bullets' blaze.

A youth's a pearl, a future prize,
A rose to come, a sun to rise,
To lighten night, to gladden man.
I failed, as all, since time began.

No hour of grace, no day of peace.
We need the spring and man's release,
A task too vast for lowly men,
a work above a mortal's ken.

I'm told the golden orb's aglow,
Divine the rays of day to stream.
Before too long the globe will dream.
Tonight too late for you to know.

Michael Mckenny October 21-23, 1983

Occasioned by the murder of a fellow student from St. Patrick's
College in the recent coup Wednesday in Grenada.
