THE SCHOLARS (Ju-lin Wai-shih, The Unofficial History of the
Literati), Wu Ching Tzu (1701-1754), transl. Yang Hsien-yi and
Gladys Yang, Foreign Languages Press, Peking, 1973 (1957)

The following detailed plot outline of this very evocative portrayal
of life in Ming scholarly society can barely begin to hint at the
exquisite beauty of the complete novel. A host of realistic people
move through the pages of this book, too simplistically described as
a satire of the official life that forms a background to the poetic,
scholarly culture it unrolls scene by scene, like a scroll painting.

Chapter One (pp. 1-14): Ideal, unworldly Wang Mien, reads and paints
in his village, unimpressed by the attention of the influential. He
leaves home and goes to the city, rather than meet with the local
magistrate. Despite the popularity of his paintings, he takes the
flooding of the Yellow River as an omen and returns home. There he
spends six years dutifully taking care of his dying mother who has
him swear he'll marry and have children, but not become an official.
In the upheaval at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, Chu Yuan-chang seeks
out Wang Mien who advises Chu to triumph by justice and honesty, not
force. Later when Chu is the first Ming emperor, he appoints Wang
Mien to a high position. Wang Mien has already become a hermit,
anticipating such an imperial move.

Chapter Two (pp. 15-25): In 1487 in a Kuan-yin temple lantern dances
for the festival on the fifteenth day of the first month are planned
and the hiring of a teacher, Chou Chin, old without passing the
prefectural examination. He dines with a young local scholar, Mei
Chiu, and recounts a dream. The boys are unruly at school. After a
few months, the teacher meets Wang Hui, a provincial scholar coming
back from visiting the graves of his ancestors. He is startled on
seeing the name of a young pupil, Hsun Mei, as he's dreamed of that
name being with his on a list of graduates. The teacher is dismissed
after a year, because he doesn't flatter those who seek flattering.
He goes to the provincial capital with his brother-in-law and some
other merchants. While there they look at the examination hall and
Chu Chin falls unconscious.

Chapter Three (pp. 26-39): The merchants calm sobbing Chou Chin and
offer him money to pay to take the examination. He is very grateful.
He passes and his star rises. In three years he is commissioner of
education in Kwangtung province. There he supervises examinations
and is surprised with one paper he reads thrice before realizing how
remarkably good it is. The paper's author, Fan Chin, passes the
provincial examination, and briefly becomes crazy in the excitement
of the good news. On regaining his senses, he is visited by a local
notable who presents him with money and offers him a more spacious
residence. Other presents come from various admirers. Fan Chin's old
mother is told all this is really their's and falls unconscious.

Chapter Four (pp. 40-51): There's the death and funeral ceremonies
of Fan's mother. Fan accompanies Chang to borrow money from Fan's
patron. Fan and Chang meet Senior Licentiate Yen. The issue of the
ownership of a pig calls Yen home. The magistrate arrives, invites
Fan and Chang to eat, is impressed by Fan's strict mourning, and is
called aside to be offered a bribe from Moslems who wish to keep
selling beef against the law. The magistrate, also a Moslem, takes
Chang's advice to refuse the bribe and punish the one offering it.
The man dies and several hundred Moslems go in protest to the yamen.

Chapter Five (pp. 52-63): Chang and Fan are lowered down the wall.
The mob is calmed. The magistrate reports to his superior. The five
ringleaders of the protest are arrested. Two cases concerning Yen
are heard by Magistrate Tang. Yen, in the wrong, flees. His brother
and his brother's brothers-in-law make arrangements to satisfy both
plaintiffs and yamen officials. The brother's wife becomes ill. The
doctors fail. She childless agrees to the concubine's pleas and
tells her husband to marry the concubine, so the concubine's son can
be heir and not fall victim to another wife. The wedding occurs. The
first wife dies. A cat reveals some money she'd saved. This is given
to her two brothers as they leave to write the provincial exam. Her
husband falls ill. As he lies dying, he holds up two fingers. Only
the new wife understands.

Chapter Six (pp. 64-74): The new wife says her dying husband's wish
is to remove one of two wicks to save oil. He dies content. The
widow's son catches smallpox. After his death, she offers to adopt
Yen's fifth son. A letter is sent to Yen. This arrives as Yen's
second son is marrying the second daughter of Commissioner Chou. Yen
hasn't offerred enough money for musicians. Only one flutist and one
drummer who can't play in harmony turn up. He does better several
days later for a procession to a boat. On the voyage's last day, Yen
complains of illness, eats some walnut wafers, leaves the rest of
the wafers out where they are seen and eaten by the helmsman. Yen
then claims this is expensive medicine, and refuses to pay for the
trip. Yen then tries to place his son and son's bride in the room of
Yen's brother's widow. The magistrate and prefect support the rights
of the widow.

Chapter Seven (pp. 75-86): Yen appeals. He goes to Vice President
Chou's. Fan Chin also arrives and is made education commissioner in
Shantung. His patron asks him to keep an eye open for Hsun Mei. As
he does so, the name Su Shih (Su Tung-p'o) is mentioned, but he does
not know it. He finds Hsun Mei and congratulates him for doing well.
He chastizes Mei Chiu for Mei's unconventional essays. Hsun Mei and
Mei Chiu feast in their village. The next year Hsun Mei does well in
the provincial examination. He meets Wang Hui. They visit a fortune
teller. Hsun's given the fortune, "Stop!" His mother dies. He seeks,
in vain, to evade the three year mourning period.

caretaker of the ancestral graveyard. The caretaker's daughter, now
a widow, has asked her parents and brother to stay with her. The two

thought. They ask him where he heard it. He says from Yang, manager
of a salt shop, now in jail for debt. They promise to try to help
him. When they arrive home, they instruct a steward to pay the debt.
The steward pockets the money and secures Yang's release on the
strength of the Lou name. The Lous, unaware Yang doesn't know that
they helped him, are surprised he doesn't come to thank them. After

do see a sample of his poetry which impresses them.

Chu. The fortune teller's already cast their auspicious horoscopes.
Chu's grandfather approves the match. The traditional ceremonies
occur. There is a truly splendid wedding procession, as Chu and all
proceed to the bride's, an only child's, house where he is to live.

groom's soup, and later a cook's shoe smashes into two plates of
food at the groom's table and more soup is spilled.

Hsien-fu's new wife. She is surprised to learn her husband is more

This book is very well illustrated and it has an appendix explaining
official terms. Although this plot outline is to remind me of some
specific happenings, a menu is a poor substitute for a tasty feast.
The superb novel itself is most highly recommended.
