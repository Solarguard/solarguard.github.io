Friend,

We cannot protect our freedoms by sacrificing them.

We all agree that terrorism is a real threat - but we don't have to 
give up our hard won freedoms to be secure. That's a false choice 
created by Stephen Harper and his politics of fear.

More and more Canadians are united in opposition to Bill C-51, and 
I'd like you to add your name today:

We can replace the politics of fear with the politics of hope and 
optimism.

Thanks,

Tom

Hello, Tom.

Thanks for your message. I think strategically you'd do better 
to express yourself so that no future terrorist attack would 
drain any of your potential support. One example would be to 
assert that you'd like to empower our security professionals to 
focus on pressing security threats, without having their 
attention diluted by including Canadians' non violent dissent, 
etc., capable of being handled by general law enforcement.

Very Best Wishes,

Michael

Dear Tom,

Many thanks for the invitations I've been receiving inviting me 
to sign petitions to Stephen Harper, especially the one concerning 
the security enhancement bill. I do not believe that signing 
petitions to Stephen Harper will serve the petitions' stated purposes. 
I believe that Stephen Harper has already calculated that even if a 
majority of Canadians oppose him on these points, Canada's electoral 
system enables his re-election. Whatever purpose petitions serve in 
helping you identify your base, in my opinion they can also distract 
capable leaders from actually achieving things that could be 
accomplished regardless of the priorities of Stephen Harper.

I specifically address your attention to the 1883 visionary work "The 
Dominion in 1983" by Ralph Centennius, a description of Canada in many 
ways superior to what has actually so far been attained. The Victorian 
author depicts the country's patriotic and philanthropic citizens 
going ahead and doing what needs doing. They have paid down the debt, 
developed the North and created a high tech nation attracting 
engineers and scientists to observe and study Canada's accomplishments.

I think Canadians owe you that altruistic patriotism portrayed by Ralph 
Centennius. I think you can do your part by considering, in addition 
to the practical politics you assess as optimum, such personal examples 
as vacationing within Canada and purchasing more and more Canadian 
products; as contributing to a growing awareness that our society has 
structural unemployment, whose victims could be reassured as to their 
value and invited to join (even unpaid) in nation building projects, for 
example computer research, including locating ideal places for the low 
cost housing Canada can use some of this enabling the country to expand 
more into its interior) and helping in its construction; as using your 
undoubted organizational skills to bring together, inexpensively or as 
donations, the land, workers and materials to provide adequate housing 
for those inhabiting the second largest country in the world.

Thanks again for your invitation to sign petitions. I have preferred to 
take several hours to respond in what I think is a more productive way. 
I hope you will draw from Ralph Centennius' vision what is overdue for 
the Canadian nation.

Very Best Wishes,

Michael
