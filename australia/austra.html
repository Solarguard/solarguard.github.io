ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE DREAMTIME, Josephine Flood, Yale, 1990 (1983).

This is a fascinating survey of Australian Aboriginal archaeology. It
includes traditional oral accounts, which seem to recall distant events
confirmed by modern geological and archaeological research. In the preface
(pp. 9-11), the author introduces the topic, refers to previous work and
states:

   There are two sources of knowledge about the really distant past of
   Australia: archaeological evidence and Aboriginal oral traditions passed
   down as stories about the Dreamtime. The Dreamtime is the era of
   creation, the time of the great Spirit Ancestors, who have profoundly
   influenced the traditional pattern of life as Aborigines know it today.
   The myths tell the story of human origins in Australia, of which much
   has been substantiated by scientific investigation. Oral traditions
   about events that took place many thousands of years ago have endured:
   the eruption of volcanoes, the rising of the seas and the change from
   lush vegetation to desert in the heart of Australia. p. 9  

The first chapter, "Documents of Stone and Bone" (pp. 15-28), presents a
description of the aim of archaeology and a definition of culture:

   What archaeologists try to do is to discover the pattern of past
   culture history, past life-styles, and the presence of culture change.
   Culture is the distinctive and complex system developed by a group of
   human beings to adapt to their environment. It includes ways of getting
   food, social organization, religion, artefacts, dwellings and the like.
   And because the environment is always changing, in small or large ways,
   so too culture is continually adapting and changing. p. 15

The chapter mentions that the pertinent time frame is more than 40,000
years and while stone is more likely to endure, ten thousand year old
wooden boomerangs have been uncovered. It states that palaeontologists and
palaeobotanists join with physicists and chemists to assist in the
analysis of archaeological artefacts and sites. It provides a closer look
at a specific excavation with a several page portrayal of Josephine
Flood's discovery of Cloggs Cave in eastern Victoria and the patient dig
that found human occupation there from some 17,000 years ago to 8,500
years ago.

Chapter Two, "The First Boat People" (pp. 29-39), considers the arrival of
the Aborigines by sea to Australia. It mentions Aboriginal legends, the
extent of exposed land during the Ice Age and the various routes which may
have been used. It refers to the Huon Terraces in New Guinea, an island
once joined with Australia:

   The terraces rise like a giant flight of steps out of the sea: each
   'tread' is an ancient coral reef now raised up high above modern sea
   level. The massive earth movements, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
   to which New Guinea is subject have raised the coral reef formed at the
   shoreline 120 000 years ago to 400 metres above sea level. On one of the
   lower terraces 80 metres above sea level, twenty-four weathered axes 
   were found...One of these extremely weathered stone axes was found with 
   some other stone tools under two metres of volcanic ash in a layer dated
   to about 40 000 years ago...This makes it the earliest hafted stone axe
   in the world. pp. 38-39

Chapter Three, "Life and Death at Lake Mungo" (pp. 40-52), mentions the
environment into which the incoming humans moved.

   In addition, a number of giant animals and birds (megafauna), which are
   now extinct, existed over much of Australia until the last phase of the
   ice age, which ended some 10 000 years ago. These included huge
   flightless birds and giant animals, such as a donkey-sized wombat, 
   kangaroos 3 metres tall, and the marsupial Diprotodon, which was the
   size of a rhinoceros. p. 40 

   The now dry bed of Lake Mungo would have been 20 kilometres long and 10
   wide with a depth of some 15 metres. On its eastern side sand dunes
   provided sheltered campsites by the lake shore. pp. 41-42

The chapter considers human remains, some 26,000 years old providing
evidence for cremation at the time.

   The presence of pellets of red ochre suggest the use of this pigment
   for ritual, art or decoration, and another nearby site has shown that 
   ochre was used in funerary rites 30 000 years ago. This in the site of
   another burial, but this time of a male, who was not cremated but placed
   in a grave with his body thickly coated with red ochre. This Mungo III
   burial was discovered 500 metres east of the Mungo I cremation site 
   (figure 3.34). (The name Mungo II was reserved for some very
   fragmentary, burnt human remains at the Mungo I site.) p. 45

   In fact, at Mungo red pigment was in use even earlier, for lumps of
   ochre and stone artefacts were found deep below the ashes of a fire lit
   32 000 years ago. As the ochre did not occur naturally at Mungo, it
   must have been deliberately carried there from some distance away. 
   Similar lumps of pigment, some of them showing signs of use, have been
   found in Pleistocene levels in other widely separated sites, such as
   Keniff Cave in Queensland, Cloggs Cave in Victoria, Miriwun in Western
   Australia, and several Arnhem Land rockshelters. Ochre has no
   utilitarian functions, such as medicinal use; it is simply a pigment
   used (at least in the recent past) to decorate rock walls, artefacts,
   dancers' bodies in ceremonies, and corpses during burial rites. Its
   use in burial ritual is the only use documented so far in ice age
   sites, but then as now ochre was probably used for other purposes. p. 46

The chapter mentions two cooking methods, hearths of open fires and ovens
with cooking stones, and the evidence Mungo fireplaces provides for polar
magnetism. It tells of bone (only three) and rock tools from Mungo sites,
of the water and land creatures which furnished food for humans, of the
adaptation to grass seed when changing environment forced a change of diet.

Chapter Four, "The Robust and the Gracile" (pp. 55-66), looks at skulls
found, since the Talgai one in southern Queensland in 1886.

   All Australian skulls so far found belong to the youngest form of the
   human race, Homo sapiens sapiens, but the fossil skulls tend to divide
   into two groups: robust and gracile...Everywhere in the world the
   robust, rugged thick-boned type of physique is earlier than the lightly 
   built form. p. 55

It proceeds to the large Cohuna skull and, "The remains of at least forty
individuals," (p. 59) from Kow Swamp, buried, in at least one case
cremated, from fifteen to nine millennia ago.

   This burial complex at present is the largest single population of the
   late Pleistocene epoch found in one locality anywhere in the world...
   Grave goods were found with several of the Kow Swamp burials. These
   were ochre, shells, marsupial teeth and quartz artefacts, and one body
   was laid to rest on a bed of mussel shells. As at Mungo 20 000 years
   earlier, ochre was powdered over a corpse, which shows the long
   continuity of such customs. p. 61

The chapter continues with references to bands or necklaces of teeth
(kangaroo and Tasmanian devil), the Nitchie skull missing two teeth,
suggesting a feature of recent initiation rites dates from at least 6,500
years, Cossack man, also missing a tooth and confirming the presence of
the robust group in Western Australia.

Chapter Five, "The Origin of the First Australians" (pp. 67-74), begins by
considering W.L.H. 50 (Willandra Lakes Hominid 50) and various theories
concerning the existence of robust and gracile Aborigines. Genetic
research is mentioned and the interpretation this allows.

   The family tree produced suggests that Australian Aborigines are a mixed
   and varied population, deriving from the hybridization of two lineages.
   The split and the mixing of the two lineages may have occurred in Asia
   and South-East Asia, from where an already mixed population entered
   Australia at a much later time. The two distinct lineages seen in the
   mitochrondial DNA of Aborigines may well correlate with the two
   distinct physiques found in the fossil skeletons: the robust and the
   gracile, and indicate that the split between them goes back a long way.
   p. 72

The chapter also mentions and rejects the interpretation that Homo sapiens
originated in Australia. It refers to other gracile remains from such
sites as Chou-k'ou-tien (Zhoukoudian) in China, Niah Cave in Sarawak,
Tabon Cave in Palawan, the Philippines and Wajak in Java. It concludes by
suggesting two migrations, of robust people some 70,000 years ago and of
gracile people some 15,000 to 20,000 years later.

Chapter Six, "The Peopling of Australia" (pp. 77-83), mentions the
theories of Joseph Birdsell (relatively rapid and diffusion inland quicker
than around the coast), of Sandra Bowder (coastal and upriver), and of
David Horton (having occupied much of the continent, people fell back to
the coast, thence to reoccupy the interior after 12,000 years ago). This
last theory seems disproved by evidence for continuous occupation of the
interior from at least 22,000 years ago.

   One of the basic problems in the search for traces of the earliest
   colonists is that the earliest sites will now be underneath the sea.
   The earliest campsites were drowned by the rising post-glacial seas,
   and not until the people had gradually moved a hundred or more
   kilometres inland, to what is now the coastline of northern Australia,
   would any trace of these first migrants remain. pp. 79-80

The chapter proceeds to examine finds in Cape York,

   One of the most likely points for migrants arriving on the Pleistocene
   land bridge between Australia and New Guinea. p. 80

Cape York sites, some with engravings and paintings, include: Mushroom
Rock, the Early Man Shelter, the Split Rock Galleries, Green Ant Rock
Shelter, Walkunder Arch Cave and Colless Creek Shelter. The author
mentions the finding of bone at Early Man, Walkunder and Colless Creek.   
   
   In most sandstone shelters bone is only preserved in the upper levels
   and has disintegrated completely after a few hundred years in the
   ground. And in tropical Australia termites, which build their mounds
   against trees or rock walls, eat up any bone or other organic material
   very rapidly. p. 81

Colless Creek would seem to have been occupied more than 30,000 years ago.

Chapter Seven, "Arnhem Land and the West" (pp. 84-94) considers the
ancient Arnhem Land River area and such sites as Nawamoyn, Malangangerr,
Malakunanja II and Nauwalabila (Lindner). These sites provide evidence for
early ground-edged hafted axes. Mentioning how sites in the area have been
excavated and future expectations, Josephine Flood moves on to sites in
the Kimberley area, the extreme north of Western Australia. She mentions
the two fascinating Australite (tektite) flakes, one of which is Indochina
tektite, the only such hitherto found in Australia and thus possibly of
Ice Age Asian origin.

Next she mentions early sites at Mount Newman and along the Greenough and
Murchison Rivers, as well as Devil's Lair, "20 kilometres north of Cape
Leeuwin," (p. 89) and Upper Swan River.

   Even more important than the stone tools at Devil's Lair are those of
   bone, since bone and bone tools are preserved in so few Pleistocene  
   sites. Those from Devil's Lair are at present Australia's oldest bone 
   tools: the earliest is estimated to be 29 500 years old. p. 91

Also at Devil's Lair were found three bone beads some 12,000 to 15,000
years old.

   The Devil's Lair beads are so far unique in Aboriginal culture and are
   the oldest known ornaments in Australia. p. 91

Chapter Eight, "The East Coast in the Pleistocene" (pp. 95-106) begins
with Kenniff's Cave, southern Queensland, occupied from about 19,000 years
ago.

   The importance of the Kenniff Cave cultural sequence is threefold.
   Firstly, it has an unusually wide range of artefacts and contains a
   small but representative sample of most of the major Australian
   prehistoric tool types, including all the small composite tools.
   Secondly, occupation extended over an extremely long time, from the
   present back into the Pleistocene. Thirdly, and most importantly, it
   was the site that provided the basis for the recognition of an earlier
   and a later technological phase in Australian prehistory. p. 97

The chapter proceeds to look at the Burrill Lake rockshelter, Bass Point,
Wallen Wallen Creek, Cranebrook Terrace and Lake George. At this last
palynology (pollen analysis) indicates:

   Almost 120 000 years ago, there was a large increase in the amount of
   charcoal in the sediment, indicating a much higher incidence of fires
   than before, although the last interglacial was no drier than the 
   preceding two had been. At the same time there was a reduction in the
   number of fire-sensitive species and the first expansion of fire-
   tolerant, Eucalyptus-dominated vegetation in the 350 000 years of
   vegetation history represented by the upper part of the core...The 
   Aborigines used fire not only for cooking but also as a hunting weapon,
   igniting the bush both to drive out game and to make fresh new grass
   spring up to attract browsing animals. p. 102

While the palynologist Gurdip Singh thinks this suggests human presence in
Australia then, archaeologist Josephine Flood thinks further confirmation
is required for such a significant modification of the understanding of
Australian prehistory.

Chapter Nine, "An Ice Age Walk To Tasmania" (pp. 107-120), describes sites
at Cave Bay on Hunter Island, Kutikina Cave on the Lower Franklin River
and caves such as Nanwoon, Bone Cave and Bluff Cave in the Southern Forest.
Kutikina is of special interest for its Darwin glass tools.

   Darwin glass is a true glass which was formed when a meteorite crashed
   into the earth. The high energy collision melted the rocks around the
   collision point forming glass. Small seams of these contorted glass
   'impactites' occur around the meteorite crater, which is some 25 
   kilometres north-west of Kutikiner Cave and was only discovered by
   geologists twenty years ago. The Aborigines, however, for thousands of
   years, selected the glass, collected it in bags, and carried it back to
   their cave for manufacture into sharp cutting tools. p. 112

Some Tasmanian sites contain stencils from red ochre paste of comparable
date to such in European caves.

Chapter Ten, "Karta: Island of the Dead" (pp. 121-130), considers Kangaroo
Island, uninhabited when Captain Flinders arrived in 1802 and, it seems,
for at least the past 2,500 years. The Seton Cave ahows occupation from
16,000 years ago, intensive occupation beginning some 11,000 years ago and
either a relict population or visitors (the navagational challenge cause
archaeologists to favour the relict population) after the sea level rose.
The chapter also considers the heavy Kartan tools.

   Kartan sites have been found on the mainland on the Fleuries, Yorke and
   Eyre Peninsulas...the only reasonable explanation for the absence of
   Kartan tools from the 16 000-year-old Seton site is that they pre-date
   it, and their similar absence from younger sites and post-glacial 
   coastal dunes also indicates Pleistocene antiquity. p. 130

Chapter Eleven, "Art and Technology" (pp. 131-156), is a fascinating look
at petroglyphs in such places as Red Gorge and Devon Downs in South
Australia, Cleland Hills and Ingaladdi in the Northern Territory and the
Early Man Shelter in northern Queensland.

   One possible indication of antiquity for these South Australian pecked
   engravings is that amongst the thousands of animal tracks there is not
   one representation of dingo tracks. This suggests that these engravings
   pre-date the arrival of the dingo in Australia. p. 133

More recent engravings in Tasmania also exclude the dingo, which came to
Australia after Tasmania was separated. Flood considers the Mount Cameron
West engravings impressive. The cation-ratio dating method ("New and
somewhat controvertial" p. 138) provides c. 31,500 years ago for the age
of the earliest petroglyphs in Olary, South Australia.

   Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory...contains the most complex and
   prolific rock art not only in Australia but also in the world. There are
   thousands of painted rockshelters. The paintings are generally
   naturalistic, documenting the local environment, life-style and material
   culture. p. 139

There are four styles of rock paintings: pre-estuarine (depicting,
"Extinct animals, such as the thylacine" p. 140 and with a, "Predominance
of land animals among the motifs." p. 140), eastuarine ("Dominated by fish
and crocodile, often portrayed in the polychrome X-ray style, in which the
spine or internal organs are shown as well as the exterior of a figure."
p. 140), fresh-water ("...A time when the salt plains became fresh-water
swamps covered with lotus flowers and surrounded by graceful paperbark
trees. This fresh-water phase is reflected in the appearance of goose wing
fans in the rock paintings." p. 140), and contact ("Mirroring contact with
Macassan fishermen from Indonesia and European settlers. Boats and ships,
horses and guns were then painted." p. 140).

Early paintings show extinct animals. Paintings show people in motion,
dancing or hunting.

Josephine Flood proceeds to discuss Koonalds Cave, a flint mine where  
in the dark was found the macaroni style similar to that found in European
cave art. She feels this would be of a ritual nature.

   In hunter-gatherer societies most art forms part of religious ritual,
   and this is certainly true of traditional Aboriginal society in more
   recent times. p. 149

The chapter continues with a look at tools, including the wooden ones
("A digging stick, pointed stakes...a short single spear, two barbed
spears, and nine boomerangs..." p. 151) found at Wyrie swamp.

Chapter Twelve, "Extinction of the Giant Marsupials" (pp. 157-170) begins
with a legend about giant kangaroos. It moves on to consider the issue of
human involvement in the extinction of these and other large animals, both
by hunting and by means of altering the habitat through burning. The issue
is not simple. It appears the Tasmanian devil and the Tasmanian tiger may
have been victims of the dingo. Lancefield Swamp may evidence increased
aridity. As to burning:

   Traditionally, small areas are burnt at intervals to clear the way for
   easier travel, as a hunting aid, and to promote the growth of new grass
   on which kangaroos and wallabies can feed. This regular, light, mosaic
   pattern of burning creates a varied array of habitats and conserves the
   modern macropod species, providing both good grazing and the shelter of
   unburnt areas, and lessening the occurrence of the disastrous blanket
   burns that often devastate parts of Australia nowadays. p. 168

Josephine Flood does note human agency in the extinction of such species
as the moa in New Zealand, the lemuroids in Madagascar and the dodo in
Mauritius and Reunion, and earlier (c. 50,000 years ago) of fifty African
big game species. Also:

   In America the first big-game hunters apparently swept through the
   continent from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego in only a thousand years,
   decimating the giant beasts and triggering changes that led to the
   extinction of mammoths, mastadons, ground sloths, horses, camels and
   twenty-six other families of megafauna. p. 169

Since megafauna faced extinction throughout Greater Australia and this
happened before the time of the principal climate change, humans were
likely responsible.

Chapter Thirteen, "Tasmania: Eight Thousand Years of Isolation" (pp. 173-
188) considers the effect of eight thousand years of separation from the
mainland. It mentions the development of smaller tools and the
disappearance of fish from the Tasmanian diet. Flood suggests climate
change may have led Tasmanians to prefer:

   High energy foods, such as seals and sea birds, and to abandon fish, an 
   item of less nutritional value that required considerably more energy
   and immersion in cold water to catch. p. 186

One historical point that Flood makes is that the Tasmanians were not
exterminated.

   Truganini was not 'the last Tasmanian'. Today there are some 2000
   descendants of those seal-hunting and muttonbirding Aborigines of Bass 
   Strait...It is to the white man's eternal shame that he tried to wipe
   out the Aborigines of Tasmania; it is to their credit that he
   failed. p. 188

Chapter Fourteen, "Rising Seas and Change" (pp. 189-195), mentions
Aboriginal legends dealing with this change which saw some people isolated
on new islands and mainland coastal tribes forced inland.

Chapter Fifteen, "Arrival of the Dingo" (pp. 196-209), raises the issue
of the possibly deliberate introduction of this animal from Asia at the
same time (around five thousand to six thousand years ago) as the
appearance of new small tools. These include what are presumed to be
spear points.

   They are small enough to have been arrow tips, such as those found so
   widely in North America, Asia and other parts of the world, but there
   is no evidence that the bow and arrow ever reached Australia. It was
   certainly not in use in Australia in the eighteenth century when
   Captain Cook arrived, whereas stone-tipped spears were still in use
   then in north-western Australia. p. 198

Other tools, such as backed blades, death spears (with rows of barbs) and
adze flakes, are mentioned, as well as distribution, cultural diversity
and the fascinating issue of origins. Flood states that previous dates
have been revised and that recent research suggests:

   The Australian dingo, far from being unique, is virtually
   indistinguishable from the wild dogs found throughout South and
   South-East Asia, which are all descended from the Indian wolf (Canis
   lupis pallibes). p. 205

She writes that the dingo was brought as a pet and adds the interesting
datum that the use of dogs as blankets survives in the expression, "Five
dog night." p. 205

She then considers language:

   About two hundred different languages were spoken in Aboriginal
   Australia at the time of European settlement...All but two or three
   Aboriginal languages have now been shown to be descended from one
   ancestral stock: proto-Australian...Only two languages show no links
   with other Australian languages: those of the Djingili of the Barkly
   Tableland and Tiwi of Bathurst and Melville Islands. pp. 206-207

She writes that proto-Australian is probably very ancient, likely the
original language of those entering Australia during the Ice Age.

Chapter Sixteen, "Harvesters, Engineers and Fire-Stick Farmers' (pp. 210-
225) focuses on sites in the Great Dividing Range. It mentions the efforts
undertaken to de-toxify Macrozamia nuts. These as well as the Bogong moth
(Agrotis infusa) seem to have supplied ritual gatherings such as
initiations. Another main food supply was an eel (Anguilla australis
occidentalis) a metre or more in length. Aborigines constructed eel traps,
stone houses and villages. Flood also considers coastal fishers and
repeats reasons for burning. She adds that Aborigines burnt the forest
floors with low intensity fires that preserved trees and actually reduced
the risk of major forest fires.

Chapter Seventeen, "The Question of Agriculture" (pp. 229-245) considers
why Aborigines did not develope nor adopt agriculture, notwithstanding its
early achievement in New Guinea. This, she posits, is because the
Aborigines, especially those in closest contact with foreigners, were so
affluent as hunter-gatherers there was no need to make the additional
effort. There are other factors, including the hostility of some
Aborigines to outsiders, making it difficult for new ideas to spread.
Sometimes there was peaceful interaction, though, and Flood refers to
travel on Indonesian praus between the island of Macassar and Australia
which saw some Aborigines travel to Macassar after 1700 CE.

She also explores the issue of the absence of the bow and arrow among
Aborigines.

   It seems that not only Cape York Aborigines but also the islanders
   regarded the mainland spears and spear-throwers as superior weapons for 
   fighting, hunting and fishing. The main items traded by Cape York
   Aborigines were spears, which were eagerly sought after in the western
   Torres Strait islands as far north as Mabuiag. Spear-throwers were also
   traded to the islands and were used in spear-fishing for dugong. p. 233

As to domesticating animals:

   There were no native marsupials suitable for domestication. None of the
   animals that were domesticated in other countries existed in Australia
   in prehistoric times; there were no pigs, cows, sheep, goats or chickens
   in Australia then. However, other native birds, such as geese, pelicans
   or scrub turkeys, might have been domesticated by a people so inclined.
   p. 235

She mentions the gathering of yams, fruit and millet, the storage of grass
seed, yams and water-lily tubers, as well as storage problems.

   Long-term preservation of many foods, however, presented serious
   problems. Indeed, the difficulties of food storage in the Australian
   environment may be of prime importance in understanding why food
   surpluses were not produced. The combination of high temperatures and
   pronounced seasonality of rainfall made food storage difficult in
   tropical Australia, not only for Aborigines but also for early European
   settlers. Early explorers, even with the benefit of salting and smoking
   techniques unknown to Aborigines, often found that the game they killed
   went bad within a few hours. p. 240

Chapter Eighteen, "The Last Thousand Years: Trade, Religion and Art" 
(pp. 246-258), mentions reciprocal gift-giving as a reason for trade.

   Not just artefacts were exchanged, but also raw materials such as ochre 
   and spinifex gum, myths, corroborees, dances and songs. There was
   little or no trade in food, but a roaring trade in native tobacco. 
   p. 247 
   
She mentions far reaching trade in the psychotropic pituri plant, in pearl
shell, axes and ochre and she devotes some attention to ochre mines.

   Red ochre was the most highly prized pigment in prehistoric Australia,
   and pieces from deposits created by ancestral spirits were essential
   for use in rituals. p. 250

As to religion:

   In a country with natural wonders such as Uluru, where every major
   topographical feature is endowed with mythological significance, it is
   not part of Aboriginal culture to build monuments such as megalithic
   tombs or pyramids...Natural landmarks are the centres of religion and
   ceremony. The places where Aboriginal people gather for the great
   ceremonies are not marked by formal structures -- the land is their
   cathedral. p. 251

She mentions lengthy rituals, totemism, drawings and rock art.

   The trunks of trees surrounding the ritual site were often carved, and
   ceremonial grounds are on record as being surrounded by from between
   six and a hundred and twenty trees carved with massive geometric
   designs. Carved trees, also called dendroglyphs, have designs carved
   into the wood, whereas a tree from which bark has simply been removed
   to make a container, shield, canoe, or other artefact is known as a
   scarred tree. p. 252

After several pages on rock art, she concludes with an epilogue 
(pp. 259-261) mentioning the dynamism of land and humans and summing up
questions such as when humans first arrived, their impact on the
megafauna, technological innovations and spiritual achievements. This is a
fascinating book well worth the read.
