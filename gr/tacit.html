Cornelius Tacitus

Cornelius Tacitus was born c. 56 and likely died some time after 117
C.E. He is probably the most highly regarded of historians writing
in Latin. There are three volumes of his work in the popular Penguin
translations: Annals, Histories, as well as the volume containing
Germania (a study of the Germans) and Agricola (a biography of his
father-in-law, a well known governor of Britain).

As usual with Classical historians, Tacitus is very concerned with
political and military happenings. His accounts cover early reigns
of the Roman Empire. The instability at the centre is underlined in
his relating the personal influences of such emperors as Caligula
and Nero, to say nothing of several Roman armies arriving in 69 C.E.
"The Year of the Four Emperors" each intent on placing its commander
on the throne.

Tacitus is an historian whose style and use of language is worthy
of attention. A careful noting of the actual facts he is recording
sometimes varies markedly from the impression one may receive from
simply reading his text, perhaps adorned with less than neutral
adjectives, etc.

This brief note may be expanded later into something more worthy of
perhaps the finest Latin historian. There are many interesting
details in his pages (concerning Britain, the Germans, the rise and
fall of such prominent personages as Sejanus, etc.). At present it
serves to mention his name.
