There comes the northward wind upon my face.
Adown the stairs of school I start to race.
Around a shed my feet begin to pace.

I turn my eyes to feel an eastern breeze.
I leap and chase the shadows 'neath the trees.
I feel myself in awe upon my knees.

I hear the birds in joy as comes the sun.
I hear their trilling song that night is done.
Rejoice with thrilling heart that race is done.

I view the multihued as elves at play.
I smile to feel their joy as breezes sway.
Inhale fragrances stealing hearts away.

A touch of rose, a dash of lavendar,
A sweet and spicy smell, a hint of myrrh,
A myriad delights, a nosey blur.

It's time to taste the meal this morn has spread,
To bite into the day that's now ahead.
Enjoy! Rejoice! Our days too soon are spred.
