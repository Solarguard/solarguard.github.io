<center>ANCIENT IRISH TALES</center><p> 
ed. Tom Peete Cross and Clark Harris Slover, Barnes and Noble, NY, 1969 (1936)<p>

This substantial selection from the corpus of traditional Irish stories conveys 
a vast range of romantic and mythological material. As all such inspirational 
text, it resonates intensely with readers who by the nature of their humanity 
respond according to a wide spectrum of individual perceptions, all subjectively 
valid.<p>

One may approach these stories rationally, seeking data on the history, 
genealogy, society, religion, etc. of the pre-Christian Irish.  One may seek to 
leap from these tales to intuitive inferences about these and other topics. One 
may also enjoy this demonstration of a fine story-telling tradition.<p>

This book begins with tales of the Tuatha De Danann. The first story, from 
THE BOOK OF INVASIONS, concerns the coming of Nemed to Ireland, followed by the 
arrival of the Fir Bolg, then of the Tuatha De Danann and lastly of the 
Milesians. This last, the account of the arrival of the Celts from Spain is 
noteworthy for the moving poetry it contains, as well as for the besting of the 
Tuatha De Danann, in magic and arms, by the Celts. It is also interesting that 
contention is described among the victors soon after their conquest.<p>

The next tale is "The Second Battle of Mag Tured", in which the Tuatha De Danann 
vanquish the Formorians. Here is mention of Nuada, provided with a silver hand 
by Dian Cecht after the First Battle of Mag Tured. Here is the famous dialogue 
between the door-keeper at Tara and multi-talanted Lugh. Here are examples of 
poetic exaggeration: e.g. : the porridge completely consumed by the Dagda ("They 
filled for him the king's cauldron, five fists deep, into which went four-score 
gallons of new milk and the like quantity of meal and fat. Goats and sheep and
swine were put into it, and they were all boiled together with the porridge." p. 
39), Balor's eye and the number of the Formorians killed in the battle.<p>

The third tale, "The Fate of the Children of Tuirenn", is a quest story. Brian, 
one of these offspring, sticks a spear into a pig that is really Lugh's father. 
The pig resumes human form, telling Brian that now he'll have to pay recompense 
for killing more than a pig. Lugh will only accept: "The three Apples of the 
Garden of the Hesperides" (p. 62), "The skin of the pig of Tuis the king of 
Greece," that, "Cures and perfectly heals all the wounded and diseased persons 
of the world" (p. 62), the king of Persia's poisoned spear (p. 62), the two 
steads and chariot of the king of Sicily (p. 63), the pigs of the king of the 
Golden Pillars, the puppy of the king of Iruad, the cooking spit of women of  
Inis Findevire and three prohibited shouts." (p. 63) One way of expressing what 
comes next is that in order to obtain most of these items they attack a 
succession of those extending them hospitality and return to offer these to Lugh 
who had, "Sent a druidical spell after them for the purpose of putting them into 
forgetfulness and want of recollection of what they had not obtained of the 
fine." (p. 76)<p>

Brian is allowed to carry off the cauldron, but the fight on the Hill of Midcain 
leaves the sons of Tuirenn mortally wounded. They appeal to Lugh for the healing 
pigskin, but implaccable Lugh refuses. There are some moving poems at the end of 
this tale.<p>

Among the interesting points of this story are the precision of the translation 
and the date of the original of, "And then Brian put on his water-dress, with 
his transparency of glass upon his head..." (p. 77), the concept of hospitality 
and the contrast between modern notions of the futility story and a heroic 
tradition which expects an account of the valiant deaths of protagonists.<p>
 
The fourth tale, "The Wooing of Etain", recounts how Midir, Etain's first 
husband, from whom she has forgetfully parted because of sorcery, gains her 
after first losing at chess, fidchell, ("Eochaid demanded that Midir and his 
folk should perform for him services which should be of benefit to his realm; 
that he should clear away the rocks and stones from the plains of Meath, should 
remove the rushes which made the land barren around his favorite fort of Tethba, 
should cut down the forest of Breg, and finally should build a causeway across 
the moor or bog of Lamrach that men might cross freely across it." (p. 88) ) 
and then winning. The encircling warriors are powerless to prevent the flight 
of the pair, transformed to swans. Eochaid, Etain's second husband, pursued
them to the fairy mound which he attacked and eventually regained Etain.<p>

The fifth tale, "The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel", concerns the heroic 
death of Conaire, grandson of Etain. Conaire is chosen king of Ireland as he met 
the conditions of the divination of the "Bull-feast." "A bull was killed by 
them and thereof one man ate his fill and drank its broth, and a spell of truth 
was chanted over him in his bed. Whomsoever he would see in his sleep would be 
king, and the sleeper would perish if he uttered a falsehood." (p. 97)<p>

The tale tells how Conaire exported Ireland's thieves, how there was peace in 
the country and how he began to break his taboos. Robbers arrive from over the 
sea, "And brought a stone for each man to make a cairn." (p. 109) There follow 
some ten pages of the enumeration of the champions of the hostel, as a scout for 
the brigands reports on what he saw, room by room, and Conaire's foster brothers 
among the attackers put names and quality to these descriptions, as well as an 
anticipated numerical loss such will cause opponents in the upcoming struggle. 
For example, "I swear what my tribe swears, nine times ten will fall by Cormac 
in his first onset, and nine times ten will fall by his people, besides a man 
for each of their weapons, and a man for each of themselves." (p. 112) They live 
up to their billing, for after the glorious battle and Mac Cecht's going to, 
"The chief rivers of Ireland," and, "The chief lakes of Erin," seeking water for 
dying Conaire, the surviving reavers retrieve each his stone, "So this is what 
they lost by death at the Hostel, a man for every stone that is now in Carn 
Locca." (p. 126)<p>

The second section of the book, The Ulster Cycle, begins by telling of the 
births of Conchobar, born at the same time as Christ, and Cu Chulainn whose 
nativity story includes swan women, Conchobar and Lugh. It proceeds with Cu 
Chulainn's "Boyhood Deeds." He bests the boy corps, "Thrice fifty in number" 
(p. 138), kills and replaces Culann's dog, whence his name, tosses a stone 
pillar with an ogam challenge on it into a pool and slays Nechtan's three sons 
who then confront him, returning to Conchobar with their heads.<p>

The fourth Ulster tale, "The Wooing of Emer", has Cu Chulainn directed to this 
one maiden by the Ulstermen concerned that their wives and daughters are pining 
for him, and Emer's father, disguised as a Gaulish chief, encouraging Cu 
Chulainn to study the martial arts under Scathach in Scotland. Although Cu 
Chulainn and Emer pleadge chastity, he not only becomes accomplished in 
warcraft, but marries Scathach's daughter Uathach and begets a son on Aife 
(p. 167), "The hardest woman-warrior in the world."  (p. 166) He returns to 
Ireland defeating some Formorians on the way and carries off Emer to, "The 
House of the Red Branch," and, "They were not separated until they died." (p. 
171)<p>

The next tale recounts the mighty struggle of Connla, Cu Chulainn's seven year 
old son, against his own father who kills him. This is followed by "The Sick-Bed 
of Cu Chulainn", who is punished for seeking to harm magical birds. He awakens 
to aid the fairy folk in battle and to tryst with Fann. Cu Chulainn's wife 
confronts him and his mistress, and when Cu Chulainn won't forsake his wife, 
Fann goes with her husband, Manannan mac Lir. This story has some fine poetry in 
it and one point is its mention that Manannan was a poorer chess player than his 
wife. (p. 196)<p>

Next comes the "Story of Mac Datho's Pig", in which the warriors of Connacht and 
the Ulstermen feasting at Mac Datho's hostel, during a dispute over his hound, 
contend for the honour of carving his pig. The climax of the boasting comes 
after Cet of Connacht makes way for Conall the Victorious saying, "'But if 
Anluan mac Matach (my brother) were in the house, he would match thee'...'But 
he is,' said Conall, taking Anluan's head out of his belt...'" There is a great 
melee and the famous hound is slain.<p>

The next tale explains "The Debility of the Ulstermen", because of their lack of 
respect for Macha.<p>

"The Cattle Raid of Regamna" concerns a meeting between Cu Chulainn and the 
Morrigu who predicts his death.<p>

"The Intoxication of the Ulstermen" tells of the warriors of Ulster taking a 
wrong turn and ending up at Cu Roi mac Dairi's Tara Loacha at a time when Ailill 
and Medb are visiting him. There is a conventional description and 
identification of the heroes of Ulster. A messenger arrives saying, "That the 
best hero of the Ulstermen might select the choicest house for them." (p. 232) 
Diplomatic Sencha averts the internal conflict this threatened and Cu Chulainn 
chooses the largest house, though this is actually a trap. One manuscript breaks 
off with the heroes still inside the burning iron house. Another manuscript, 
having them inside an oaken house, describes them escaping leaving Tara Loacha
ever after uninhabited.<p>

"The Exile of the Sons of Usnech" is the tragic story of Deirdre, who shrieked 
while still in the womb, chose Naisi over king Conchobar, resulting in the exile 
of Naisi and his brothers to Alba, whose king on learning of her sought the 
death of her husband, driving them back to Ireland where, despite his word, 
Conchobar had Naisi killed. This caused the guarantors: Fergus, Dubtach and 
Cormac son of Conchobar and, "Three thousand stout men" (p. 245) to depart 
Ulster to fight on the side of Connacht. After having his way with Deirdre for a 
year, Conchobar tells her he'll share her with the man she hates most next to 
himself. She dashes her head into a rock. This tale includes a very moving poem 
as Deirdre laments in her sorrow for slain Naisi.<p>

"The Adventures of Nera" tells how Nera, getting mixed up with a hanged man on 
Samhain, then follows a fairy troop into their mound. He is given a fairy women 
who tells him the three days and nights he spent with her haven't passed at 
Cruachan and he can warn of a coming fairy attack. There is a fight between the 
son of the bull of Cooley and the Whitehorned bull of Cruachan.<p>

"Bricriu's Feast" tells how Bricriu, although known for causing discord, plays 
on the pride of the heroes of Ulster and their ladies. The wives of Cu Chulainn, 
Conall the victorious and Loegaire the Triumphant have a race to establish 
precedence while their husbands contend at length to determine the obvious fact 
that Cu Chulainn deserves the champion's portion. Both Medb and Cu Roi assess Cu 
Chulainn victor. Cu Roi, not only acknowledges the pile of heads, including that
of a lake monster, Cu Chulainn collected, but demonstrates to the Ulstermen that 
Cu Chulainn alone is willing to honour his word even though it cost him his 
head.<p> 

"The Cattle Raid of Cooley" is reviewed separately under 
<a href="tainkinsella.html">Tain</a> which looks at the translation of Thomas 
Kinsella.<p>

"The Tragic Death of Cu Roi mac Dairi" tells how Cu Roi's wife betrays him and 
Cu Chulainn kills him. Then is recounted "The Death of Cu Chulainn". He goes to 
his death despite the tears of his horse and the lamentation of the ladies of 
Ulster. He is confronted by contradictory and disadvantageous gesa. He dies 
standing, his dying horse defending him, the Morrigan on his shoulders. And when 
Lugaid son of Cu Roi cut off Cu Chulainn's head, Conall the Victorious went at 
once to collect the debt of Lugaid's head.<p>

This is followed by the tale of the earlier "Death of Celtchar mac Uthecair who 
dies from a drop of the blood of his own hound and "The Death of Conchobar" hit 
on the head with a brain-ball. Then in "The Phantom Chariot of Cu Chulainn" St. 
Patrick summons the great hero from the afterlife to convert the High King 
Loegaire son of Niall.<p>

The cycle of Finn begins with "The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha", tells of the 
events connected with the birth of Finn, his inherited enmity to Goll mac Morna 
and how he concluded peace with Goll for the recompense of the land of Almu.<p>

"Finn's Boyhood Deeds," tells of him being reared by two warrior women, 
encountering warriors, learning poetry and eating the salmon of wisdom. This is 
followed by the moving story of "The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Grainne". Grainne 
prefers Diarmuid to the much older Finn. Diarmuid has ample opportunity to 
demonstrate his courage and other martial qualities until at last he falls 
killing a supernatural boar and Grainne goes to live happily ever after with 
Finn. The tale also includes mention of the intervention of Angus mac Og when 
Grainne and Diarmuid are in especially difficult straits. This tale does not 
enhance the good reputation of Finn. "The Hiding of the Hill of Howth" contains 
several stanzas of poetry, reference to Finn's dishonesty and Angus Og rescuing
Grainne and Diarmuid.<p>

"The Death of Finn", telling of how he met treachery from his hosts, how his 
efforts at avoiding battle are rejected, how Finn, "Understood that fame was 
more lasting than life for him" (p. 436), fiercely attacked the battalion of the 
Pillars of Tara, cut off the head of fer-li, cut right through Fer-tai's, "Hard 
foreign armour" (p. 438) and breaks off with the wounded hero facing five 
charging enemy.<p>

"Oisin in the Land of Youth" in some twenty pages of verse has Finn's son 
describe to St. Patrick his voyaging and abiding in Fairyland. Oisin stops along 
the way long enough to slay the giant Fomor and rescue a woman. After abiding a 
while in the Land of Youth, he wishes to see Finn again and returns only to be 
told, "But full three hundred years have passed." (p. 454)<p>

In "The Colloquy of the Old Men," St. Patrick listens to Cailte tell of the 
glorious time of Finn and is given one hundred and fifty ounces of gold ("That 
was Finn's, the chief's, last wage to me" (p. 464) ), overshadowed though by the 
gifts the Tuatha De Danann gave the three landless sons of Lugaid Menn.<p>

"The Death of Fergus mac Leide" begins the Cycle of Kings although largely it 
concerns the dealings of the heroes of the Red Branch and the Leprechans. After 
recounting the arrival of a leprechan in the palm of a dwarf and the falling of 
the king of the leprechans into a cauldron of porridge, we're told how Fergus 
wearing special shoes of the leprechans defeats a frightful loch monster dying 
in the struggle.<p>

"The Adventures of Art son of Conn" tells of Art's exile because of his father's 
second wife and then Art's very difficult quest imposed by his foster mother to 
return to Tara with Delbchaem daughter of Morgan. Art overcomes all obstacles 
and Delbchaem suggests her mother-in-law leave. One interesting aspect of this 
story is the call for human sacrifice when the land falters because of the 
presence of Becuma. That sacrifice is prevented with a cow substituted for the 
suggested victim.<p>

Next comes the tale of Art's son Cormac. This tells how Manannan mac Lir brought 
Cormac's son, daughter and wife to the Land of Promise and how Cormac acquired 
from Manannan a magical branch and a wondrous cup.<p>

This is followed by the tale of the great Niall, left to die at birth, as he was 
the king's son, but not the queen's, reared by Torna the poet, how the men of 
Tara wished Niall to be king, how Sithchenn the smith judged Niall kingly and 
how Niall was that son of his father who lay with the Goddess of Sovereignty. 
This is followed by the story of how Niall was slain by an arrow shot by 
Eochaid.<p>

Next comes the tale of Muircetach and the wondrous woman Sin whose marvels faded 
from Muircetach's sight when a cleric blessed him. She reasserts her power. Then 
he mentions the great storm (sin) outside when he was never to say her name. He 
dies drowned in a cask of wine while being burned.<p>

Then comes "The Wooing of Beg Fola", a mysterious woman who came to King 
Diarmuid for the small dowry of a little brooch and left him for Flann, the 
survivor of eight warriors on Ox Island.<p>

"How Ronan Slew his Son" tells how the son went to Scotland to avoid trysting 
with his foster mother. He returns, continues to refuse her and is killed, with 
a spear in his back, when she falsely accuses him.<p>

Next comes the story of Mongan, son of Manannan, whose account of the death of 
Fothad Airgdech is upheld by Cailte. Then there is the humorous "Vision of Mac 
Conglinne" told by Anier mac Conglinne. He was about to be crucified by the 
monks of Cork for a comment about their shabby hospitality. He recites verses 
about his vision of food and the abbot's pedigree of food. These are considered 
necessary to cure Cathal mac Finguine. Anier gets the king of Munster (Cathal) 
to fast, then eats in front of him, recounting his vision of food. The demon of 
gluttony in mac Finguine's throat at length comes out to grab a piece of food 
and a cauldron is overturned on top of it.<p>

This is followed by "The Voyage of Bran Son of Febal", a largely verse account 
of the wonders that attract him and thrice nine companions to the Island of joy 
and to the Island of Women. After what seems a year in this paradise they decide 
to leave it only to find they are in an ancient tale. When one of them touches 
land he instantly turns to, "A heap of ashes." (p. 595) The rest depart never to 
be seen again.<p>

The book concludes with four places of place names, the supposed meanings of 
such names as inber Ailbine, Boyne and Dublin.<p>

The corpus from which come the tales of this book is one of the chief sources 
for an understanding of the pagan past, although a vast range of perceptions is 
possible in this pursuit and the stories are very worthy of enjoyment even apart 
from any indications they may contain about that past.<p>
