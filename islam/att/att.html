THE HISTORY OF Al TABARI, vol 1, transl. Franz Rosenthal, SUNY, Albany,
1989

At the outset, one attempting a precis of this vast primary source,
almost two score volumes in the annotated English translation, is
honestly obliged to indicate more than the size of the work. This author
was a very learned scholar. He was an ethical historian, one listing his
sources, indeed the chain of transmission of assertions, even
disagreements in the sources. The precis here largely omits this, thus
permiting quite an inexact impression to be conveyed. Nevertheless, since 
so exemplary a "medieval" work is both highly relevant for many residents 
of this "modern" age and unlikely to be read in full by very many, this 
effort is made to communicate something of so precious a resource to 
human understanding.

At-Tabari was born in Amul, Tabiristan, close to the Caspian's southern
shore. He was precocious. He studied in Rayy, Baghdad, Basra and Kufah.
He was a tutor and impressed others with his ethical standards. He
travelled through Syria, Palestine and Egypt. He returned to Baghdad,
where he studied, wrote voluminously and taught. He never married.

He stayed lean, dark haired and healthy into old age. He was well versed
in linguistic studies, law and history, knew some poetry and medicine
and was religiously orthodox. His interactions with other scholars and
some points of disputed Koranic scholarship are considered.

Mentioned are at Tabari's inexact references to his own works. These are
listed in alphabetical order (pp. 81-134).

His great history was much esteemed. It interested Westerners since the
1600s. In the late Nineteenth Century Leiden University published an
edition. Manuscripts and translations are discussed.

There follow appendices commenting on Koran 17:79 (pp. 149-151) and
classifying and dating at Tabari's works. (pp. 152-154).

Another half dozen pages (pp. 157-164) contain the translator's forward
to volume one. This mentions at Tabari's use of Koranic commentary
concerning mythological times, his support for traditional accounts and
his opposition to rational speculation, as well as his appreciation for
the significance of an understanding of time for history.

This precis by having al agree with solar letters departs from the 
transliteration provided in the translation. 

The history itself (pp 165ff) begins with an introduction, invoking God,
praising Muhammad and noting the divine bounties, the author's intent to
summarize the doings of kings and prophets, his reliance on transmitted
reports, varying numbers adduced for years past and those to be, the
coming destruction of the world, the eternal nature of God, different
opinions on the order of things created (such as God's throne, his pen,
water, etc.), views on which day creation began and what was created on
which day.

   Now then, God created the creation in six days, from the beginning of
   the creation of the heavens and the earth to the time he finished
   creating all creatures. Each day of the six in which he created them
   corresponds to a thousand of the years of this world. p. 224

Night came before day. Celestial mythology is mentioned. Iblis, the
first ruler, became arrogant and was forced to Hell. Adam was created of
earth, Eve of Adam's rib. The snake convinced Eve and she Adam to eat
the forbidden fruit. The snake was cursed with crawling on its belly,
Eve with difficult, even deadly, childbirth.

Adam and Eve cast out came first to India. Cain killed Abel. Persian
scholars generally identify Jayumart with Adam. From him were descended
Persia's rulers down to Yazdjard.

Eve gave birth to Seth, Adam's heir. There are reports of Adam buried
at Mecca and reburied at Jerusalem. Seth lived at Mecca. Cain's
descendant Tubal invented musical instruments and lured some of Seth's
away.

Persian mythological beginnings are mentioned, the names of kings and
such achievements as iron use, city building, hunting, writing and the
domestication of animals. Jamshid established the Naw Ruz (New Year's)
festival.

Enoch was not heeded. Methusaleh succeeded him. Unbelief was rampant in
Noah's time.

   Noah was to call upon them to repent, to return to the truth, and to
   act in accordance with the commands given by God to his messengers
   and revealed by him in the scrolls of Adam, Seth, and Enoch. When God
   sent Noah to them as a prophet, he reportedly was fifty years old.
   p. 354

His lengthy efforts were largely unsuccessful. The ark was built,
animals gathered and the flood came. Noah's son Shem inherited the
middle of the earth, Ham the west and Pishon the east. Various eras are
mentioned.

There is a bibliography (pp. 374-386) and an index (pp. 387-413).

Vol. 2 Prophets and Patriarchs transl. William M. Brinner 1987

There is a two page preface and a two page forward noting at Tabari's
scholarly consideration of interwoven Iranian and Israelite sources of
preIslamic civilization.

Dahhak (Nimrod) ruled despotically. Faradin overthrew him. Considered
are various enumerations of the nations descended from Noah's three
sons. Hud called the idolaters to monotheism. Refusing they endured
drought and destruction. Salih summoned those of Thamud. They killed
his divine camel. God destroyed them.

There are various accounts as to Abraham's birthplace. Nimrod sought his
death at birth. Abraham opposed idolatry. God preserved him. Abraham
married Sarah, moved and had a son, Ishmael, by Hagar his maidservant.
Abraham was hospitable, received angels, built God's house in Mecca and
proclaimed the pilgrimmage.

Some say Isaac, some Ishmael, was Abraham's sacrifice. Willingness
absolved the sacrifice. Abraham was blessed. Nimrod rejecting God was
cursed. His tower was destroyed and the languages multiplied. Lot urged
the wicked in Sodom to repent. They refused. God destroyed them. Abraham
had eight sons altogether, six from Qaturah. Abraham died old, before
becoming senile, at his request.

Ishmael had twelve sons. His brother Isaac had Esau and Jacob. Jacob
married Leah and Rachel. By them and their maidservants he had twelve
sons. His descendant Job continued praising God despite afflictions.
Genealogists disagree about Shu'ayb. He was prophet to the people of
Midian. They disbelieved and were destroyed.

Jacob's son Joseph was envied, beaten and tossed in a well by the
others. Rescued he was sold. He lived long in Egypt. He resisted the
advances of his master's wife. Imprisoned Joseph interpreted the
pharaoh's dream concerning seven bountiful harvests followed by seven
lean harvests. Released he married, had two sons, presided over Egypt's
graneries and helped his drought stricken brothers. Thusly they came to
dwell in Egypt.

vol. 3 The Children of Israel transl. William M. Brinner 1991

There is a two page preface and two page translator's introduction
noting at Tabari's continuing efforts to integrate Iranian traditions
with Biblical and Koranic accounts.

Identifications of al Kidr vary. He journeyed with Moses performing
obviously harmful deeds that became beneficial once explained. Manushir,
the Persian ruler, is described and some kings of Yemen said to be his
contemporaries ruling there as Persian governors.

The pharaoh tried to have Moses killed at birth. Placed in a boat the
baby was found and raised in the palace. Grown, he slew a man, went to
Midian, toiled there, saw the burning bush, returned, confronted Egypt's
magicians and led his suffering people from Egypt. The sea parted for
him. God gave him tablets. Moses destroyed the calf idol worshipped in
his absence. Moses' brother passed, then Moses himself.

Joshua was vindicated of wrongdoing in the death of Moses. He succeeded
Moses and fought the giants. Zimri, a leading Israelite, brought a
deadly plague upon his people. Phineas killed him and his foreign lover
and lifted the plague. God stopped the sun so Joshua could kill them
all. Joshua conquered other cities.

Shamir was first king of Yemen ruling there as Persian governor.

Korah, cousin of Moses, had great wealth, was arrogant and had a
prostitute falsely accuse Moses. She confessed and Korah and his
supporters were swallowed by the ground.

When Manushir died, oppressive Frasiyab came until driven back to the
Turks. Zaw ibn Tahmasb drove out Frasiyab on the tenth day of the eighth
month and that became the third great Persian festival after the
equinoxes. Zaw restored prosperity and ruled well. He was succeeded by
Kayqubadh. A footnote lists the names of the six Kayanids in the Avesta,
Bundahishn and at Tabari, seven in this latter.

Caleb succeeded Joshua. Then came Ezekiel who revived the dead. After
Ezekiel misdeeds multiplied. Elijah came cursing the idolaters. Other
prophets followed, including a woman, Deborah. There were reverses.
Samuel announced Saul as king. He selected David to confront the huge
champion Goliath. David killed Goliath. After Saul and his sons died in
battle, David succeeded.

God inspired David's psalms and iron making. Although David had ninety
nine wives, he sent Uriah on a dangerous mission and after Uriah's death
married Uriah's beautiful wife. Angels criticized him and he repented.
David's son Absalom led a rebellion. David prevailed. He wanted to build
the temple, but his hands had blood on them.

Solomon succeeded. He met and married Bilqis, Queen of Sheba. Other
accounts have him marrying her to Dhu Tubba of Yemen. Solomon captured
Sidon and married the king's daughter. Told is a tale of a sea monster
disguised as Solomon, getting Solomon's ring. Solomon reigned for forty
years.

v. 4 "The Ancient Kingdoms" transl. Moshe Perlmann, 1987

Rustam was named tutor of Kayqawus of Balkh's son, Siyawakhsh. Grown
Siyawakhsh aroused the lust of his father's wife. Spurned she turned
Kayqawus against his son. Siyawakhsh settled amongst the Turks, some of
whom envious slew him. His Turkish wife bore Kaykhusrawanh. Rustam
attacked the Turks with an avenging force. Later he rescued Kayqawus
being held captive in Yemen.

Israel split. God saved Asa, king of Judah, and Benjamin from a massive
Indian invasion. Later God protected Zedekiah from Sennacherib of
Babylon's host. Nebuchadnezzar later took Jerusalem and the Jews were
scattered, including to Arabia. Nebuchadnezzar had acted as governor for
the Persian kings Luhrasb, Bishtasb and Bahman.

Jerusalem fell because of its iniquity. Daniel and others divine
prophetized for Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar invaded and devastated
Arabia. Zoroaster appeared and revealed twelve thousand cowskins of
texts which were placed in Persepolis. Persians fought Turks. Yemeni
kings and doings, including a copper statue with South Arabian
inscription, are mentioned.

There were Cyrus, Darius, Darius and Alexander. Alexander married
Darius's daughter Rushanak to continue the Persian monarchy. Darius also
had two sons, Ashak (whence the Parthian Aracids) and Ardashir (whence
the Sasanids). Alexander allegedly conquered India, Tibet and China and
penetrated into the Arctic circle.

The Ptolemies succeeded Alexander. Three hundred and three years after
the rise of Alexander, Jesus was born. The Selucids ruled in Iraq and
Ashak in Persia. There was fighting with Rome. Rome moved her capital to
Constantinople. Various chronological calculations are mentioned and
accounts provided of John the Baptist and Jesus.

Wonders described are accounts of the virgin birth, the idols toppling
when Jesus was born, Jesus from his cradle defending his mother's virtue
and Jesus urging his disciples to consider each other. The names and
reigns of some Roman emperors are mentioned.

Recounted are reigns of preIslamic Arab rulers, including impressive
Jadhimah, Amir of the Necklace and the Queen al Zabba. She dealt
treacherous vengeance and received the same in return. Other references
are made to voyages to India, Samarqand and China, to the seven
Christian youths in the cave, to Jonah, to three divine messengers sent
to Antioch, to Samson and to the Christian martyr Jirjis.

v. 5 The Sasanids, the Byzantines, the Lakmids and Yemen, transl. C.E.
Bosworth, 1999

The translator notes the importance of this text for Sasanid history,
the impressive German translation and commentary by Theodore Noldeke in
1878 and the valuable work in recording South Arabian inscriptions, in
numismatics etc. since.

Ardashir, son of Babak, son of Sasan, fosterson of Tira, achieved
military success with divine aid. He appointed civil and religious
officials, had his son Sabur crowned and wrote a will.

Sabur attacked the Roman Empire, capturing the emperor Valerian. He
defeated al Dayzan. Mani arose at this time. Sabur appointed his son
Hurmuz king and wrote a will. Shabur reigned thirty years, Hurmuz one.
Next came Bahram I who executed Mani. Bahram II (274-291) followed,
then Bahram III (292), Narsi (292-302) and Hurmuz II (302-309).

Shapur II (309-379) was brilliant and courageous. He built a second
bridge over the Tigris at Ctesiphon. He struck back at Arab raiders,
pushing deep into eastern Arabia, coming close to Medina. He made a
truce with Constantine, defeated Julian and forced Jovian to pay
reparations. Skilled medical practitioners arrived from India.

His brother, Ardashir II (379-383) succeeded, then Shapur III (383-388)
and Bahram IV (388-399) who was assassinated. Yazdajird (399-400) was a
cruel and vicious ruler killed by a kick from a supernatural horse.

The famous palace of al-Khawarnaq was built near Hira. The Hiran ruler
al Nu'man renounced the world in the thirtieth year of his reign. His
son, al Mundhir I (c. 400-418) was the foster father of Yazdajird's son
Bahram V.

Bahram V (410-438) was precocious. He slew a lion and a wild ass with
one arrow. He slew two lions with his mace to gain the royal regalia in
a contest with the usurper Kisra. He enjoyed pleasures, but when the
Turks threatened he defeated them and killed the Khaqan. One day while
hunting, Bahram V fell into a hole and died. Bahram achieved impressive
feats in India and his armies did well against the Byzantines. He even
penetrated to East Africa.

Yazdajird II (438-457) sought to rule well. He sent his vizier Mihr
Narsi to collect tribute from the Byzantines. His son Fayruz fled to the
Hephthalites. After ascertaining Yazdajird's injustice, they decided to
help.

Fayruz I (459-484) was helped to the throne by the Hephthalites. During
his reign there was a severe drought. His measures against hoarding
prevented starvation. His prayers for rain were answered. He had
building projects.

Fayruz attacked the Hephthalites, was guided into a desert, swore peace,
broke his oath and died disastrously defeated. Sukhra, a noble from
Shiraz, courageously won the release of Persian captives and treasure.

At this time the Himyarites were influential among the Arabs. Tubba ibn
Hassan, considered insane for a while, was very learned. He sent his
nephew al Harith against an Nu'man. Al Harith was victorious.

Balash (484-488) succeeded Fayruz. Qubadh I (488-531) succeeded Balash.
He had a building program. He faced the Mazdak rebellion, was captured
and rescued. He had the influential Sukhra killed. He fought against the
Byzantines and took Amida. There are Arab legends of Tubba treating with
Qubadh and defeating him in battle; Tubba is said to have sent forces to
China and Rome. He travelled to Yathrib, Mecca and died in Yemen.

Qubadh's son Kisra Anusharwan (531-579) succeeded. He defeated heretical
rebels, reordered the realm, strengthened the military and achieved
success in his campaigns, conquering Antioch and resettling its
population. The Prophet was born during this reign.

Persian appointees ruled as king of the Arabs. Tubba was furious with
Yathrib, but assurances it would be the abode of a future Prophet
checked him from destroying it. An effort to trick him into attacking
the Kaaba failed. Indeed, he respectfully covered it. After ordeal by
fire, Yemen accepted Judaism, Tubba's new religion. Tubba destroyed the
oracular shrine at Ri'am.

Recounted is the earlier story of the King of Yemen's prophetic dream
and the movement of the Lakhmids to al Hira in Iraq to avoid the future
Ethiopian invasion. There was the sleeplessness of Amr brotherslayer and
Dhu Ru'ayn's exonerating verses.

Dhu Nuwas killed vile king Zur'ah and reigned next in Yemen. Faymiyun, a
devout Christian, by his prayers and miracles attracted Salih. The two
were captured in a caravan raid and sold in Najran. There they invoked
God's curse against the sacred tree and gained converts. One convert was
a youth who had been studying with a sorcerer. He began to heal by means
of the greatest name of God. The king's confrontation with him sufficed
to convince the town.

Jewish Dhu Nuwaz destroyed Christian Najran. Byzantine ships transported
avenging Ethiopian forces to Yemen. Dhu Nawaz pretended submission and
arranged for the killing of Ethiopians divided on their way to separate
treasuries. A strong force overwhelmed him. Ethiopians struggled among
themselves for leadership.

An impressive church was built at San'a. It was intended to replace
Mecca as a pilgrimage site. The Ethiopians advanced on Mecca intending
to destroy the kaaba. They brushed resistance aside. Abd al Muttalib,
leading Quraysh and supporter of pilgrims, met with Abrahah the
Ethiopian leader and told him God would defend the kaaba. Divine birds
destroyed many Ethiopians with deadly stones and drove away the
survivors. Abrahah perished.

The four Ethiopian governors (Aryat, Abrahah, his son Yaksum, Yaksum's
brother Masruq) ruled seventy two years (transl. 525 to c. 570).
Byzantium declined to assist Yemen rebel; Persia sent a force, killed
Masruq and drove out the Ethiopians.

Khalid (al-Harith) contested with al Mundhir. When Justinian ignored
Kisra's complaints, the Great King defeated the Byzantines capturing
even Antioch. Kisra established a land tax. He appointed Babak military
commander, sent victorious expeditions to Yemen and Ceylon (transl. "The
story of a Sasanid conquest of Ceylon is, of course, pure legend.").

There were signs, such as the extinguishing of the perpetual flame of
Fars on the birth of Muhammad. A Yemeni tribute caravan was attacked by
the Banu Yarbu. Anusharwan blamed and struck at the Banu Tamim.

Hurmuz succeeded. He was just, favoured the people, ordered the army to
move without unduly damaging crops and punished his own son Kisra for
disobeying. He refused pressures to persecute Christians. His general
Bahram defeated the Turks, then rose against him. Hurmuz was blinded.

Kisra Abarwiz the Victorious, son of Hurmuz, supported by a Byzantine
army, defeated and drove out Bahram. He granted religious tolerance to
Christians. Bahram was later slain among the Turks. When the Byzantine
emperor Maurice was overthrown, Kisra opposed the usurper. Jerusalem
and Alexandria fell. Persians approached Byzantium itself. Heraclius
came to the Byzantine throne.

Heraclius struck hard, defeated the Persians and caused Kisra's
commanders to defect. Muhammad's appearance was indicated by dreadful
omens for Kisra. An Nu'man refused Kisra's request for concubines. He
was summoned to court, imprisoned and died there. He had left valuables
with the Bakr tribe. They refused to hand them over, were attacked and
at Dhu Qar and defeated the Persians.

There was rebellion in Yemen. Al Murazan, the governor, by a marvellous
leap of his steed, gained an inaccessible fortress and crushed the
rebels. On his death, Kisra dismissed al Murazan's Arabic mannered son
Khurrakhusrah and appointed Badhan. Kisra was arrogant and brought ruin
upon himself. He was overthrown.

Qubadh II (628) had his father Kisra executed. He killed seventeen of
his brothers. he fell sick and died after ruling eight months. Ardashir
III succeeded at the age of seven. Shahrbaraz led a force from the
Byzantine frontier, overthrew him and had him killed. Shahrbaraz was
himself quickly assassinated. Kisra's daughter Buran reigned justly.
She returned the True Cross to the Byzantines.

A number of other short reigned monarchs are named, including Yazdajird
III who soon felt Arab invaders. Chronological comments discuss various
dating of the period from creation to the hejra.

Here ends the five preIslamic volumes.
