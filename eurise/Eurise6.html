This summary was made for my personal study. I have not been so keen to place quotation marks around the author's exact wording. After all, the entire thing, except for William, L. Langer's brief introduction and where the author quotes someone else, is the work of Frederick L. Nussbaum. This, by the way, is the volume of the twenty that most impressed me. I wrote a review highly praising Nussbaum's presentation so precisely of so extensive and varied a survey of this period.

(xi-xii) Introduction: William L. Langer introduces the book with two standard paragraphs, plus one specific to this volume: this period saw the launch of the Newtonian worldview, which has recently been expanded to include Twentieth Century relativity.

(xiii-xiv) Preface: Frederick L. Nussbaum notes his Cartesian theme, applicable except in dealing with European states' anarchic international relations.

I i. (1-6) The Cartesian Revolution: This dissociated the material from the divine. Two key works were Descartes's Discourse on Method and Newton's Principia Mathematica. Cartesianism, although opposed by religious authorities, spread widely. Malebranche sought to unite reason and religion. Spinoza asserted the unity of God and the natural world.
ii. (7-8) The Discovery of Science: The history of science poorly preserves both the unsuccessful contemporaries and those who formed the foundation, enabling Newton's success. Descartes helped provide the modern, more precise meaning of the word science. Seventeenth Century scientists were not today's specialists. Some also were interested in theological issues. 
iii. (9-15) Science as Social Form: Many writers seemed little aware of science or satirized it. Boyle was read and received serious comment. Boyle amd other scientists showed continuing interest in alchemy and theology. Belief in magic and witchcraft persisted. Persecution of witches, while continuing, declined. More people worked at science. Scientific associations formed and strengthened. England's Royal Society was organized (or reorganized) in 1660. The French Academy of Sciences, founded in 1666, was established as a royal agency. Huygens was invited from Holland to be leading member and Cassini from Italy tp manage the observatory. There were highly significant co-operative efforts, including the map of France. Scientific journals quickly disseminated information.
iv. (15-20) The Concept of the Physical: Theology was set aside. The focus was on the material. Boyle was very influential in setting aside the medieval idea of qualities as entities. Measurement became important and accuracy much more precise. Measurement applied to people led to demography. History was affected. There was accumulation and analysis of documents. Criticism of documents extended to Homer and the Old Testament. "Logarithms, slide rules and computing machines had been invented to facilitate large scale computation." (p. 19) Analytical geometry furnished materials for Newton and Leibnitz to organize as calculus, whose symbols and procedures Lagrange systematized in the next century.
v. (20-24) The Achievements of the New Science: In chemistry, Robert Boyle defined element and missed discovering oxygen. Robert Hooke assimilated respiration to combustion. Biology saw advances in classification, augmented by the wider reaches of global trade. Valuable work was being done by microscopists, much utilized until the Nineteenth Century. Huygens arrived at Newton's Third Law that action equals reaction. He also worked on the pendulum clock. Boyle found that pv is constant. Telescopes and microscopes had a growing place in science. Grimaldi proposed the first wave theory of light. Romer proposed a finite velocity for light and Huygens followed him. Newton used transverse light waves to explain polarization. Newton and Huygens discussed color. Newton wrote on the importance of experiment.
vi. (24-27) The Principia Mathematica: In 1687 the Royal Society published the Principia Mathematica, a work providing the frame of reference for science for two centuries. The work was a synthesis of advances made over the preceding two centuries, including by Nicholas of Cusa, Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo. In 1674 Hooke asserted attraction of heavenly bodies, movement in a straight line unless deflected. Newton and Leibnitz developed calculus.

II i. (28-31) Baroque in the History of Europe: The Baroque period reached from the Sixteenth Century deep into the Eighteenth. It was characterized by: transformation, individualism, seeking to control nature, "the dynamism that was, and is, the most distinctive mark of Europe as a culture." (p. 29), clarity, learned detail, resonance with the Catholic Counter Reformation, exuberantly original and vigorously transported by Europeans around the world.
ii. (31-37) The Baroque as Architecture: Michelangelo and Vignola began this in Italy. Andrea Palladio formulated its rules. Bernini and Boromini were prominent Baroque architects. Bernini was invited to submit plans for the Louvre. French national taste rejected them. Boromini demonstrated the age's individuality. He was criticized by some unappreciative of it. Each major Italian state developed its own form of Baroque. Spain was influenced by its Arabic, Germanic and Hispano-Roman past. Iberian colonial architecture, e.g. in Mexico, Peru and Brazil exemplify Baroque. French Baroque more utilized Classical restraint and simplicity. French gardens were similar to those in Italy. German Gothic and Baoque are closely related. The Thirty Years' War and German poverty impeded monumental construction. Austria's imperial, aristocratic and religious structures demonstrated the Empire's majesty and Catholic spirituality. Europe's North and East show Western influence. England and Holland resisted the Baroque.
iii. (38-46) Baroque in Music: Music's significance in European culture comes from the Baroque Age. Baroque music attained novel flexibility and range. Opera, developed in Italy, was key. Moliere encouraged Lully to write operas, previously unpopular in France. Lully, popular in France and abroad, composerd Opera annually from 1672 to 1687. Emperors Ferdinand III and Leopold ! keenly patronized opera, causing Vienna to become an Italian opera center. Hamburg became the center of German opera, thirty one composed there from 1678 to 1690. Charles II sought to establish opera in England, though English preference for drama largely minimized opera's presence. Italian opera and ballet were known on the fringes of Europe. Church music composer Heinrich Schut was a main source for Baroque music entering Germany. Protestants later accented folk music's influence in northern Germany. Baroque's instruments, organ and violin, developed. Impressivr organists and violinists lived in this period. Courts, royal and other, highly prioritized music. Emperor Leopold I and Portugual's King John IV were renowned composers. Baroque music was widely popular. Many attended performances. Music clubs throve. Numerous music manuals appeared. Longstanding music guilds, unable to adapt, declined. The new music became professional and enduring.
iv. (47-53) The Baroque as Painting and Sculpture: Baroque painters sought to express life, did so exaggeratedly, largely depended on patrons, also painted lower class people, other painters and themselves. Italy exerted primary influence on European painting. France's Charles LeBrun (1619-1690) organized painters and sculptors for Louis XIV's projects, especially Versailles. In Holland, Rembrandt died in poverty. Craftsmen appeared seeking bourgeois acceptance and receiving it. In Spain, for two centuries Esteban Murillo (1618-1682) was very highly regarded and El Greco not esteemed. Twentieth Century is the reverse. Bernini (1598-1680) held the heights in sculpting. In Spain, thence in Mexico, there was significant sculpting in wood. 
v. (53-60) The Baroque as Literature: French literature ascended replacing Italian dominance. French became the language of the upper classes. Germany had a large Baroque literature, little influenced from outside. England, as in other spheres, only partially responded to French literature. French Baroque writing begins with Malherbe (1555-1628). Boileau (1636-1711) sought to codify French poetry's rules, drawing from Classical thought and themes. Racine's clarity and Moliere's comic survey of his society's flaws, including hypocrisy, manifest the Baroque. Moliere was much criticized. "He held only the support of the public, of Boileau and of Louis XIV." (p. 57) Racine portrayed love, conflict between duty and desire, finding tragedy where Moliere found humour. Drydan may be seen as an example of the entire spectrum of English literature. "He was not only one of the most learned and perceptive of critics, but also dramatist, satirist, annalist, lyricist, translator and adapter." (p. 60) Bunyan's allegorical Pilgrim's Progress, a simple sort of fantasy novel, has remained popular.

III i. (61-64) Absolutism in European History: Europe was transitioning from feudal concepts of divine right to a realist view of the powerful state, an entity Hobbes felt was between individuals and universalism. He saw the state as a force restraining human evil. He wrote that people agreed for self protection to grant a sovereign complete authority and responsibility to provide and protect. Spinoza, feeling the state a necessary instrunent for self fulfillment, criticized Biblical texts supporting divine right.
ii. (64-71) Mercantilism as a Phase of Absolutism: Medieval Europe had been an extensive Catholic economic system. Kings now sought to benefit from economic activity. Various European rulers wanted an increase in production (material and economic). They aimed to increase their economic power, while diminishing that of competitors. Mercantilism was secular. Governments controlled industries (e.g. wool) to restore quality, lowered by war and disorder. Swedish royal direction of lumber and mines drew French attention. Colbert improved transportation, including by building a canal from the Mediterranean to the Bay of Biscay. In England, Parliament controlled economic matters, advantaging landlords and businessmen over the interests of others, including colonials and foreigners. Holland and France faced special English opposition. The Navigation Act (1651, 1660) would have more seriously impacted foreign and colonial trade, if enforcement capacity had been better. Prussia's Frederick William's policies were impressive:

"His rationalization of the tax system, integration of his widespread territories by the improvement of transport and communication, encouragement of immigration, employment of experts, establishment of commerce colleges, promotion of industries new and old, toleration of religious variations--all conceived in the specifically mercentilist spirit of statism  and absolutism--corresponded so completely to the needs of his depressed and disrupted society that, from a human point of view, it is impossible to withhold admiration." (p. 70)             

After his death and Colbert's, their countries witnessed the ascendency of priviliged groups.
iii. (71-76) Absolutism as Facade: France: On Mazarin's death (March 7, 1661), Louis XIV assumed full responsibility for government. He gave nobles's former power to his minister, leaving them titles and perquisites. He suppressed robber barons. He forced the submission of parliament. He took control of towns, repudiating their debts. He determined his ministers simply by summoning them or not. The intendants gave France what unity it had.
iv. (76-79) The Control of the Army and the Navy: Le Tellier and Louvois raised the army's effective strength to 400,000 men, imposed training, discipline and the chain of command. Experts (Vauban in fortification, Du Metz in artillery, Chamlay in geography and topography, Martinet in discipline) provided systemic strength to the army. Constant revolts, provoked by high taxation, were brutally suppressed. Colbert took a neglected navy and transformed it into a considerable force. He organized: timber, sail making, cannon foundries, ship building, etc.
v. (79-85) The Work of Colbert: Economic and Legal Unification: Colbert's ideal was a self sufficient France, with everyone productive, and investors preferring commerce and industry to bonds and offices. He sought internal free trade, succeeding only in the northern third of France. He established silk cultivation, promoted horse breeding, halted deforestation, encouraged large families and immigration (regarding emigration from France treason) of skilled craftsmen. Investors poorly supported his proposals. Wars seriously impacted him. Some industries (e.g. sugar, iron, glass, textiles) were fostered. Colbert's efforts for a uniform legal structure did not wholly succeed, but did provide foundation for future work, including Napoleon's.
vi. (85-86) The Co-ordination of ReligionL Louis XIV encouraged a more rational Catholicism, clashing with the papacy over such issues as his right to money from vacant bishoprics. He refused proposals to follow England's lead and officially head a French church, but he continued effective control.
vii. (87-91) The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes: Religion divided France. The Protestants were a minority, only a million or so of twenty million. There were efforts to persuade or fund conversion. On October 18, 1685, Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes. Many Protestants accepted and converted. Some two hundred thousand, mainly bourgeois, fled beyond France.
viii. (91-106) King or Parliament: Absolutism in England: Charles II returned from exile seeking religious tolerance, but Parliament's intolerant Anglicans opposed his efforts at toleration. Plague in 1665 killed nearly seventy thousand in London. The Great Fire of 1666 destroyed two-thirds of London. England's morale shrank. Parliament forced the dismissal of Charles II's minister Clarendon on August 30, 1667. This actually strengthened the King, as Clarendon's policies somewhat diverged from royal preference. The Cabal (Sir Thomas Clifford, Lord Arlington, the Duke of Buckingham, Lord Ashley and the Earl of Lauderdale) now governed. Carefully drafted religious toleration measures were rejected by the Anglican strong House of Commons. The Treaty of Dover provided for joint English-French action against the Dutch and French funds to Charles to make good what the English Parliament was not supplying. Dutch opening of the dykes and the Battle of Texel (August 21, 1673) frustrated Holland's enemies. Anglicans in Parliament remained intolerant. Osborne put England's finances in order. The political party was emerging. Charles II switched from Clarendon to the Cabal, and from the Cabal to Danby. Bribes came from France and Holland. "Louis XIV" gave "Charles II a large subsidy to dissolve Parliament and disband his army." (pp. 102-103) Unreliable witnesses disclosed a Popish plot. Charles II dismissed Danby and invited Shaftesbury to head the privy council, composed now of some from each party. When it failed, Shaftesbury was dismissed. The Rye House plot led to arrests, executions and Shaftesbury's flight to Holland, where he died. By 1685, Charles II had obtained control of England and its constitutional machinery, though he did not live long afterwards and his successor was inadequate.

IV i. (107-122) The Creation of a State: The Great Elector of Brandenburg: Frederick William, especially from 1660 until his death in 1688, created the pattern that over two centuries established a unified state. His instrument was his administrative system. Its central element was the privy council of Brandenburg. A lieutenant headed each province, supported by councilors and tax commissioners. Frederick William laid the essential foundations of the Prussian Civil Service with its traditions of pride, efficiency and honesty. His agents raised the funds needed to  maintain an adequate army, and for him to function as a European sovereign. He overcame resistance and some older authorities disappeared or were subordinated to him. He made his army more professional. He used funds from foreign powers (Holland, Spain, France, Austria) for that purpose. His army was well disciplined, trained and equipped. He reconstructed agricultural areas that had been devestated in war. He encouraged immigration, especially by persecuted religious minorities. He controlled the guilds. He fostered his textile, metallurgical, brewing, etc. industries, attracted skilled workers, mainly Dutch, introducing production of paper, tapestries, stockings, mirrors, gloves, candles, etc. Frederick William improved road and river transport, including by joining the Elbe and the Oder by canal. He bettered ports and established an effective and economical postal service. He enforced religious tolerance. This included Catholics and Jews. He advanced secondary and higher education. Interested in science, he maintained a chemical laboratory, established the first zoo and developed libraris, especially Berlin's, which in 1688 had 618 manuscripts and 80,000 books.
ii. (122-131) The Empire, the Hapsburgs and the Danube: Westphalia marked the end of the Empire's universality. It recognized princes' independence. Sweden and France intruded. "Louis XIV continued to wield an influence in Germany superior to that of the emperor as such." (p. 124) Ausria's Leopold I achieved as much in state building as Brandenburg's Frederick William. Austrian administration was cosmopolitan. Hungary asserted self identity and tried to play off Turkish and Austrian overlords against each other. A Hungarian conspiracy against Austria was uncovered and suppressed. The office of palatine (leading Hungarian noble) was abolished. Hundreds of Protestant pastors were sent to the galleys in Naples. Louis XIV meddled, arousing a response which included the restoration of the palatine and increased religious tolerance.
iii. (131-135) Royalist Revolutions: Denmark and Sweden: Young King Charles XI reversed military defeats suffered by the regents. With popular support, he broke the power of the regents and the magnate class, and took firm control of the kingdom. In Denmark, the heroic defence of Copenhagen against Sweden in 1660 raised the prestige of King Frederick III (1648-1670) and increased bourgeois self confidence. Nobles's resistance was overcome, and on October 13, 1660, Denmark became a hereditary monarchy. Frederick III established an effective administration. Peter Schumacker exerrted considerable beneficial influence, until his peace keeping brought his downfall and imprisonment. Louis XIV forced Denmark to restore conquered lands to Sweden. Schumacker's policies, peace included, developed. King Charles XI married Sweden's Princess Ulrica Eleanora.
iv. (135-140) Holland: Republican Unity Versus Orangist Unity: John de Witt effectively led Hollan's republican government. De Witt partly wrote the popular and influential work "The True Interest of Holland" arguing dynastic concerns disadvantaged the state. Orangists wrote a refutation, and urged that the author be punished. William II had died in 1650, shortly before William III's birth. By 1670, De Witt's popularity had decreased, and William III's claim to power was hard to ignore. As France and England prepared war against Holland, the republic dissolved and William III ruled. On August 20, 1672, a mob killed Cornelis and John de Witt. William III faced opposition over his military policy, etc., but prevailed.
v. (140-146) The Negation of Absolutism in Switzerland and Poland: Switzerland had grown from three to thirteen cantons, differing in religion, wealth, etc. Each was keenly self focused, but they firmly drew together when threatened from beyond. Poland was very Catholic with 650 monasteries and widespread devotion at all levels of society. Polish scholars were prominent in Germany, Italy and the University of Paris. John Casimir, the Vasa dynasty's last ruler, came to the throne in 1648. He defended Poland, sought to settle the succession and tried to improve the condition of the peasants. Following military success, he presented Poland to the Virgin Mary. His attempts to resolve the succession and peasant issues were frustrated. Nobles resisted his authority, and he retired to France. Michael Wisniowecki succeeded him. He faced internal opposition and a Turkish invasion. John Sobieski defeated the Turks and succeeded Michael. He faced internal and external opposition. He could not strengthen Poland. He failed to transfer the rulership to either of his sons. Augustus of Saxony ruled after him. In the next century Poland disappeared.

V (147-150) Introduction: Europe was a society, a community, but one having serious issues. 

"The society we are examining was prolific in genius, in common sense, in organizing ability. It could properly be expected that intelligence, comprehension and high purpose would be applied to the control of human relations in general and to the relations between the states and peoples in particular." (p. 147)

"The fact was almost completely opposite. It was a period of marked unintelligence, immorality and frivolity in the conduct of international relations, marked by wars undertaken for dimly conceived purposes, waged with the utmost brutality and concluded by reckless betrayals of allies. Moral indignation is perhaps irrelevant and certainly supererogatory, but objectivity can hardly obscure the fact of shortsighted aims and badly calculated maneuvers." (p. 148)

i. (150=154) The Power Pattern in 1661: Louis XIV's reign began with Europe largely peaceful, though overseas pirates and smugglers, etc. and threatening Turks challenged that perception. Spain's population, economy, power, etc. had declined. The Hapsburgs, deprived of effective control of Germany, ruled over a variety of lands, some strongly asserting individual identity, some fearing the Turks. France, recently victorious over Spain, and backing a German League of the Rhine against Austria, was strong. Holland was impressive economically. Poland was weak and disorganized, though it still held Livonia and the Ukraine. Russia was weaker than the powers holding the Black and Caspian Seas. Many Italian lands, though not Rome, positively responded to French influence.
ii. (154-156) The Anglo-Dutch War, 1664-1667: Commercial rivalry led to war. In peace time England seized New Amsterdam, renaming it New York. Both sides were weak on land and at sea. Other countries, including France, supported Holland. The peace allowed England to retain New York.
iii. (156-160) The Devolution War, 1667-1668: Louis XIV married Spain's Maria Theresa, renouncing all her claims on condition of her prompt payment of her dowry. It was not promptly paid and Louis helped Portugual and England against Spain. He also asserted claim to the Spanish Netherlands. Holland, disliking French proximity, sought allies. Louis XIV discouraged this. French troops advanced into the Netherlands, forcing Spanish forces to fall back. He offered, on the impending death of Spain's Charles II, to share with the Emperor the division of Spanish territories. Charles II actually lived until 1700. Spain and Portugual made peace. On May 2, 1668, Louis XIV accepted peace, though still aiming at further conquests in the near future.
iv. (160-172) The Franco-Dutch War, 1672-1678: Realizing that France's commercial pressure would result in war, Holland sought allies. French diplomacy, including payments, neutralized many. England agreed to fight with France against Holland. England's Charles II secretly assured Louis XIV that he would restore England to the Catholic Faith. In Holland, on February 24, 1672, William III was placed in charge of land and sea forces. France declared war on April 6, 1672. France scored initial victories in Germany, arousing opposition from a number of sources. The situation became reversed with a great alliance formed against France, which was standing increasingly alone. Sweden was defeated and largely lost control of the Baltic. France looked for help from the Poles and the Turks, but neither came to her assistance. Also, within France heavy taxation to help fund the war provoked rebellion. French military might remained strong, but the list of her enemies lengthened. On August 10, 1678, Holland and France agreed to peace. The Emperor joined it on February 2, 1679. On June 29, 1679, Brandenburg accepted peace with France and Sweden. France had failed and created within Holland's William III a significant enemy. At the time, France's military might seemed very impressive and her enemies seemed weakened.
v. (172-176) The Reunions, 1678-1684: Louis XIV claimed, backed by French courts, territories that expanded his realm. Some objecting he seized by force. Holland attempted to reform an alliance against France. England refused to join. The Turks attacked Vienna and were repelled. Spain declared war against France, lost and made peace. The Emperor and Spain agreed to a twenty year truce with France. Louis XIV's revocation of the Edict of Nantes caused substantial international opposition.
vi. (176-178) The Power Pattern in 1685: France had gained land and enemies, many foes more ready to ally against France. Protestants were aroused by Louis XIV's revocation of the Edict of Nantes. French arrogance stirred widespread repugnance and animosity. Louis XIV did not analyze and correct his attitudes and policies. Europe failed to overcome its divisions.

VI (179-180) Introduction: Religion was significant in this period. There were two main strains of religious experience: intellectual and mystical. It was mainly Catholics who sent out missionaries, and their encounter with the vast non Christian world helped increase awareness and tolerance.
i. (180-182) Jansenism: Jansenism began as a renewal within Catholicism of grace and good works. It rejected the Pope's competence to decide matters of fact and failed to accord the French king the recognition of his authority he required. Jansenist nuns, scattered from their home at Port Royal to various convents, very effectively spread their views and were returned and isolated at Port Royal.
ii. (182-185) Cartesianism and Religion: Catesianism distinguished the realm of mysticism from the world to which the intellect applied. Biblical criticism developed.
iii. (185-186) Syncretism: For generations many tried to unite divided Christianity. The Council of Trent had this goal. Poland succeeded in uniting Orthodox to Catholic acceptance of Papal authority. German syncretist George Calintus died not long before our period and inspired Frederick William to attempt to unite Calvinists and Lutherans. This failed. Louis XIV sought in vain to bring Huguenots and Catholics together. England's new prayer book was designed for division.
iv. (186-188) Deism: Deism is a natural, rational religious attitude. It was held by a variety of people, including: Thomas Browne, Joseph Glanvill, Robert Boyle and the Earl of Rochester. The Cambridge Platonists, interested in Cabala and Hermetic philosophy, sought to connect the Christian religion with philosophy.
v. (188-197) The Inner Light: Quietism, Pietism and Quakerism: Mysticism pervaded this period's religious life, less a matter of special individuals and more one of groups, though Quietists sought transcendence and personal attainment. Pietism arose from the religiously complex soil of Holland and was influencial far from there:

"It provided the rule of life that governed nineteenth-century America, the sobriety, decency and simplicity, the rigors of the Sabbath, the bibliolatry that marked even the last generation of Americans." (p. 191)   

Pietists included Jodocus van Lodenstein (perhaps its first organizer), Jean de Labadie (whose spiritual path wandered far, including to Germany, where he exerted considerable inluence), Philip Jakeb Spener (who underlined the importance of the mystical experience). There was a conservative reaction. Pietism spread far. A distinctly English brand was Quakerism:

"The Quakers believed that God continued to reveal himself to the responsive soul and that the "Inner Light" was available to every human being as a living and enduring personal experience. Although Quakerism was anything but negative, it is convenient to express the spiritual ideal in negative terms: no connection with the state, no infallible creed, no hierarchy, no essential forms or ceremony, no organization as such." (p. 195)

England persecuted, imprisoned and deported Quakers. In 1682, William Penn founded in America the largely Quaker Philadelphia and Pennsylvania.

VII i. (198-203) The Social and Intellectual Advance of the Businessman: This was a period of economic expansion, successful overseas traders, capitalists joining together to form stock companies, growing towns and flourishing urban culture. Bourgeois served in key government positions; nobles engaged in business. Jacques Savary's The Commerce Code (1673) and the Complete Businessman (1675) presented information and advice re business opportunities in various geographical locations around the world. These became valued as authoritative. Savary recommended double entry book keeping, a practice going back to Fourteenth Century Italy.
ii. (203-209) Urbanism and the Economy: Some old cities declined, some new ones expanded. By 1700, Paris and London each had populations of half a million. Amsterdam focused significantly on using wind power. That city had such industries as sugar refining, tobacco manufacture, silk spinning and printing. It had forty presses in 1664. Naples, by the Eighteenth Century, became the third largest city in Europe. The court and the government were important factors in London's economy. Immigration was key to many urban economies. Public transportation was available in Paris and London. Modern conveniences (water, street lights, postal system, free news sheets, etc.) were available, but sanitation and sewage were poor quality. The importance of supplying growing cities, such as London, with grain, led to a transformation from medieval restrictive trade practices to a more modern and freer trade.
iii. (209-211) The Transportation Net: Navigation improved. Ship sizes remained constant, but their number greatly increased. Holland had many more ships than other countries. Roadways, postal systems and river transport improved. 
iv. (211-217) Money and Credit: American silver and West African gold helped fund Europe's expanding economy. Outflow to India, etc. mitigated inflation. Much Spanish bullion went to Holland, France and England. Financial institutions were weak. Amsterdam handled much of France's money. Wealthy immigrants benefitted Holland and England. The credit system was undeveloped, but improving. The Bank of Amsterdam, founded in 1609, took a leading role in European finance and credit. The Thirty Years' War overcame Nurnberg's Bank, but Hamberg's survived. The Bank of Sweden was the first to issue "true banknotes" (p. 215). England and France faced the situation of loans to kings, who were able to suspend repayment. Loans helped finance public works. Spanish colonial monasteries loaned money. 
v. (217-219) The Stock Company: Larger numbers of investors joined such associations, now becoming more common. Companies, e.g. the Hudson Bay Company founded in 1670, could provide substantial profit to shareholders. For some time, stock companies functioned like state agencies, gradually developing a more private character. Insurance of goods was common:

"Marine insurance was highly developed. Amsterdam remained the unchallenged capital of the business. Its insurance chamber maintained sixty warships to protect its customers from pirates in the Baltic. (p. 218)

There was able insurance against fire, as well as life insurance.
vi. (219-222) The Advance of Agricultural Techniques: Europe's population remained largely (80-90%) agricultural, retaining, despite some available novelty, traditional methods. Land transport continued to be costly, and local famines with high loss of life occurred. Relatively few English enclosures took place in this period. Some new crops, including potatoes, were grown. Spain's Association of Sheep Growers declined.
vii. (222-225) The Transformation of Industry: Handicrafts remained prevalent. Guild masterships were effectively hereditary. Generally, putter outs supplied material to people who worked from home.  Concentration of workers in factories was now developing rapidly. Swedish high quality iron was doing well. Newer industries, dealing with colonial products, e.g. "sugar, tobacco, chocolate, cotton," rose unconnected with guilds. Industry was moving from cities to the countryside. Europe was becomming richer, its rulers, aristocrats, bourgeois accessing more luxuries, its great cities directing global business.

VIII Introduction (226-228) The late Seventeenth Century was a significant phase of European expansion, a process that had begun several centuries earlier. Internally, there was the rise of towns, increased specialization, etc. Externally, Europe pushed back the Turks, extended Western influence to Russia and established European bases overseas.
i. (228-237) The Europeanization of Russia: Westernization began even before Peter the Great. Kiev was a center for the spread of Western culture. Christians split between traditionalists and innovators. The traditionalists were persecuted and increased numerically. Education was a divisive issue with mathematics (geometry and Arabic numbers particularly excluded) in disfavor. Russian art had felt Byzantine influence, especially in icon painting.  Western styles were introduced, but remained unpopular. Western music, opera and ballet, was imported. Baroque architecture likewise entered the country, especially under Peter the Great. His dynasty ruled absolutely. There was difficulty controlling the Cossacks. Russia expanded east as far as the Amur. A treaty was signed in 1689 establishing Chinese-Russian borders. 
ii. (237-244) The Recovery of the Danube: Seventeenth Century sultans were feeble successors to Suleiman the Magnificent. They delegated their viziers to lead Turkey's forces against Europeans. In 1669, following a twenty one year siege, Venice surrendered Crete to the Turks. Colbert's reinvigorated French navy achieved control of the Western Mediterranean. Turks joined Cossacks fighting Poland. Poland's King John III tried, in vain, to unite Europe against the Turks. Turkey struck hard agaibst a Hungarian rebellion, driving further into Silesia and Moravia. The Turks attacked a divided Europe. In 1681, Russia acquired Kiev and the Eastern Ukraine. The Turks struck straight at Vienna. Breaking the Turkish siege of Vienna, and driving the Turks from Buda ended Europe's vulnerability to toreign conquest.
iii. (244-260) The Expansion Overseas: European expansion was global. Spanish settlers, soldiers and religious spread Spain's language and religion. Some natives were well educated. The Spanish regarded the French, English and Dutch in the New World as interlopers. Pirates preyed on Spanish ships and even attacked Spanish towns:

"For the Spaniards the buccaneers were a terrible scourge. Between the years 1665 and 1671 alone the corsairs sacked eighteen cities, four towns and more than thirty-five villages... In 1685 the marquis de Barinas estimated the losses of the Spanish at the hands of buccaneers since 1665 at sixty million crowns." (p. 253)

Jesuits were the leading missionaries in Canada. They and the coureurs de bois (fur traders) had reached the head of the Great Lakes. They pushed on and down the Mississippi Valley. Englishmen heading to the colonies were essentially escaping controls. They had uncordial relations with Natives. Virginia's Governor Berkesley's refusal to permit colonials to attack Natives sparked a rebellion. It was defeated and many rebels hung. England seized New Amsterdam and renamed it New York. William Penn received from the Crown lands that were named after him. The Hudson Bay Company formed in 1670. Eastern cultures were higher than the Europeans, except in military technology. Portugual dominated Eastern seas, until the Dutch replaced them. Dutch overseas centers (e.g. New York, Pernambuco, Capetown) were cosmopolitan. Dutch traders in Asia reached from Nagasaki to Isfahan, with Batavia the center. England sought to emulate the Dutch, but lacked land and commercial importance. France failed to supplant the Dutch.
