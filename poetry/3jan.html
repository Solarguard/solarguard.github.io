Three January Poems (2006)

During this month which has begun with unusually warm weather and has
Canada poised perhaps to begin a shift in its political leadership,
three uplifting poems have flowed, as affirmations of the positive,
keeping in the tradition that it is good to speak of what is good and
attract the realization, materialization and attainment of what is very
worth while.

1. A dark expanse attired in light,
   A blind array endowed with sight,
   A cold landscape begins to warm,
   A frozen void receives a storm.

   We greet the air, welcome the heat.
   We feel the need to move our feet.
   We fling the door and step outside,
   Inhale the air and cease to hide.

   Instead we're free to breathe again
   Rejoice appreciating rain,
   At land that shakes itself awake
   And smiles at each departing flake.

   A world enduring frost and snow
   At dawn, at spring renews its glow,
   Prepares to grow its gown of green
   Becomes a jewel in joy serene.

2. A mind alert, a brain awake,
   A man, human, woman will make,
   Today, some day to come, a way
   Away from here towards the ray
   Of hope a groping race can weave
   A world at peace; can we believe
   That ages past are really gone,
   That now at last there shines a dawn
   That womb abiding ends in birth
   And newly born emerges Earth,
   The cradle home of people true
   The beasts evolved, a species new.
   Not I, non-I, but we all free
   Of strife; non-life is history.
   A world is garbed in smiles and glee.
   Today is born humanity.

3. The time has come to greet, welcome
   The guests we meet, the friends that from
   So far away arrive to call
   Upon us here and wave to all.
   We'll show to them a world at peace,
   Reveal to them how we release
   Ourselves from all that stained our past
   Display that now we've gained at last
   Our way away from primal womb
   Our way above an early doom.
   Now born are we, now borne and free,
   Unchained from hate and enmity.
   The shell, in shards upon the Earth,
   With wings outspread, our flight, our birth
   Attains the wide unending sky
   And gains up high a space to fly.

Michael McKenny January 2006 C.E.
