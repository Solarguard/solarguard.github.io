NORTHERN MYSTERIES AND MAGICK, Freya Aswynn, Llewellyn, St. Paul Mn,
2002 (1988), originally titled LEAVES OF YGGDRASIL.

This key text in modern runic studies and Asatru begins with a six
page forward by Lionell Snell outlining the great significance of
speech and of writing in the evolution of human society, conveying
the image of approaching the abandoned old deities being like
seeking again household animals left for generations to grow up in
the wild, and stating the authenticity of the author, one who has
studied and lived the runes.

Freya Aswynn has a twelve page introduction to this edition,
presenting her Dutch origins, her other worldly awareness from the
age of four, her rough childhood, her association with British
Wicca, her reception and study of the runes and her coming back to
the old Germanic gods and the Northern Way. One specific point is
her daily eating square cakes inscribed with the futhark in order as
she meditated on them, one rune a day.

Chapter One, "The Northern Tradition in Perspective" (pp. 1-4)
offers the concept of the old faith being swallowed by the wolf
fostered Romans, the Roman Church succeeding where the legions
failed. There is mention of mythology and Icelandic literature as
source material for a Northern tradition to join Western, Southern
(African) and Eastern (from India, etc) traditions.

Chapter Two, "Elder Futhark" (pp. 5-93) begins with the early origin
of the runes and possible connection with Greek, Latin and Etruscan
or North Italic alphabets. Freya Aswynn personally favours a
combined native and North Italic origin. She mentions the prominence
of the Heruli in the area now known as Denmark.

   "Heruli" was used in the Viking Age as a title for a type of
   rune-master and denotes a trained magician or shaman rather than
   someone who was merely able to chisel runes in stone. The
   evidence indicates that the Heruli were most probably the people
   who disseminated knowledge of the futhark, and by so doing their
   tribal name has been passed down throughout history as a title
   applied to those with special skills in rune-lore. p. 6

There is the natural origins and associations connected with sounds,
the perceptions of shamans and their efforts and sacrifices to
attain insight and the coherent twenty-four rune system, rendering
excessive the modern accretion of a blank rune. Later linguistic
developments resulted in the thirty three Anglo Saxon runes and the
Sixteen younger runes. Now follows a consideration, rune by rune, of
the elder futhark:

Fehu is cattle, wealth, with its attendant connotations of
responsibility, of greed, of reputation surviving death. She
corresponds Fehu to the Vanir: Niord, Frey, Freya, and to the
energy and time to generate wealth.

Uruz is aurochs, perceived by her as masculine primal energy, a
potent source of vitality, health, vigour and rejuvenation. She
corresponds Uruz to Thor, notes the German word ur (ancient, primal)
and the Norn Urd.

Thurisaz is Thor, giant. It can be thorn and she sees it as a potent
rune for magical work, one capable of misuse, but very tricky and
prone to backfire on abusers. Also, it is a powerful protector.

Ansuz is god, the triple god Odin, Villi and Ve. It is speech,
wisdom and consciousness. She also corresponds it to prana or Odic
energy. She sees it as unfettering.

Raido is riding or journey and in this she sees control of one's own
path, ordering one's own circumstances, knowing and moving within
one's own limits, riding and not being ridden. Raido is also the
turning year and its rituals, symbolized as an eightspoked wheel.

Kenaz is torch, illumination of the hidden, the unknown, the way to
other realms of consciousness. It is knowledge uncovered, learning
and teaching, focus and striving.

Gebo is gift, receiving as well as giving, the balance and
reciprocity of a gift for a gift. She connects this with the concept
of compensation, hence contracts and legal agreements, including
borders between lands. This understanding of recompense, of the
returning impact restrains one from excessive demands and from
harmful magical sendings.

Wunjo she sees as perfection, noting that others see it as joy. She
connects it to Wodan, "fulfiller of wishes." Wish can here be seen
as the true will of the magical practitioner.

There follows here a couple of pages on cosmological correspondences
of the first aett, seen by Freya Aswynn as containing awareness of
creation, of the mythological primal cow Audhumla, the giant Ymir,
the gods, the earth, the sun and moon moving in their courses, man
and woman and the completion, perfection and joy of creation.

Hagalaz is hail. She connects this with the Norn Urd and sees it as
disruptive influences arising from the past, often unlearned lessons
even from previous incarnations. There are the correspondences with
the underworld, the goddess Hella, the unconscious, Gullveig,
witchcraft in the dark sense, and also the younger futhark form of
the rune, looking like two Algiz runes, used as protection from bad
weather.

Nauthiz is need. She connects this with Skuld, Norn of the future.
There is need open and more deeply psychological with the issue of
living up to one's own standards. There is Nauthiz as protection, as
fettering attackers, as the need-fire in hard times, as the control
of fire symbolized by the binding of Loki.

Isa is ice. She connects this with Verdandi, Norn of the present.
Isa is the present in a static sense, resisting change, cold, hard,
unyielding. It is I and it is a powerful rune cooling down heated
situations and protecting one from disruption, from aggression, from
magical attacks.

Jera is year, harvest. She sees this as time, as gradual and
generally beneficial change. She connects it with Baldur and Hodur
and locates it at Yule.

Eihwaz is yew. She names Edred Thorsson and Thorolf Wardle for the
yew as Yggdrasil and she sees jera also as the human backbone. She
sees it as daring, as suggestion yew sword and yew bow, as connected
to Odin and Uller, the hunting god, as facing conflicting emotions
or difficult choices.

Pertho is birth, though some others have seen it as secret or gaming
piece. Thorolf Wardle does emend the Anglo-Saxon rune poem to read
"birthhall" instead of "beerhall." She connects it to the Well of
Mimir, corresponding to the Akashic records, to the Norns, to
Frigga, to the secret and the hidden.

Algiz is protection. There is a connection with divine twins. Some
say Baldur and Hodur, though she sees it more likely to have been a
male and female pair, such as Frey and Freyja or Niord and Nerthus.
It is protection and hence suggests the shield maidens, the
Valkyries. Also, it can be seen as the Rainbow Bridge to Asgard,
higher consciousness, and associated with the guardian Heimdal.

Sowulo is sun. She sees this as feminine, because in the north the
sun was less destructive and more nurturing than in the south. She
sees it as corresponding to consciousness, as indicating action or
purpose. She connects it to Sunna, to Holland's sun goddess Barbet,
to Baldur and to Odin's all seeing eye.

The cosmological correspondences of the second aett she sees as
destructive, as adding to cosmic time the awareness of aging and
death, as the sacrifice of Odin on the yew tree and the offering of
his eye at the Well of Mimir, as begetting the Valkyries,
concluding with the consciousness of Sowulo, though this process
began with Jera.

Teiwaz is Tyr, an early wargod, associated also with justice, oaths
and legal conflicts. Freya Aswynn acknowledges her difficulty with
Tyr.

   I have never found Tyr to be a god with whom I have a strong or
   natural sympathy. Gods are like people: some you get along with,
   others you find less in common with. It is as simple as that.
   p. 69

Berkana is birch, though she states the Anglo-Saxons called it
poplar. She sees this as connected to birth, children, women, the
goddess Berchta, fertility, shamanic or soul journeying and
creativity.

Ehwaz is horse. She sees this as vehicle, both car or motorcycle and
the physical body, or the psychological persona, as connected to
marriage, co-operation and partnership, as adjusting to a situation,
in distinction to Raido assuming control.

Mannaz is man, in the sense of human. She mentions legends of the
origin of humans and of the three orders, connecting this with
Heimdal. She sees Mannaz as indicating individuals and intellectual
development.

Laguz is lake. She connects this with the goddess Nerthus, mentions
sorcery and Laguz, the astral substance, dreams, the favouring tide
(or the opposite if the rune is reversed) and love.

Inguz is Frey, perhaps the patron deity of England, named after him.
She sees this rune as one of fertility, notes its capacity to
substitute for a magical circle, as well as a container for other
runic working. There are correspondences of growth, completion,
progress and transformation.

Othila is noble. Some see this as inherited land. She sees also the
inheritance of genetic material. She notes that Odin is asserted to
be the god of the nobility, but shares also her understanding that
this was later aristrocratic usage and originally he had been the
deity of the tribe. The shape of the rune expresses Inguz plus Gebo.
She discusses blood and soil, as well as loyalty.

Dagaz is day. She sees this as rapid, even cataclysmic, change, as a
connection between opposites, a rainbow bridge connecting the right
and left sides of the brain, the end and the beginning of cycles, a
cloak of invisibility in time of need. She connects Dagaz to Loki
and Heimdal and to Midsummer. She notes Othila as last rune on the
Gotland stone but agrees with many that Dagaz feels better as last.
There are also the eight Dagaz runes at New Grange.

The cosmological correspondences of the third aett she sees
pertaining to human evolution. Teiwaz is here the Iron Age and
Berkana agriculture and settled communities. Ehwaz is domestication
of animals. Mannaz is law, logic and patriarchy. Laguz is feeling,
magical tradition and spirituality. Inguz is awareness of deities,
Dagaz the end of the old cycle and the start of a new one and Othila
the renewed homeland.

Chapter Three, "Runic Divination" (pp. 95-125), begins with origin,
with sounds, sigils, postulated prehistoric civilizations, historic
alphabets and mystery schools, and Christian eradications of much
Northern spirituality. Divination is more than fortune telling. It
is psychic contact with the collective unconscious of the people,
either by birth or oathed blood relationship to the folk. The future
can be flexible for one working the web of wyrd. There are
invertible and reversible runes, four that are unchangeable (Gebo,
Kenaz, Isa and Inguz).

Methods of divination include the cast and the drawing of three of
these runes described by Tacitus, an astrological cast, the
Yggdrasil nine-world tree system, the fourfold wheel and the
eightfold wheel. She then lists divinatory runic meanings based on
her expositions in Chapter Two. Next comes a reading in which the
runes are drawn randomly and paired with the futhark in order. This
includes the comments of the querent. There follow the runes in
relationship counselling and a sample reading.

Chapter Four, "Runic Magic" (pp. 127-172), begins with definitions
of magic, underlining the importance of will. Then comes a look at
individual practise (shamanism) and group ritual. There follows an
eight page consideration of the runes, in futhark order, as they
relate to magical work. Next is the advice to make one's own runes
and the appropriateness of various trees.

   It is worth considering that Tacitus wrote that only the woods of
   a fruit-bearing tree were used in ancient times, and this
   guidline certainly holds true for divination. Wild apple and wild
   pear are native to the Northlands and are particularly suitable
   for women rune-diviners. For magical applications, hazel, willow,
   rowan, and birch are recommended. All these types of wood are
   especially suited to so-called Moon magic. Birch works well in
   fertility spells, willow for darker female magic; rowan is best
   for healing, and hazel is ideal in divination and witchcraft.
   Male workers may prefer ash or yew-ash for divination and other
   forms of magic. p. 138

She provides a putative dozen Nordic astrological houses and writes
of the nine worlds attributed to the nine non-invertible runes. She
considers attributions of Gebo, Dagaz, Inguz and Isa to the four
quarters or directions. She states the paucity of information on
rituals, names three traditional ritual dates (Yule, Spring and
Harvest) and outlines the eight Neo-Pagan high holy days.

Next comes consideration of the one hundred and forty fourth stanza
of the Havamal. This refers to ritually cutting the runes,
divinatory ability, colouring the runes red, testing, praying,
sacrificing (consecrating and dedicating), sending and destroying.
She recommends further research and meditation on the stanza. She
next suggests three runes each for the charms mentioned in Havamal
133-155. She states that the mysterious eighteenth spell requires
individual effort and remarks that a male seeking a female lover
should utilize runes of masculine sexuality. Personally, the concept
would also seem resonant that runes associated with seeking and
female apply here. She proceeds to ritual use of these charms,
replete with casting circles on days corresponding to the ritual
intent with appropriate deific invocations.

Power sigils, shamanism (underlined as subjective, experiential,
facilitated by the sound of chanting and drumming and as permitting
the assumption of animal form), runic magical response to
divinations and a table of correspondences conclude the chapter.

Chapter Five, "God Profiles" (pp. 173-198), begins with the origin
of deity, with Earth Mother and Sky Father, with differentiation and
personification of attributes. It states that religion is organic
and the evolving deity forms naturally are free of the concept of
perfection. She considers the development of Wodan or Odin and
elemental correspondences for that god. She traces monotheism back
to Akhenaten, notes the unbalanced absence of the feminine in
monotheism and proceeds to consider the Aesir, Vanir and giants,
attributing the giants to the animistic forces worshipped by early
inhabitants of Northern Europe, the Vanir to the fertility deities
of the first agriculturalists there and the Aesir to the militant
deities of later invaders.

   Thus it could be that the giants were the gods of the Stone Age,
   the Vanir the gods of the Bronze Age and the Aesir the gods of
   the Iron Age. p. 180

There follow the "god profiles," descriptions and correspondences of
Odin (underlining his modern importance as magician and initiator),
Tyr (stating his significance in contracts and legal issues), Thor
(mentioning his connection to earth and his defensive nature), Frey
(identified as the horned god), Niord (a reconciler wielding an
axe), Heimdal (she speculates that he lost an ear to match Odin's
eye and Tyr's hand), Uller (she mentions him for snow and bow and
female counterpart Ullin) and Loki (with Christian influence for his
negative characteristics; she discourages invoking him).

Chapter Six, "Feminine Mysteries" (pp. 199-238), begins by noting
the original disproportionate male influence in modern Asatru with
the current redressing of the balance. She states this edition has
been specifically revised with this in mind. There were seeresses
(volvas) and the term haegtessa was used of shamanic women whose
intuition and wisdom were expressed in tribal consultations.
Correspondences to the Roman Vestal Virgins are raised and the
issue of the impact of motherhood on magical capacity. There are
the Disir, the Matronae, some of whom are identified with river
goddesses. There is seidr, feminine trance work, etc. There is
reference to Hrafnar's (an Asatru group, including Diane Paxson) use
of material from Eirik's Saga.

Odin's connection to feminine mysteries is considered, his
mythological relationships to various goddesses and to the
Valkyries, his daughters. Nineteen stanzas of the Sigdrifumal are
quoted, those dealing with rune-lore: for victory, to safeguard
against poison drink, to ease childbirth, for safe sea voyaging, for
healing, for justice and for understanding.

There are the Norns and consideration of time. Then goddesses are
enumerated and their correspondences: Frigga (underlining the
concept of non-interference in the wyrd of others), Freya ("She is
primarily the goddess of love and war, life and death." p. 228),
Iduna (Bragi's wife caring for divinely potent apples, "the goddess
of vegetation." p. 231), Hella or Holda (originally the beneficial
welcomer of those dead who belonged not to another deity) and
others, possibly aspects or other names for those above.

The chapter and the text proper conclude with a three page "Outlook
on the Future," stating the importance of balance in the awareness
of Northern mythology, of the goddesses, of the feminine traits and
arts, such as "healing and divination," and in the participation of
women in the restoration of traditional religion.

   The outlook on the future is not bleak, however. After all, this
   is the first work on the runes written by a genuine follower and
   practitioner of the elder Northern faith that has appeared in
   England, indeed in Europe, for many decades. And it is a woman
   who has produced it. p. 236

There is a chart of elder, younger and Anglo-Saxon futhark, an
appendix of four pages defining terms, bibliography (pp. 243-245),
index (pp. 247-251) and the volume even came with a cool bookmark
containing the elder futhark in order.

This is the most informative work on the runes which I have read,
thoroughly indespensible, in my view, to anyone seriously interested
in them.
