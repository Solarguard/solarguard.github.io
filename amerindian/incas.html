REALM OF THE INCAS, Victor W. Von Hagen, Mentor, New York, 1961 (1957).

This introduction to a truly fascinating topic begins with a 
geographicaland historical survey, mentioning the long presence of 
civilization prior to the advent of the Incas.

   What do the myths say? The Sun God created the first Inca, Manco   
   Capac, and his sister, on the Isle of the Sun in Lake Titicaca. p. 
p. 33

The author continues this legendary account of the founding of Cuzco 
with some imaginative interpretations of this and he balances 
evidence from archaeology to counter such claims as Inca derived 
etymologically and genetically from Ingas (English).

   The Incas developed within the valley of Cuzco and the whole cycle 
   of their mythology contains not even the slightest suggestion of   
   any tribal migrations outside of the Andean region...They had, it  
   is only repeated for emphasis, the same cultural tools as all      
   other Andean folks: the polished stone celt, forms of agriculture  
   following the same irrigational techniques, the domesticated llama 
   (it had been domesticated for two thousand years before the coming 
   of the Incas). And finally they had as the base of their society   
   the earth-cell commune, the ayllu, or communally held land. p. 35

The book proceeds with a physical description of the Incas, their 
dress, the Quechua language and the ayllu:

   The ayllu has been defined as a clan of extended families living   
   together in a restricted area with a common sharing of land        
   animals and crops so that everyone belonged to an ayllu. An Indian 
   was born into it. The commune could be large or small, extending   
   itself into a village or a large center (marka) or even into a     
   complex city; for even Cuzco, the capital, was itself only an      
   aggrandized ayllu. p. 46

The author next considers marriage, monogamous commoners and 
polygomous nobles, architecture and daily life. One rose at dawn, 
laboured in the fields with breaks for the morning meal (around 9 AM) 
and the midday meal. An evening meal (between 4 and 5 PM) was 
followed by such work as repairing tools, sharpening knives, weaving 
and preparing the beverage aka. p. 53

Women prayed at the local shrine for a good birth. Babies were 
called, "Baby," until two, then given a temporary name until fourteen 
when they were named after their father, an uncle, an animal or, if 
female, after a star, plant or other beautiful word.

   For the Indian the huaca was first the religion of the family,     
   then of his ayllu -- and then only lastly, that of the Sun, the    
   state religion ... Huaca was animism and was what the Romans       
   called numen. pp. 56-57

The author next looks at agriculture. He asserts that most of the 
foods eaten in the world were first domesticated in South America. He 
provides a list of American and European food and industrial plants, 
stating that cotton is curiously the only item on both lists. He 
describes the European role in the intercontinental transmission of 
plants. He looks at corn and the potato, including the potato 
preservation technique. He describes the communal nature of 
agriculture, the state storehouses, terracing, irrigation, scaring 
birds, harvesting and offering to the huaca (local shrine).

   The best-known and incontestable huacas were those built in the    
   fields; they are still to be seen throughout the Peruvian coast.   
   Some near Lima contained upwards of twelve million individual      
   bricks. They began, certainly, as a stone deposit; as an Indian    
   worked the fields he tossed stones onto a common pile. This became 
   a shrine and was formed into a stepped pyramid, as most huacas are 
   built. Then on top was added a gaudy canope, where a wooden or     
   stone effigy was placed. p. 69

Next comes a look at labour for the state, including the upkeep of 
bridges and the great project of building the fortress of 
Sacsahuaman. Thirty thousand people worked on this fort for eight 
years. Idleness in this context was in effect avoidance of taxation 
and punishable by death.

There follows a look at llamas and their relation and similarity to 
camels. The llama is smaller, was never milked, but it was a beast of 
burden, the wool of which was used and its dried meat (charqui) gives 
English the word jerky. Also,

   ...its lungs were consulted in times of dire stress for the omens  
   they would reveal, just as the Romans consulted chickens'          
   entrails. p. 77

Next, there's a consideration of wool and cotton.

   Llama wool, coarse and greasy, was spun in a distinctive           
   brown-white   color, as fiber for heavy blankets, durable sacks    
   for llama transport, and ropes and llama halters. Vicuna, soft,    
   silky, the finest in the world, was reserved only for the highest, 
   luxury, weaving. The wool was dyed before carding and              
   spinning...the pre-Inca graves of Paracas have yielded so          
   fantastic a collection of weaving techniques and colorings that    
   one textile expert distinguished 190 hues! p. 80

Then there's an examination of pottery, in the absence of the wheel 
using the coil method. Soldiers used three-legged pots. Designs are 
usually geometric patterns.

The book then turns to trade and the market:

   ...agricultural discoveries were exchanged rapidly through the     
   medium of the trade market, so that within the entire Western      
   hemisphere almost every type of agricultural product was known     
   throughout the three Americas. Obsidian for knives traveled        
   thousands of miles from the place of origin; emeralds, which are   
   found only in the narrow corner of a mountain called Muzo in       
   Columbia, found their way to Mexico and south into Peru as luxury  
   items. The Mexican market brimmed with luxury items: chocolate,    
   vanilla, gold and silver objects, feather weavings, ornamental     
   sandals. And thus, the Peruvian. p. 90

Travellers, requiring permission to use the roads, paid tolls. While 
three market days were decreed each month, there was no currency and 
the state did not interfere in the bartering.

Next comes a look at holidays, festivals, rituals, games, songs, 
dances and musical instruments and then crime and punishment. Since 
the system was designed to alleviate want, theft was a serious crime. 
If it was caused by need, an official faced punishment for failing to 
perform his duty. Then follows health and sickness.

   When an Indian fell ill, a hampi-camayoc, literally a              
   "remedy-keeper", was called in. The usual beginning, after a       
   display of the shaman's kit, was either a fast, a salt emetic, or  
   a purgative root. Later, after a routine of enchantments, the      
   hampi-camayoc acted as a masseur, rubbing the patient until he     
   extracted by sleight of hand some foreign substance: a needle, a   
   pin, a pebble. He had removed the cause. After this, medicine was  
   prescribed. p. 102

He mentions diseases, the Mochica custom of burying a doctor with his 
dead patient, successful trepanning of heads and the use of coca, 
including by amautas (diviners). He proceeds to death and the 
afterlife:

   At death, the survivors put on a sort of mourning. Women lopped    
   off their long hair, shrouded their faces, and offered food to all 
   who came to the rites. There was a slow dance performed near the   
   body; the women beat on small drums and sang dirges. The body of   
   the dead one was flexed, knees up to chin, and shrouded in his own 
   tunic and wrapped in cloth. In the Andes his tomb was under rock   
   eaves; the smaller catacombs -- round, square, or oval -- were     
   made of field stone and cemented with adobe mud. Inside the tomb,  
   the sitting body had placed about it food, bowls of chicha, and    
   the many small things of his life.   p. 111

The dead lived, had unseen power, but ordinarily ceased to be of 
concern.

Part Three (pp. 113-131) looks at the capital and its royal resident. 
The author speaks of the supremecy of the monarch, of 
sister-marriage, the many concubines and offspring. These last were 
trained in arms, warcraft, the Quechua language, religion, history 
and administration.

   At fourteen years, the sons of the nobility assumed the            
   breechclout; a llama was sacrificed, the blood of it smeared on    
   the boy's face. An oath was sworn to the Inca, and the boy         
   received his plaited wool sling, shield, and a silver-headed mace. 
   At the end of the sixth day's ceremony, his ears were pierced, and 
   he became officially a warrior in the Inca's elite guards. p. 116

There follows a list of Inca rulers, a repeated insistence on the 
Andean origins of the Incas, mention of the nomination of the new 
ruler in the lifetime of his father, the deceased ruler's concubines 
following him to the grave, mummification, the sumptuous lifestyle of 
the absolute ruler, who never wore the same clothes twice, ate on 
gold and silver dishes and whose palanquin Pizzaro considered his 
choice item of loot.

There comes a description of Cuzco, the capital, with some detail on 
the amount of gold embellishment: gold leaf on the buildings, gold 
statues, gold stalks of corn and even life-sized gold llamas grazing 
on that golden corn. In addition, there's reference to the gridded 
streets, the various peoples residing in the city, each with its 
national head dress, and the royal and priestly buildings. The Temple 
of the Sun had six major structures:

   sanctuaries to the Sun, Moon, Stars, Lightning, Rainbow, and a     
   sort of chapter house for the priests of the Sun... pp. 129-130

Chapter Four, "The Achievements" (pp. 132-208) begins with 
architecture. First, the reader is reminded of the extent of the Inca 
realm.

   ...from the Sun temples and fortress of Purumauca on the north     
   bank of the Maule River (35 o S. lat.) in southern Chile, north to 
   the Ancasmayo River (approximately 1 o N. lat.), which is now in   
   Columbia -- 3,250 linear miles... At the height of Egypt's Middle  
   Kingdom, to give historical comparison, its structures covered a   
   distance of only 625 miles... Within this immense geographical     
   span there was a uniformity of style and purpose of building       
   marking it all "Inca." pp. 132-133

The author then mentions and describes some sites along the great 
Inca roads and even provides some diagrams. He mentions some dispute 
as to whether the fortress of Sacsahuaman predates the Incas or was 
built through much of the Fifteenth Century. He mentions the superb 
work in stone, even though hard bronze was known.

   The advantages of metal should not be exaggerated in stoneworking; 
   the Neolithic cultures showed clearly that trees could be felled,  
   canoes shaped, posts made, and stone walls carved with stone       
   instruments. Stone hammers were made: hematite, basalt, or         
   epidiorite. Stone chisels made of these materials are found        
   abundantly in many Inca sites. pp. 146-147

The author turns to metal: gold, silver, copper, tin, bronze. Then he 
reviews the four quarters of the Inca Empire, each ruled from a 
capital about thirty miles in its direction from Cuzco. East lay 
Paucartambo, capital of Antisuyu, the heavily fortified and defended 
area against the forest people. Some tribes paid tribute:

   ...gold, bird feathers, chonta wood, dyes, fruits, animal skins,   
   wood fibers, and jungle-reared cotton. Other tribes, notably the   
   Aguarunas ("water people"), a subtribe of the headhunting Shuaras, 
   never yielded, and the Inca's troops were decimated in the humid   
   jungles where the tactics of mass attacks and envelopment were of  
   little value. p. 155

Towards the ocean was Paccari-tampu, capital of Cuntisuyu. This had 
been finally pacified c. 1466 CE and provided a tribute which 
included seaweed and fresh fish. Then came the largest quarter, 
Collasuyu:

   This quarter embraced all the land southeast of Cuzco, including   
   Lake Titicaca, what is now Bolivia, Chile (except its very humid   
   tip), and the whole of mountainous Argentina. p. 156

Thence came gold, tin and copper (for bronze), wool (vicuna and 
alpaca) and ostrich feathers.

The fourth quarter, Chinchasuyu, had its capital at Rimacpampa. It 
stretched 1,250 miles to Quito. Next comes estimates (500,000?) of 
the population of each quarter, the unending labour of the apo 
(governor), the royal roads, with their consistent twenty-four foot 
width, their distance markers every four and a half miles, their many 
laterals and their two main lines (3,250 miles through the Andes and 
2,520 miles along the coast), bridges, including the impressive one, 
one hundred and forty eight feet long over the Apurimac River, 
waystations every twelve to eighteen miles apart, the use of llamas 
and humans to transport cargo, litters, rafts and the Incas' mental 
block concerning the ocean.

   This was one of the fundamental errors of Inca psychology in their 
   war with the Spaniard: the Incas could not conceive of anyone      
   getting reinforcements from the sea. They did not fear the sea;    
   they ignored it. p. 179

Next comes a look at couriers, running in relays, two hundred and 
fifty miles a day, at the fascinating quipu (knot) messages and 
records. This is followed by a reference to oral literature and to 
Inca-Spaniard poets such as Graciliaso de la Vega and felipe Guaman 
Poma de Ayala. There is a discussion of the drama Ollantay. This 
concludes:

   Ollantay cannot be regarded as Inca, except in its theme, yet the  
   Incas did perform dramatic presentations of sorts, with mimes,     
   dancers, hunchbacks, and bards, followed by chanting recitations   
   of dramatic history by the amauta wisemen. p. 195

Then comes a consideration of war and conquest. The Incas used 
slings, maces and shields. They relied on massed might and speed. 
Divination by means of scrutinizing the lungs of a black llama was 
performed on the advent of conflict.

   The Incas were not as blood-thirsty as were the Aztecs, but        
   captives were taken, led in triumph through Cuzco to lie prone in  
   front of the Sun Temple as the Inca trod upon their necks,         
   symbolizing the victory. Heads were taken from the more ferocious  
   of the enemy and made onto drinking cups (as with the Vikings). if 
   the enemy was especially hated, they flayed the captives alive,    
   then stuffed their skins in a ridiculous mimicry of life, making   
   the stomachs into drums which they beat when warming themselves up 
   for battle. p. 200

After a brief look at the Incas' conquests and means of ruling the 
defeated, integrating where possible and transferring populations 
where necessary, the book closes with an account of the arrival and 
triumph ofthe Spanish.

This little paperback has a lot of text in it and that text is 
tremendously interesting.
