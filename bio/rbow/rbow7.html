RAINBOW Michael McKenny

Chapter Seven Thrust

Instantaneously, I visualized my right thumb rubbing across the
middle finger of the same hand. As I did this I mentally
envisioned the complete matrix, not only of my own being, but of all
those who had held my position in the long existence of the Council
of Colours. At once, quicker than the twinkling of an eye, my life
force, my spirit, fully activated my mighty emerald ring of power,
adding several more covering layers of Terran kabbalistic and
Enochian magic to enhance the cloaking of the ring. This ring is the
great reservoir of the residue of the learning, the character, the
will of all those who have worn it. Its magical capacity exceeds
almost every other magical artifact ever made.

I was intently alert, fully focuesed. I had no doubts as to the
exertions which I would now be called upon to make. I had no
illusions as to the implications of the spell they were attempting.
I knew that it had been successfully completed only once before, and
that a world regarded that as the darkest moment in its long
history.

I visualized the precise steps I would now take, my intentions, my
willed thoughts keyed to endow my purpose with such a magical
intensity that what I beheld in the realm of potentiality and
cognition would undoubtedly be transformed into actuality and
reality. I began to walk slowly, steadily, irresistibly closer to
the place where now this abominable ritual was being conducted.

Kevin saw me and I felt his astonished and relieved gaze from inside
the verdant globe of light. And, at the same time, I noticed the
look of doubt in his eyes. I was but one against nine. I seemed but
a Terran youth, while they were fearsome alien sorcerers. What could
I do to rescue him?

I smiled in the most reassuring manner I knew. Then I held out my
hand. I would continue to foster our adversaries' mistaken
impression that they dealt only with lesser, even only with human,
adepts, or rather dabblers. With a keyed thought a dozen nanoseconds
long, I activated the image that I held a great wooden staff, which
reached several centimetres above my head. Such, especially
glimmering faintly with what they would consider a reckless waste of
my life force, may appear far more impressive than the dull matrix
of my ring of power. However, the reality, in this case, as in so
many others, was the opposite of the impression.

Kevin beheld the sudden apparent materialization of that staff, and
a look of wonder came onto his haggard face. He continued to watch
as that staff, seemingly all by itself, began to trace a
counterspell. And as the syllables appeared in the air, I began to
pronounce them, at first as softly as the rustling of a butterfly's
wing. Then as I continued to enunciate my words, syllable by
syllable, the volume of my voice continued gradually to rise.

At first they remained unaware of me, although I was making no
effort at all to escape their notice. The sorcerers, though, could
not keep up their pace. They began to lag, and gradually it started
to dawn on them that this lagging must be due to an external
influence.

However, just before all but one of them began to consider searching
for the source of this opposition, I activated the first of my major
magical movements in this confrontation. Completely concealed behind
a cloaking spell of enormous power, my two fellow wizards fed me
more of their own life force. This joined with that projected by my
ring.

Instantly, a great ray of light, as white as snow, as swift as
lightning, surged out straight at the flickering sphere of energy
protecting Kevin. It struck that bubble before the startled gaze of
the black cloaked sorcerers and, at once, the Terran inside it was
gone. For a moment, a residue of the energy field remained as an
after image to tantalize the eyes. Then even this faded away and
only an empty space remained within the ring of trees.

My bolt had carried Kevin to a place of refuge several blocks away.
They could, of course, easily pursue him. However, it was unlikely
they would do so before they dealt with me. This match had only
begun. I mentally prepared myself for the moves which were still to
come. I braced myself to meet the scrutiny of these powerful and
determined sorcerers. I tensed in anticipation of their undoubtedly
displeased response to my intervention.

One of them, perhaps more talented or alert than his fellows,
perhaps because a certain talisman guided him, had started to turn
to look out past the trees, past the green bubble of energy and the
adept it guarded, at the precise instant I had acted to rescue the
Earthman. At once his eyes had struck my advancing form. A moment
passed. Now with their quarry suddenly removed from their encircling
clutches, they were all coming to a halt and turning to confront me.

"Fool, fool and thrice a fool," came the rasping telepathy of the
talisman, quite displeased with its underlings.

This did not foster any benevolence on their part towards me. Such
frustration and fury rode their eyes as could never disfigure the
countenance of any normal human, nay, not even one far along the
left hand path.

"Knowest thou not that since our operation hath been interrupted
fully twenty four hours must transpire before it may be attempted
once more. And where will we find so appropriate a victim?"

"Master," croaked the leader of that sorcerous crew, "what about
that one, the defiler of our lofty incantations? Maybe we can use
him as a substitute."

"Nay," projected the talisman. "He shall serve as a sacrifice this
very night to open a different portal. He is but a dabbler native to
this world. Slay him with the force of your will and thought."

They hurled at me, the cause of their frustration, such a bolt of
pure hatred that had I been only a normal man I would have crumpled
to the ground, my life force withered and my body reduced to ashes.
Yet, I, to their complete amazement, continued to stand and appeared
to be affected not at all.

"Who art thou? How darest thou disturb the most important task in
the universes?" projected the talisman to me. The one who had it on
his person howled those dark inhuman syllables aloud in his inhuman
guttarals, exactly as a beast of the night might howl at the shining
and wholesome light of the moon.

"Slay him with the horn sword," commanded the talisman.

He who had been the first to notice me, he who bore the talisman,
acted at once. He drew from a scaly scabbard beneath his black cloak
a long black sword, carved from the horn of a beast no less a
predator than the one which had provided his cloak. No doubt this
sword had been intended for the proper place in the sacrificial
ritual they planned to offer after they had successfully overcome
Kevin. Now, seeing that he was no longer here, that I was still
alive after their potent mental blast and that I was continuing to
advance on them while proceeding with my magical actions, seemingly
paying no heed to them or their telepathic talisman, he prepared a
more immediate application of this sinister weapon, one scarcely
less pleasing to him than his original intention.

As I walked slowly, steadily, irresistibly towards them, I began
chanting certain runes of light, which one would expect only the
most accomplished of the adepts of this planet to possess and know
how to use. As I did so, my staff traced those runes in the air.
They continued to hang there a few feet above the ground, blazing
gold and silver in the night.

From the expressions that now began to appear on the faces of my
adversaries, it was clear that my ruse was successful. They made no
effort to shield their thoughts from me. Indeed, they gloated in
letting me read those ghastly cogitations. I was in their estimation
a fool, who imagined that simply because I had picked up a minuscule
smattering of learning on this magically deprived and ignorant
world, that I could contend with them.

Were they not, their thoughts came to me, among the most skilled and
competent sorcerers in the galaxy? Were they not among the most
favoured servants of their real ruler, the master of the master of
the talismanic master who commanded them here? Was their ruler not
such an emperor of darkness as humans with their paltry imaginations
could never conceive? Here, clearly they projected at me their
disdain at the Terran concept of Satan. They flung the visual at me
of the stereotypical tailed and cloved footed prince of devils
prostrate before an enormous throne of darkest adamant. Him they
served had the real right to the homage due a high king of the
demons, even if humans lacked the mental capacity to imagine him.

While much of what they were so eager to share with me was just an
aspect of their confrontation with me, an attempt to weaken my
conviction that I had any chance of prevailing over them, there was
more than a grain of truth in what they were thinking at me. I knew
more than they guessed just how close to the truth was the
information they thought they were passing on to a human opponent
for the first time.

As a deep bubbling spring I felt the energy flowing into my psychic
form from my two fellow wizards. This gave me the strength to
continue the illusion that I was alone and only now finding out
about the existence, let alone the superiority, of sorcerers and
demons from other worlds. Ah, if we could only pull this off. How
much more devastating would it appear to these sorcerers, their
immediate talismanic overlord and their demonic ruler for these nine
to be overcome by a single human being. I nipped that thought in the
bud. It permitted uncertainty, and therein resides the initial step
on the path to magical defeat.

I came to a halt about four metres from the closest of them. The
satanists, or rather the creatures more vile than satanists, moved
to stand beside each other, so that they formed a solid line between
me and the closest of the trees. They stood there, their malevolent
thoughts flickering no less balefully than the combined deadly glow,
vegetable and mineral, they now turned towards me.

I could read their mental intentions quite clearly, far more clearly
than they imagined, since they knew no reason to shield the deeper
levels of their minds from a mere Terran. First, they would chant,
in a minor key so to speak, the kind of conjuration, which I had
interrupted, and, if they could not, tonight, obtain the means of
entrance into this finite and physical realm by the emperor of the
demons, they could at least obtain the presence here of one of that
mighty monarch's chief ministers. And, of course, in place of the
body and soul of Kevin they would have my being, material and
spiritual, to offer that demonic noble.

Now the sword bearer began to implement that intention. He brought
his unholy blade up to his forehead. He gently knicked the skin. A
drop of black blood trickled down to touch the point of his horn
blade. That blood hissed and steamed up into the night air. Had I
only the physical sight of an Earthman, I would not have noticed
that steam, so I allowed no indication to be read in my features or
surface thoughts that I was aware of it. This black blood which
steamed ultraviolet on contact with the Terran atmosphere only
confirmed my suspicion that these sorcerers came from the same
world as their cloaks and carnivorous phosphorescent stocks. This
meant, however vile they were, they were at least inhabitants of
this dimension, though what they were attempting to attract was not.

The swordbearer stretched out his weapon in my direction. Then he
took a step towards me. His eyes were blazing with anger, or was it
merely anger? Who can presume to know the emotions that surge across
the hearts and souls of the servants of the lord of darkness?

His lips came apart and emitted a sibilant hiss. "Again, intruder, I
demand that thou speakest and informest me concerning thy purpose in
protruding into a place, where thou hast no right to be, and why
thou concernest thyself with that, which is no business of thine." I
couldn't tell whether he thought this independently or whether he
was merely reflecting the thoughts of the talisman which had fallen
completely silent, at least as far as my psychic ears could discern.

For an instant, I just stood there, staring back at him. I figured
it was best not to play his game, but to continue, exactly along the
path upon which I had resolved from the start. With the help of the
others, and drawing exactly on the precise spell I knew would be the
best defense against their next move which they had so recklessly
broadcast, I prepared myself to meet the thrust of that far from
ordinary sword.

My composure must surely have startled that servant of the master of
the Pit. It could not compare with the astonishment in store. First,
I opened my mouth, and began to intone the most powerful enchantment
known on Earth. If he recognized it, he gave no sign of that, though
he did flinch just a bit, as if he found those most melodious words
somewhat disquieting.

As I continued to pronounce those so healthy syllables, the sorcerer
wielding the horn sword began uttering sounds of his own, "Magan han
la manahaz zoon ih vanol..."

Very, very faintly, barely more audible than the flapping of the
wings of a butterfly, a hundred metres away, came a thought from the
Wizard of Blue, far away inside the sheltered recess of my mind,
beyond the perception of our opponents, "Protectorate 137.3. I'll do
it in Latin." She had indicated a tricky and complicated magical
operation. It required too much of my concentration. I knew I could
not assist in this and retain the shield concealing the existence of
the others. I dared the microsecond weakening of that shield to
communicate that to her.

A full half second elapsed, as swirled around and within my mind the
consideration of my assertion and its ramifications, as well as half
a hundred alternatives. At the end of that time the Wizard of Orange
spoke their decision, "Waiting; proceed, Green, to actualize your
resolved potential."

I gave a mental nod, as I felt my power building, and could tell
they were freely throwing all their own energy to me, keeping barely
enough in reserve to remain alive. And this came none too soon.

The swordbearer, who had not halted his unearthly intonations, took
another step. His alien weapon started to shimmer blackly with more
than reflected light. This sword was no concealing device as was the
case with my illusionary staff. He held the real item. Also, in a
manner similar to the way my fellow wizards were focusing their
psychic energy on me, his fellow sorcerers, but so far as I could
tell not the talisman, were directing their energy into the sword. I
could sense the paths by which they fed it.

I could also feel exactly how they intended their energy to combine
with the totality of my life force, my completely vanquished
essence, to open the portal permitting the chief minister of the
Lord of the Pit to enter this dimension.

Holding the tremendously intricate and complex image of the step by
step interception and conversion of that energy, conceptualizing the
transformation of each erg of malevolent potential to an erg of
precise kinetic reality, I hurled my illusionary staff at the
concretely real sword.

I had timed my throw perfectly. It looked exactly as if I'd been
almost adept enough to read his mind, and know the timing of his
stroke. For, at the very instant I had tossed my staff to intercept
him, he had with a steady hand thrust that baleful blade forward.
The staff came, as I intended barely a centimetre short of striking
that sword.

I allowed a look combining exactly the correct mix of supreme
disappointment, determination and resignation to flicker across my
face. I could clearly perceive the feeling of triumph and
expectation emanating from the chief sorcerer in front of me.

My illusionary staff exploded in a spectacular display of
pyrotechnics, and, I could feel the humorous relief on the part of
my enemies that the full impact of that explosion was directed back
at me, the one who had hurled the staff. This return of the force of
that explosion upon its originator had a theoretical plausibility
that made them all the more accepting of my ploy.

It was perhaps two thirds of a second after the explosion of that
guileful staff, and the apparent spraying of its magical force
across my form that the unearthly sword arrived to penetrate my body
and also my spirit. First, came his gloating triumphal thought that
he was too close to miss and there was nothing I could do to keep
the weapon from me, reeling as I was from the effects of the
explosion.

He lunged forward, determined to plunge his weapon completely
through my torso. And, of course, as I had planned it, I felt nary a
thing. The blaze, as bright and apparently as harmful as lightning,
of the explosion flickered across my body and then seemed to be
grounded out. The horn sword seemed clearly driven into me almost to
the hilt. My adversary, standing barely a metre from me, wore a look
of complete exultation as he extracted, as he supposed, his sword
from my form.

How quickly that expression was replaced by one of incredulity and
then of apprehension. The sword had not touched me. I had not
allowed it to touch me. Instead, under cover of the apparent
destruction of my staff, I had used my ring to convert most of the
material substance of that sword to potential energy, storing some
within the matrix of my ring and sending some down deep through the
well of my being to my two colleagues.

The rest at once I used as kinetic psychic energy, causing it to
streak along the one hundred and twenty first interdimensional path,
the very path along which the major demon was to access this spot.
It would not do so now.

The swordbearer lacked the psychic ability or awareness to realize
anything else except that I was alive and his master's minister had
failed to arrive. He stepped back. He was holding what he still
possessed of the sword, the hilt and about five centimetres beyond.
The rest of it, that part of the weapon, which ought to have
penetrated my body, the body of a wizard, was gone. From his
perspective it had simply vanished.

I allowed a trace of humour to come into my eyes. I allowed the
thought to form in my mind, unspoken, though one they could read
clearly, that perhaps this was not a planet so poor in magical
attainment. They were not amused.

"Zhoovash san hamon donahor zhan," began the hilt bearer as he
backed up to rejoin his fellow sorcerers. I was puzzled that again I
could not detect whether he originated these sounds or reflected the
telepathic utterances of the talisman. It was quite effectively
concealing itself from me.

I could clearly tell that the sorcerers were attempting a defensive
spell. They made no effort to hide that fact. And once again I was
being allowed access to their thoughts, or at least to some of them,
in the hope that this would provide for my own undoing. They had by
no means given up hopes of taking me out by offensive action. What
they intended was to lull me into a false sense of security and
superiority, after which they would launch an unexpected attack that
was also to have a surprising nature.

I responded, exactly as they had expected, by going back to my
recitation of the most potent magical spell known on Earth.

"Quick," shouted the talisman's chief servant here. "Form a circle."
The others leaped to obey. In no time they stood once again in a
circle. He shouted another order and they began, carefully, to
bring the phosphorescent stocks together. I could read their thought
that this was tricky, as it demanded some concentration and will
power to compel two such powerful and highly territorial plants to
come into physical contact with each other. Yet, once implemented,
by all nine of them, they would present me with an absolutely
impenetrable barrier. It was a thought intended to prod me into a
rash act.

Before they could complete their design, I made as if drawing on all
my power, like a gambler staking his all in one final throw. I
carved a glyph in the air, demonstrating that I was a human adept of
uncommon magical capacity. Forming out of the air, but ten
centimetres from my hand was a staff, exactly the same in appearance
as the one, which had been lost when I had tossed it at the horn
sword. I could read that they were impressed by that demonstration
of my skill. Also, something they wished to keep concealed from me
was a thought connected with the build up of their psychic power. I
could tell that they were readying something, and they did not want
me to have any information as to what it was.

The one clutching the hilt waved it at me and snarled. Into my mind
popped the picture of a squat scaly creature attempting to leap over
a boiling pool of lava. He was trying to convey the false impression
that he was being reckless himself, when the whole thing was a ploy
for some other move.

"Dost thou imagine that thou alone hast the ability to conjure a
staff out of thin air?" he snarled in his native language. "Behold,
fool, the power of ultramundane magic." He flung his hilt aside and
with an exaggerated flourish of his hands he drew from the air a
shimmering staff of light that made mine seem but a lifeless piece
of wood. With a second jerking of his right hand his staff shone not
with white, but with black light.

At once, all the phosphorescent stocks wilted and dulled. At once,
all the writhing serpentine characters on the sorcerous cloaks
disappeared. At once, the hunks of radium upon their heads were
gone, largely teleported into the sun, though some of those atoms
were converted to energy, permitting this display of my power and
replenishing my life force and that of my two fellow wizards.
