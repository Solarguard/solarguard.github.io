<center>THE BOOK OF OGHAM</center><p>

Edred Thorsson, Llewellyn, St. Paul, 1992<p>

This handbook on Celtic ogham divination is the one that has the most
personal resonance for me. The author, of course, is better known for
his work with the Nordic runes, and I like what he has done with the
ogham.<p>

His first chapter takes a look at the ogham letters, original and
supplementary forfeda, at historical and mythic concepts concerning the
origins of the alphabet, at the uses of ogham as a system of
classification, as memorial records and in medieval manuscripts.<p>

His second chapter considers the connection between the oghamic and the
runic systems. He notes that these represent different spiritual
traditions from that founded on the Phoenician or Hebrew alphabets. He
cites a reference to runes in AURAICEPT NA NECES (THE SCHOLAR'S PRIMER).
He mentions similarities and contrasts between the oghamic and runic
systems.<p>

His third chapter using the concept of the fifths, four dimensions plus
the centre, explores Celtic cosmology. There follow some general remarks
on divination and then some comments on the topic as it applies
particularly within a Celtic framework.<p>

His fourth chapter looks at Celtic psychology in the framework of seven
distinct psychological states.<p>

His fifth chapter considers the means of casting the oghamic fews. This
includes comments on preparing the fews and cloth, if one is used, and
on getting in an appropriate frame of mind for the divination. He then
considers different methods of divining with the fews. This includes the
threefold layout, the fivefold layout, casting on the fifths, extending
the fifths to ninths, etc.<p>

Next comes his letter by letter consideration. This includes remarks on
the tree whose name is the name of the letter, on deities and heroes
corresponding to the letter, divinatory meaning, a professional
correspondence for the letter and a defining word for the letter in each
of the five fifths of Celtic cosmography.<p>

There are appendices providing tables of correspondences, the alphabet
of Nemnivus and the pronunciation of Old Irish.<p>

It is hoped that in future this site will contain carefully considered
remarks on the divinatory attribution of each of the ogham letters. This
may well include considerations of the attributions provided by Thorsson
and others. For now, avoiding any debate on the palaeopagan application
of the ogham in divination, I will say that, in general, Thorsson's
attributions and many of his other remarks in this book have a very
strong personal resonance for me.<p>
