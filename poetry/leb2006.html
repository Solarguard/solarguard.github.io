Lebanon July 2006

How write when bleeds the land that taught us how?
How pray with places sacred burning now?
How live when planes are hurling doom and death?
Yet hope endures until a final breath.

Elders recall a song about the birds
And yearn to learn it wasn't only words,
That war will halt and people greet a peace
At last to stay and never ever cease.

Michael McKenny, July 23, 2006 C.E.
