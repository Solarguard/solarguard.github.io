<h2>The Dragon King's Daughter, Ten T'ang Dynasty Stories</h2>

transl. Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang, Foreign Languages Press, Beijing, 1980 (1954)<p>

<p>This is a fascinating glimpse of T'ang Dynasty short fiction, a
precursor to the powerful novels inspired in later centuries.

<p>Here is a rich variety of interesting, marvellous and moving material.
Here is the story of the White Monkey and the tale of the fox fairy Ren.
Here is the story of "The Man With the Curly Beard" who turns out to be
no ordinary guy, and here is "Wushuang the Peerless." Here is that very
curious account of "The Governor of the Southern Tributary State" which
some have seen as a criticism of the life and concerns of the scholar
official. And, here is that quite touching "Story of a Singsong Girl."
Surely one of the most poignant images in fiction is that of this love
struck hero, nursed back to health by the undertakers, singing so
effectively in the dirge competition.

<p>This exquisite little book has attractive illustrations and a map of the
T'ang capital, Ch'ang An. The romantic and imaginative tales it contains
are highly recommended.<p>
