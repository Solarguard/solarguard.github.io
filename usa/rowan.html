Rowan, Greetings!

On November 9, 2008 C.E. we gather to welcome you arrived to life only
a few months ago. Our gifts are good wishes and spiritual blessings.
Here are mine. By the time you are able to read this with meaningful
understanding, this old body may not remain. The good wishes last as
long as the human species exists.

1. I present my apology. I am sorry that I was here such a long time
and was as unsuccessful as I have been in leaving you a world worthy of
you.

2. I present free will. The world into which you are born is filled 
with advertising and propaganda based on the premise that humans may be
programmed to do what is in the interest of the programmers. They have
little significant respect for people. I provide my assurance that each
human is able to perceive, consider and act freely. One can choose to
avoid such propaganda. One can see it for what it is. One can decide to
do what is beneficial for humanity.

3. I present evolution. A dominant philosophy of this age is that the
human species is programmed at birth, a scientific original sin. For
example, Robert Ardrey in "African Genesis" writes: "No child of ours,
born in the middle twentieth century, can differ at birth in
significant measure from the earliest of Homo sapiens. No instinct,
whether physiological or cultural, that constituted a part of the
original human bundle can ever in the history of the species be
permanently suppressed or abandoned." (p. 14)

This author examines scientific research into human, humanoid, other
Terran animal behaviour explaining such characteristics as
territoriality, contention and domination. A less scientific, though
equally assertive statement is that change cannot be expected because
"That's the way things are." I present to you the assessment that those
enjoying the advantages of an imbalanced society and those seeking
justification for submitting to or perpetuating such a society employ
such spirit paralyzing propaganda to excuse inexcusable behaviour.

An examination of human history, anthropology and spirituality confirms
that there are balancing human characteristics to the negative ones so
stridently insisted upon. Only a few days ago, a major effort was made
towards changing the course of human history, an effort exemplified by
the refrain, "Yes we can!" Whatever the actual results of that energy
for change, I present the assurance that the human species can evolve. 

4. I present awareness. As the above illuminates, often a specific way
is advertised as the only way. Often, when other ways are admitted,
they are advertised as inferior, even inimical. As I understand present
human reality, much of the dominant culture may be traced to successful
Renaissance attitudes. George Bull, in his introduction to the Penguin
translation of volume two of Vasari's Lives, mentions some of these:
"humanist, mercantile, religious, courtly, and competitive." (p. xix)
Many modern humans residing within, or oppressed by, the prevailing
society are not aware of such roots, nor of their particular nature.
The Renaissance was not absolutely negative and, despite the high
esteem in which many hold it, it was not absolutely positive. For
example, competition, so keenly promoted by certain influential
individuals and groups, is actually a fundamental aspect of humanity's
diseased condition.

Perception enables the perceiver to realize the nature of what exists
as part of the process of deciding what to do. A large part of such
perceiving is seeing past the advertising, very alert to the truth that
such novels as 1984 and We, an inspirational source of 1984, apply as
much to the propaganda of the Western powers that be as it does to
previous regimes in the East. 

5. I present moderation. A key aspect of walking a path through life is
to avoid both extremes and stay on the path.

6. I present humanity. The human species is a single species. The human
people are one people. The human homeworld is one small planet. Europe
several centuries ago witnessed the emergence of nationalist movements
and the establishment of nation states. These were often based upon a
common language. Europeans exported this concept of the nation state to
other areas of the world. Even the artificial creations of colonies in
Africa achieved independence and, retaining to a great extent borders
imposed by European colonizers, became nation states. Pan Africanism
exists; some national leaders in Africa have sought an African nation.
Transcending even the European Union and the African Union is the human
nation.

This concept is natural and every advertizing campaign against it very
suspect. Those who are adept at playing the game of divide and conquer,
those whose positions of power and personal prejudices tempt them into
perpetuating human segmentation, may be perceived for what they are. At
whatever time, in whichever generation, individuals appear attempting
to rekindle the flames of human division, their negativity may be seen
for what it is.

One of the most insightful human teachings, in my opinion, is that evil
has no positive existence. Exactly as darkness merely defines the non
existence of light and poverty the non existence of wealth, evil is a
word defining the non existence of good. These people inciting humans
to contend against each other may be viewed as satanic. However, in my
opinion, it is more civilized to consider them as unwell or unwise, as
deprived. The important point is that all efforts to divide humanity be
seen for the darkness they truly are.

7. I present you the healer's ideal. The ideal healing remedy is one
effective regardless of the cause of the malady. It is clear to any
unbiased observer that the greatest disease afflicting humanity is
division. The most pronounced symptoms of this disease are the savage
wars staining the honour of the species.

Whatever the cause of these wars, of this human segmentation: if it is
personal and group greed, prejudice, lust for leadership, mindless
obedience, vested interest, perpetuation of powerful anachronistic
organizations (NATO, for example), even if some astonishing conspiracy
theory be confirmed and a secret corps of psychics or a hidden band of
aliens be revealed deliberately seeking to continue human division, the
ideal remedy is the recognition by all humans that they are one nation.

This awareness, even I consider it this attainment of the intelligence
of the species, judging until then humans are not an intelligent
species, may have specific aspects in varying cultures. For example, in
Chinese the concept of "Central" is central. Often less adequately
translated as "Middle," the Chinese viewpoint is China is the "Central"
land, Chinese culture, the Central culture, etc. Now, Chinese have long
perceived the planets as "Water Star", "Metal Star," "Fire Star," "Wood
Star" and "Earth Star" (this last actually Saturn) and more recently
from Western astronomy "Heavenly King's Star" and "Sea King's Star."
Within Chinese culture, I suggest that using the term "Central Star"
for humanity's homeworld clearly conveys the concept that humans are
one people. A balanced awareness by all of humanity's achievements in
China is one aspect of human consciousness.

The great religions teach God created humanity; science teaches humans
are one species, by definition. Human history contains examples that
communities of ever increasing size and complexity were established. It
is, therefore, reasonably a continuation of this evolutionary community
building capacity for the Central Planet, the human homeworld to emerge
from potential into kinetic actualization. I present to you the human
homeworld, the ideal remedy.

8. I present hospitality to you. Moderation will allow humans to stay
on the path, avoiding excessive human nationalism either against other
species upon this planet, or against any visitors who may come from
beyond this planet. Hospitality at the individual level receives guests
worthily and behaves worthily when visiting. Hospitality at the species
level enables humans at home, or away from home, to interact worthily
with those of other species. Avoiding extremes of subservience and of
domination, avoiding competition and conflict, humanity may co-exist as
one strand in the tapestry of life.

9. I present to you ancestral good will. By the time you can read this
in any meaningful sense, these fingers that typed it may very well not
exist. The spirit is eternal. Ancestors wish the living well.

Thrice Three Blessings,

Red aka Michael McKenny
