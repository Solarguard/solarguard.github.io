Prehistoric India, Stuart Piggott, Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1952 (1950)

This British archaeologist, author of The Druids (Penguin 1968) and
Ancient Europe (Aldine 1979, 1965), introduces the English reader to
archaeological discoveries beyond Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. The book
examines material from the palaeolithic to c. 1,000 BCE. It outlines
the development of agriculture, founding, growth and demise of towns
and cities and the arrival of Western invaders.

This inadequate beginning hopefully will evolve into a fuller summary
by Michael McKenny before the New Year.
