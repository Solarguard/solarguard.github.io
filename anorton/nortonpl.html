AN ENUMERATION OF THE PLANETS NAMED IN THE GALACTIC STORIES OF ANDRE 
NORTON. Version Lughnasad 2001 CE, updated on July 9, 2003 CE with 
additions from BEAST MASTER'S ARK, in August 2005 with additions
from BEAST MASTER'S CIRCUS, August 2006 with a few additions from
the Moon of Three Rings series and August 2007 with additions from 
BEAST MASTER'S QUEST.

An earlier version of this list appeared in APAPLEXY LX on December 
9, 1989 CE. Also, that version or one modified from it, may have 
appeared in cyberspace in the mid 90s. Unlike the numbering system 
used in those versions, this one numbers each series, with the books 
inside a series assigned smaller case letters according to their 
sequence in the series. An improvement now is that referenced page 
numbers are provided for those planets on which the story transpires 
(gaps in page numbering indicate action offworld) and at least one 
page reference for each other world mentioned or alluded to in the 
text. Also a preliminary attempt is now made to provide contextual 
reference to some adjectival names and propernouns. This includes an 
initial effort at astronomical data, such as the number of moons on a 
few planets listed. Although this list is a significant upgrade from 
what was published in 1989, it is very unlikely that it is now 
complete and absolutely correct. I would be very grateful for any 
additions and corrections brought to my attention.
