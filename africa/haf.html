History of Africa, Kevin Shillington, St. Martin's Press, New York,
1995 (1985)

1. Africa appears to be the home continent of the human species. Here
evolved humanity.

2. Agriculture and pastoralism spread across Africa. In the northeast,
in the valley of the Nile, flourished the millennia long civilization
of Egypt, marked by its divine pharaohs and their spectacular concern
for an afterlife. From c. 3100 to c. 1100 B.C.E. twenty dynasties
reigned across Old, Middle and New Kingdoms. Ten more ruled down to
Alexander and Ptolemy.

3. Iron surpassed other metals. From c. 1500 to 1000 B.C.E. Egypt had
directly ruled much of Nubia, exerting great cultural influence. Kush
grew strong afterwards, from c. 730-670 ruling Egypt. Later the Kushite
capital moved from Napata to Meroe. Iron enhanced Meroe's timber,
agriculture, hunting and defence. Meroe traded north to Egypt, east to
the Red Sea. Its prosperity increased during the Graeco-Roman period.

Meroe long continued Egyptian cultural influences, including pyramids
and hieroglyphics. Meroitic language and "a flowing alphabetic-type
script" later were used. Apedemic (lion god) joined Amun. Soon after
300 C.E. Meroes ascendency ended.Axum rose. Phoenicians traded with
and settled in North Africa. Carthage extended trade across the
Saharah and down the Atlantic Coast with West Africa. From c. 450 BCE
iron existed in Nigeria, etc. Nok (near modern Taruga) flourished.

4. Iron use spread widely, possibly through the movement of Bantu
speaking peoples. There may have been two (western and eastern) or
three (central) streams of iron transmission with possibly considerable
interweaving. Bananas and Asian yams brought by Southeast Asians c. 100
C.E. spread quickly, supplementing sorghum, millet, beans, etc. Cattle
rearing (in tsetse fly free areas) and hunting added significantly to
food.

5. Ptolemaic Egypt, then Rome traded extensively; Egyptian grain fed
many. Rome replaced Carthage and absorbed North Africa, another source
of grain. Christianity spread in North Africa. Axum, perhaps greatly
influenced by Arabian Saba, rose southeast of Meroe. Islam rose. Trade
shifted more to the Persian Gulf. Islam spread across North Africa,
eventually overcoming Byzantine and Berber resistence.

6. The camel, introduced to North Africa early in the Christian era,
permitted greater trade across the Saharah. Such trade fostered the
impressive growth and flourishing of ancient Ghana, geographically
northwest of modern Ghana. Arabic writings speak highly of this long
lasting state. Others existed, though less well documented.

7. Muslim Berbers c. 1050 seized northern and southern trans Saharan
trading points. Ghana's rulers converted. Islam extended literacy in
North and West Africa. Muslims were pushed back in Spain; Portugal in
1415 took Ceuta in North Africa. Impressive Mali arose. Mansa Musa's
pilgrimage to Mecca (1324-1325) manifested his wealth and power. Ibn
Battuta in 1352 visited Mali and was very impressed. Dynastic disputes
and raids from north and south weakened the Empire. Songhay rose. Sonni
Ali (1464-1492), never defeated in battle, founded the Empire which
Muhammad Ture (1493-1528) consolidated. Leo Africanus visited in 1510
and 1513 and left a glowing report.

8. Independent Fatimid Egypt reinvigorated Red Sea trade. Christian
Ethiopia expanded, absorbing mercentile Islamic states in the interior.
The rulers of one such state fell back, formed a stronger power base
and contended with Ethiopia. Muslims in the late 1520s, armed with
Turkish firearms, inflicted a severe defeat on Ethiopia. South in
Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, iron smelting was long practised. Felling
trees reduced the area of the tsetse fly. Cattle use increased.

9. From Classical times East African traded with the Persian Gulf and
West India. Islamic traders fostered the growth of ports. Al Masudi
visited East Africa in 916 C.E. Kiswahili (a Bantu language with Arabic
words) became predominate and literate in coastal towns. Portugese in
1498 arrived, attacked East African ports and established bases.

10. Central and Southern Africa likely saw greater continuity between
Early and Later Iron Age populations than once thought. Gold and Copper
were traded. Cattle raising communities flourished. Great Zimbabwe was
built from c. 1200 to 1450, trading gold and ivory to Kilwa port. In
the 1530s, Portugese struck up the Zambesi. In 1571 and 1574 Portugese
made unsuccessful attempts to seize Zimbabwe successor states. In
southern Africa Khoisan hunter gatherers were pushed to drier areas by
Bantu speakers growing grain and raising cattle.

11. Many Arabs moved to North Africa in the late Eleventh Century. In
Egypt Fatimids repaired dams and canals, increased crop production and
revived trade. Saladin repelled European Crusaders from Egypt, restored
Sunni Islam, reinvigorated Cairo. Advances continued under the Mamluks.
Gold and emeralds were mined east of Aswan. Red Sea trade expanded. The
Ottomans in 1517 took Egypt. Islam spread up the Nile. In 1317 Dongola
Cathedral became a mosque. Cattle raising peoples moved from the south
into Ethiopia. Ottomans reached into the Maghrib, repelling European
encroachment. Independent Morocco defeated Portugese and conquered
Songhay.

12. Portugese in the Fifteenth Century began sailing down the West
Coast. A slave manned plantation system (originally using European
Slavic slaves) was introduced to Principe and Sao Tomaso using Africans
for labour. This system was brought to newly discovered America. Over
centuries millions of Africans were transported to slave labour in
America.
