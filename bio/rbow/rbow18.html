Chapter Eighteen Home

"Shall we dance again," projected Violet.

"With pleasure," I replied.

I could sense her pleasure. I realized the others were smiling
mentally. 

"I perceive that we are agreed." projected Blue.

So with rising excitement I joined in this last sweep around the
globe. We moved in a westerly direction, as moves the sun. As I
watched the vast curve of the distant horizon appear to spin
rapidly, very intently I scanned mentally, psychically for any trace
of extraterrestrial magic or occult influence. There was none, nor
did Violet or any of the other three wizards who moved along with us
detect anything either.

"The waves are clear for fish," projected Yellow, using an image
from her own language. I saw the visual of a vast expanse of sea
void of predators and cleansed of any impurities threatening to
fish. I sensed the rest of us agreeing with that. We all rejoiced,
and none more keenly than I. Not only was Earth confirmed secure,
but the way now seemed clear for me to check out the Tower of Green.

For a final moment we hovered in the pleasant air above the Alps,
where there no longer was a terminal of an interdimensional passage.
We sent out our best wishes to our colleague, who was to remain
here.

"May the Light shine upon you and illumine your way," offered Blue.

"I'm grateful to you," I projected to Orange, "for letting me go
home." And strangely enough it did feel as though I were looking
forward to a homecoming, and not venturing to an alien planet.

"Think nothing of it," replied Orange and I could feel his smile.

"Be careful," projected Violet.

"You need not worry about that," replied Orange.

"I'll await your regular messages," projected Yellow.

"And I'll look forward to sending them," projected Orange.

The fresh Swiss mountain air seemed redolent with the spirit of our
well-wishing. Then, suddenly he was gone, or rather we were. We four
had formed the teleportation spell in our minds and activated it.

We arrived back on the proper day, six minutes later than when we
had left the Council chamber, only we were outside in the glade,
close to the Pool of Tears. Red and Indigo were waiting for us,
keenly catching up on all that had taken place, agreeing with our
decisions and extending their benediction for my sojourn to my
tower. I expressed my appreciation, finding it hard to concentrate
in this aboreal setting from which arose that unpretentious Rainbow
Tower, seat of a Council ancient when Earthmen dwelt in caves, and
possessing actual power beyond the imagination of the most
egocentric of Terran dictators.

I could feel the over-arching and ever present high forest, so many
leaves and trees within the planetary telepathic Internet. I was
inundated by a multitude of impressions concerning the details of
life here, and even much data on other planets within the
Federation. Some people wished to add to their trees my views on the
similarities and differences between Earth and the various other
worlds within the Federation, though the Greek word Oikoumene arose
within my mind as a more exact translation. It was all overwhelming.

"Well, ring," I thought, "this seems like your time to answer some
questions."

"Indigo," Violet projected.

However, the elder had already noticed my condition. A flashing
indigo leaf appeared upon the appropriate trees. This leaf sang
softly and very sweetly, "He grows as grows a normal growing tree."
Then it spoke about the need to allow the new Green his natural time
to grow into the ways of this world and of the Oikoumene.

"Don't worry," she projected to me. "None of us could provide them
with the detailed answers they're seeking. We have been focused
until now on the doings of our world. And, you need your traditional
first night undisturbed within your tower. I'll shield you from the
high forest while you grow."

"Thank you," I replied.

"Farewell," she projected.

"Best wishes, Green," projected Violet.

"Goodbye," I projected.

The others sent their farewells. I took my leave, and with a brush
of my hand through the air, as habitual to the Wizard of Green
almost as breathing, I swiftly appeared at the entrance to my tower.

The first thing I encountered on arriving was the memory of my
previous visit. A faint breeze wafted to my nostrils the scent of
the leaves of a small grove of mountain trees, stirring remembrance
of the ceremony for my predecessor. The wind was carrying his ashes
throughout the mountain skies and across the planet.

"Oh, Green," I projected. "Wherever you are now, thrive."

The next thing that thrust itself upon my attention was the
doorkeeper. There came a melodious query. "Is a visitor arriving to
call upon the Wizard of Green?"

For an instant I hesitated. Then, with a smile, I answered, "No, I
guess not. This is the new Wizard of Green. I've come home."

"Welcome home. I hope you will be as pleased with me as you were
before."

I smiled at the carving in the door of a creature something like an
eagle. It was from the beak of this that the sonorous sounds had
come. I answered her, speaking what was in my heart. "You, old
friend, have never given the Wizard of Green cause for complaint. I
doubt that I'll find any in the future."

I could sense that she was pleased. "I shall be as happy to announce
your guests as I've always been," she said. This was scarcely an
onorous task. When one lives in a remote spot this cuts down
considerably on the number of people who come calling. I thought
then of the Tibetan proverb which I had stumbled on in my reading,
which said that in such a situation only one's closest friends and
deadliest enemies would come visiting. In the case of the Wizard of
Green, it was very rare for anyone other than my fellow wizards to
arrive at my tower. In the distant past, before telepathy had become
so universal and formed the pattern of the high forest, some of those
very rare visitors had brought tidings or appeals for assistance
that had resulted in deeds, which adorn the pages of our history.

The massive wooden door swung open before me. I entered, treading
softly on the ages old stone floor beyond. The floor, as the walls
of the tower, had come from the ruins of a dozen ancient southern
structures of special significance. I was aware of my ring's fond
recognition of each of them and its recollection of the long and
stirring stories which they contained.

Immediately beyond the door lay a small entrance chamber. The
curved lintel above the doorway bore the carved emerald words,
"Welcome, Friends." Above it was an invisible rune, which was meant
to ensure that it really was only friends who proceeded any further
into the tower. Actually, in the long history of this place, no
opponent of Light had ever made it past the doorkeeper.

I walked through the entrance chamber into the main room of the
ground floor. This served as a combined reception room for visitors,
kitchen and dining room and even an exercise area, when the Wizard
of Green practices calllisthenics. To my immediate right, as I came
in the room was the stairway leading down into the store rooms,
below ground level.

The room was furnished as needed at the moment. Right now, it had a
table with a single simple chair before it. I bowed, raised my right
hand and sketched a glyph in the air. A round bluish fruit appeared
on the table. I sat down in one of the chairs.

I gazed mentally at the physical form of the delicious waterberry in
front of me. I lifted it slowly in my right hand and uttered the
very ancient verse, "I honour thee, giver of life to me." Then
slowly I let my tongue run over the tasty fruit. Slowly my teeth bit
and began to chew. There passed through my mind diagrams showing the
complexity of the chemical structure of the food. Then my thoughts
followed the future of each beneficial atom and its absorption into
this human body. If there was a pressing need, I could speed up that
process, but this was a relaxed moment, so I didn't interfere,
merely observed what it was I ate and what were the positive
consequences for my body in the normal passage of time. It was an
awesome way to eat.

When I had finished eating, I rose, bowed again, in thanks to the
waterberry and to the god who had created it. I moved slowly and
humbly over to a small room on my right. It was empty at the moment,
as was the room beside it. I smiled at memories of the past and
visions of the future showing these rooms more than empty. I went
forward to the stairway leading to the middle level.

Each of the steps of that stairway had come from one of the eleven
towers of the Protectorate of the First Empire, or from the Tower of
Erissa on the island of Zih-han. On each of them was a mark
indicating the place of origin. I didn't really need that, as my
psychic senses detected the positive and potent aura of each
individually. There were impressions here that stirred the chords of
memory. However, these stones bore the memories of events long past
before the first Wizard of Green was born. I relished them and set
them aside at the same time. Very shortly, I would take up this
pleasant assimilation of the knowledge of the history of the South.
Now, however, I concentrated on the feeling of physical well being I
had from eating the waterberry and the exercise of walking up those
ancient stairs.

The stairway stopped at the main working area of the tower. All the
walls were lined with bookcases and pigeon holes, filled with
scrolls and codices of all sizes, and in many languages and
dialects. A large area of the floor immediately ahead of me
consisted of an inlaid map of the lands and isles of the Southern
people. On the other side of that map, in the middle of the floor
was my writing table. Upon it rested only a few objects.

One of these was a great green globe. This was one of the surviving
Eyes of Yattashdor. Each of the Wizards had one in her or his tower.
There was a very ancient story about how these survived the sinking
of the legendary land of Yattashdor. Many another myth, as well as a
lot of factual history told how they had passed through the hands of
many previous magic users, and even some people who did not
understand magic. The most significant and interesting of the
previous owners were the wizards of the Protectorate, who ages ago
had preserved peace and prosperity in the South for several
centuries.

One of the things which these globes did was to intensify telepathic
contact. They also amplified psychic energy in several other ways.
Indeed, by means of my Eye of Yattashdor I could send my mind
searching through the past for almost anything ever written since at
least the time of the Protectorate. Especially to a modern Earthman,
this made them seem a bit like a computer. However, these permitted
access to far more information, even than the Terran Internet,
though only in the hands, or rather the mind, of a major psychic.
There were stories of some amusing and some not so amusing
consequences of someone without the talent and training of a major
occultist getting a hold of one.

The chief item on my writing table was a book about six centimetres
thick, a third of a metre tall and a quarter of a metre wide. The
cover was made of the bark of the badarn tree, and the pages came
from the leaves of that tree. On the desk beside the book was a
small inkpot, which contained the sap of this same tree. The stylus
resting near the inkpot was from a reed that grows further south on
one of the islands beyond the Continent. This was my personal
journal. A few scant days ago many of its pages had been filled with
the spells, notes and observations of the previous Wizard of Green.
However, on his death these disappeared from the book. Now all its
pages were blank, though all the information it had contained was
preserved in my ring. Now, this was mine to write in as I willed.

I sat down in the ordinary chair behind the writing table. I removed
the lid of the inkpot, lifted the stylus and dipped it into that pot
as I lifted the lid of the journal with my left hand. This turned
easily, despite its weight. I knew that were anyone else to attempt
to open this book, such an effort would fail, however much force was
applied. For a moment, I paused staring at the blank first page.
Then at the top of that page I wrote, "This is the personal record
of the new Wizard of Green, the first to hold this position who was
born on the planet Earth." I felt a trace of awe as I realized that
these were the first words ever inscribed in one of these books
written in a Terran language.

Below that I wrote in the Southern language, "I, as all of my
predecessors before me, undertake to preserve and to protect the
South and its peoples, and all other peoples anywhere, who may
require my assistance."

When this was done, I let the stylus drop back into the inkpot. I
let the journal's great cover drop closed. I leaned back in my chair
and closed my eyes. I inhaled and I exhaled three times slowly,
completely absorbed in those breaths. Then I opened my eyes and
allowed them to rove across the relatively simple room. My mind
followed that gaze.

The most striking thing about this room was the depth of Southern
history that permeated it. Green was the Council member especially
charged with guardianship of the South. This he had done as
faithfully as so recently he had protected the Earth. Yet, in the
process he had become fascinated by the ancient history of the most
venerable and civilized of the peoples of this planet.

He had walked among them, gathering their ancient texts and
recording their folktales. He had imbibed the spirit of the Southern
lands and won the hearts of their people. Most of the treasures of
this tower were simple gifts bestowed by the Southerners upon this
revered guardian.

I let my mind begin to acclimatize itself to the Southern language,
as rapidly I absorbed, aided by my ring and the memories it
contained, the general history of the South. Then at a more
leisurely pace, though still very fast, and with far greater
retention of memory than the average university student would retain
from a year long course, I read the most ancient chronicles of the
earliest of the great empires that had flourished in the South. The
story which unfolded of those early navigational explorations, the
foundation of magical organizations and the lines of their research,
the literary and artistic accomplishments and all the other varied
endeavours of a quite vigorous civilization was utterly fascinating.

As I finished this, I let myself slide into a trance and my mind saw
with a vividness unobtainable even in the most modern Terran movie
theatre the scenes from this chronicle. When this was finished, I
felt myself almost as much adapted to and in love with the South as
any of my predecessors.

At last I stood up and ascended the flight of stairs from the second
to the third floor. The steps themselves were identical in
appearance to the great green stone steps leading from the ground
floor to the second one. Here also the walls were adorned with
special mementoes granted to the wizard from the lands and islands
of the great Southern race. One of these was an exquisitely crafted
statue of a sea mammal having no duplicate on Earth. On the wall,
about half way up was a map of the island of Zih-han. I realized
that there was a very special bond between the Wizard of Green and
this remote island, which had been the site of the Sisterhood of
Erissa during the dark days before the establishment and during the
rise of the Second Southern Empire.

I arrived at the top of the stairs. The ring had given me a
foreshadowing of what to expect. Still, what greated my eyes was
truly breathtaking. If the ground floor was the place where the
wizard cared for his body and the centre floor was where he devoted
his attention to his mental activities, this was where he came to
commune with his spirit.

I could feel here the forest that had given birth to him and his
people. The walls were painted, though that is too poor a word for
something more vivid and alive than the most realistic modern film
on Earth, with a vibrant reproduction of a forest scene. I could
hear the bubbling of a brook, just behind the bushes to my left. I
could hear the sound of the scampering of a few woodland creatures,
vaguely resembling rabbits and squirrels. I could hear the
twittering of many different species of birds, and from time to time
one would seem to sweep across the wall. I could smell the aroma of
this many scented spot. My sense of smell seemed thrice as effective
here, and the pleasure of the richness of that blend of scents
brought tears to my eyes.

The floor at my feet was also of stone, though it gave the illusion
of being a kind of straw, fresh and dry, which added to the
delightful mix of aromatic smells. I realized that this was meant to
represent the floor in the hut in the forest, which had been the
first home of my immediate predecessor.

The ceiling was crowned with a dome. Here was where the Wizard of
Green stood to gaze at the firmament. Actually, most of the time he
would lie on his back and let both his physical and metaphysical
sight take in the view. It came to me in a shock, one of the wisps
of memory tossed, as though from my unconscious, though really from
the ring, that it was the Wizard of Green lying here, one night,
barely four Earth years ago, sending his mind questing along the
astral path, who had first stumbled upon the triple hued gem
(silvery diamond for the clouds, sapphire blue for the seas and
emerald green for the vegetation) of Earth. He felt something very
special in an occult sense was connected with this world and thus,
even before the request came from the Galactic Federation, was
planted the seed of his expedition to Earth and his subsequent
death.

In one little enclosure there was a shrine. Here burned three small
candles and one larger one. The three were on behalf of his parents
and his brother, who had died long ago. The larger one was for all
his ancestors, those whose names were known and those not. He had
not used his magical abilities to add more ancient names to the
fading letters recorded over the generations on the badarn leaf
which was folded a bit like a small tent to form the enclosure.

I walked respectfully over to that shrine, continuing the ritual
start of the wizard's time on this floor. Then, I walked into the
centre of the floor, to my favourite spot here and lay down, as I
usually do, when I let my mind wander the mystic path.

One, who has not experienced what came next, could quite flippantly
say that I fell asleep and had a dream. However, I know that I did
not dream, not even a dream of a similar nature to the one I had
dreamed concerning what was truly happening in the cemetery.

It was my conscious mind, or something more than my conscious mind,
which rose from this tower and soared through a realm unknown to the
eyes of the body, even the eye of dream. There were colours there
which I had never seen. There were sounds as softly tinkling bells,
and the sweetest bird songs. There were odours more captivating than
the most precious rose, or even the sights and sounds and scents of
this physical planet.

There were faces of people long departed and recently deceased.
There, I beheld my friend, who had been the Wizard of Green. For a
time I rose and rose, through the cloudy strata, where the great
halls of learning of the astral planes tower in pink and tangerine
coral and emerald green. Then I stared amazed, for the golden light
gave way, as I ascended the tree, to one of dazzling white. In
horror and shock, I became aware of a presence, whom I strongly
suspected of being a god, if not the one god, worshipped by all of
the monotheists on all the worlds.

"This can't be," I thought, "I'm an atheist."

There came a sound as the rolling of thunder, and I realized it was
a laugh. The entity, whom I knew to be the centre of the worship of   
the people of this world, found my atheism amusing.

"I can read in your mind the kind of gentleman you deny occupies a
throne in heaven. I must confess that I agree with you and with the
Plutarch of your homeworld. I, too, prefer the people who say I
don't exist to those who say I'm a mean spirited guy, who'll give
you boils, if you don't pray to me. Still, just because some people
misuse a word, or don't understand, for example, just what is
gravity, doesn't mean there isn't something to which that word
applies, that there is no gravity." And then again came the
thunderous laughing, as though he had realized a joke. The thought
came to me that what he found funny was that I might question the
example he had chosen, as now I seemed to be floating ever upward,
disregarding the law of gravity.

Then as a bubble, my consciousness, or more than consciousness,
seemed to burst, and again it was my normal mind thinking normal
thoughts about that experience. This I continued to do until I
really did fall asleep, though I don't recall any dreams.
