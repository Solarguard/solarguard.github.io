The Letters of the Younger Pliny, transl. Betty Radice, Penguin,
Harmondsworth, 1967 (1963)

One of the enduring and very enjoyable influences on Western
civilization has been Roman examples of writing letters. Two
outstanding exemplars are Cicero and Pliny. This introduces the
more recent of these two men, Pliny the Younger, called so to
distinguish him from his uncle, the famous scholar.

The younger Pliny (c. 61-113 C.E.) who practised law and served in
various posts, including as governor of Bithynia, provides in his
letters fascinating glimpses of life in the Roman Empire. There are
his letters of recommendation, his letters with a number of friends
and others, many conveying very interesting information from his age
almost two thousand years ago.

Among his most interesting letters are the two he wrote to Tacitus
responding to that historians request for information on Vesuvius,
the volcanic eruption in 79 whose victims included Pliny the Elder.
As Tacitus' surviving work does not include his treatment of this
period, Pliny's eye witness account is significant. He tells us
that his uncle, both from scientific curiousity, and to aid in the
rescue work, sailed across the bay. There he died overcome by fumes.
Pliny the Younger declined his uncle's invitation to accompany him,
being too engrossed in a volume of Livy's history. The younger Pliny
describes quite graphically the terrors he himself and those around
him felt as they fled the volcano.

A number of official letters from Pliny's time as governor are
included. Among the most interesting of these is his request for
imperial advice on Bithynia's growing Christian population. He
displays previous misconceptions as to the nature of the faith,
states that his investigations revealed more harmless activity
than some portrayals and received imperial direction to disregard
annonymous accusations, as such were not in keeping with the spirit
of the age.

There are rewarding nuggets as one digs into Pliny's letters. For
example, his reference to the joy he has being away from Rome
during the popular and hectic chariot races. He much prefers
passing his time quietly in literary pursuits.

For a look at social life in the Roman Empire of his day, for a
glimpse of Roman imperial administration, for another example of
basic human similarities, this book is an excellent read.
