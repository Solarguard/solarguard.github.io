MENCIUS, transl. David Hinton, Counterpoint, Washinton, D.C., 1999

This appealing translation begins with an introduction placing the thinker
and his thought in the perspective of his time and environment. The work
itself is presented in its traditional form of seven pairs of chapters
named for an individual, or, for the last pair, thought, mentioned in the
beginning of the pair. 

Mencius comes across as one very concerned with humanity. From the end of
the first chapter, a sentiment expressed more than once in these pages:

   When every five-acre farm has mulberry trees around the farmhouse,
   people wear silk at fifty. And when the proper seasons of chickens and
   pigs and dogs are not neglected, people eat meat at seventy. When
   hundred-acre farms never violate their proper seasons, even large
   families don't go hungry. Pay close attention to the teaching in village 
   schools, and extend it to the child's family responsibilities -- then,
   when their silver hair glistens, people won't be out on roads and paths
   hauling heavy loads. Our black-haired people free of hunger and cold,
   wearing silk and eating meat in old age -- there have never been such
   times without a true emperor. p. 17  

As any brilliant philosopher, the author of this work conveys his wisdom
to the rulers and others he addresses with simplicity. He draws on history
for examples, and he points to present reality for what needs to be
bettered, chiefly by leaders being more concerned with the people they
rule. One of his concepts is that a true ruler will attract people into
his land and draw the respect of all.

   A heart of compassion is the seed of Humanity. A heart of conscience is
   the seed of Duty. A heart of courtesy is the seed of Ritual. And a
   heart of right and wrong is the seed of wisdom. p. 56

Here's a bit of wordplay in English:

   There's no end to what we should serve, but serving family is the basis
   of all service. And there's no end to what we should preserve, but
   preserving character is the basis of all preservation. p. 135  

He concludes his work with the following:

   Now its hardly been a hundred years from Confucius to our own age. We
   aren't far from his time, and we're so near his home. But if no one
   here's gleaned anything from that great sage, then no one here's
   gleaned anything. p. 274  

This thinker is highly recommended. This review may be lengthened in the
future. This initial version was written at dusk on the 38th day before
Imbolc, 2002 CE.<p>
