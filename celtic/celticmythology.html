<center>CELTIC MYTHOLOGY</center><p>

Proinsias MacCana, Hamlyn, 1973 (1970)<p>

This, at least the edition I have, is a coffee table book, a big book
with lots of white space and many large illustrations. The text, thus,
strikes the eye at first sight as almost of peripheral importance.<p>

The introduction starts with the thought, later repeated that the
ancient Celts were a cultural rather than a racial grouping. There is
the standard description of Celtic expansion and then of the impact of
Rome and later conquerors of Celtic lands, the oral nature of pagan
Celtic literature, the triad of earliest sources: inscriptions, staues
and comments in Greek and Latin.<p>

"By way of contrast, the recorded testimony of Irish literature is
later by a millennium or more, but, as we have seen, it has a
conservative quality which more than outweighs the disparity of date."
(pp. 16-17)<p>

The heroic Ulster cycle is contrasted with the lower class
fianaigheacht whose protaganists are more hunters than warriors.<p>

He mentions Marie-Louise Sjoestedt's, "'LEABHAR GABHALA is the
mythological pre-history of the country and the DINNSHENCHAS its
mythological geography.'" (p. 17)<p>

He mentions the tension between diversity and unity in Celtic
mythology and unity, responding to extreme views of unicity with,
"Indeed one cannot but reflect that if the Celts were monotheists at
heart, then they were remarkably successful in disguising this fact, for
not merely have they fractured their single godhead into a multiplicity
of aliases, but they have also invested some of these with a convincing
air of individuality." (p. 24)<p>

He compares and contrasts the gods of Gaul with those of the insular
Celts.<p>

<blockquote>Caesar's account has been impunged on two main grounds: first,
that it implies, erroneously, the existence of a pantheon of gods worshipped
more or less universally throughout Gaul, and, secondly, that it
enunciates a clear differentiation of divine function for which there is
no evidence in Celtic tradition. To note these twin objections is, in
effect to state the central problem of Celtic mythology. (P. 23)</blockquote>

He says that many accept the identity of the Gaulish Mercury with the
Irish Lugh (p. 27), that Lucan's Teutates means "God of the tribe", that
Maponus is likely Oengus Mac ind Og (p. 33), that Dian Cecht corresponds
to the healing function of Apollo (p. 33) and he mentions a comparision
of the Gaulish Minerva with Brigid, Gobhniu with Vulcan (p. 35) and
Oghma with Hercules. (p. 37)<p>

Donn, god of the dead, is equated with Caesar's Dis Pater, seen as
the divine ancestor of the Gauls. "This idea of common descent from a
divine ancestor is of course a familiar, one might almost say essential,
element of Celtic ideology. It was the normal thing for an Irish tribe
to trace its genealogy to an eponymous or other divine ancestor, and
some deities like Lugh are the reputed progenitors of many widely
scattered peoples." (p. 42)<p>

After mentioning horned gods such as Cernunos, MacCana proceeds to
the concept of triads. "Where they bear the same name, the members of
the triad are formally differentiated by epithet or attribute: where the
names differ, they share a functional identity." (p. 48) He discusses
then deities of topographical function and animate aspects of divinity.<p>

The second major section of the book is titled "The Tuatha De Danann"
and looks at the LEABHAR GABALA EIREANN and THE SECOND BATTLE OF MAG
TUIREDH. This latter refers to vital concepts such as kingly hospitality
and the effect of poetic satire. (p. 57) He mentions various
understandings of the mythological content in these sources such as the
conflict between a younger and older ruler, theomachy and Dumezil's view
of the tripartite function of Indo-European society. "Among the Celts
the stratification of Indian society is closely paralled by the early
irish classification of druids, warrior nobles (flatha) and freemen
(bo/-airigh), which in turn corresponds to Caesar's division of Gaulish
society into druides, equites and plebs." (p. 60)<p>

The otherworldly characteristics of the Tuatha De Danann who agreed
to live underground in the sidh mounds, their living, "'Without grief,
without sorrow...without age, without corruption of the earth," "The
relativity of time and space," connected with them, "Their control of
magic," are mentioned. (p. 65)<p>

And we glimpse: the Daghda with, "His club and cauldron," and
humourous aspect, Nuada and manannan mac Lir, "'The rider of the crested
sea.'" (p. 72)<p>

The third chapter considers "The Gods of Britain," as discussed in
the four branches of the Mabinogi: the account of Donn's family, equated
with Danann, the family of Pwyll and Pryderi. Among the interesting
points here is the identification of Don with Irish Danu (p. 76) and
Manawydan with Mananna/n in name but with some divergence of legend.
(pp. 79-80)<p>

The fourth chapter looks at the goddesses of the insular Celts,
including Medhbh, the Morrighan, Macha, "Who gave her name to Emhain
Macha, capital of the ancient province of Ulster" (p. 90) and goddesses
of sovereignty.<p>

The fifth section briefly surveys surviving Irish tales beginning
with the Tain and its remhsce/la and then moving into the cycle of Finn.
"The members of the Fian were hunters as well as fighters and this lends
their adventures a greater mobility and freedom than is found in the
Ulster tales." "They move throughout the length and breadth of Ireland
-- and into Gaelic Scotland -- in pursuit of their quarry, delighting in
the exhileration of the chase and in the endless variety of their
natural surroundings." (p. 108)<p>

There follow a few pages on Celtic sacral kingship, though, "It need
hardly be stressed that the sacral kingship and the sacred marriage of
king and goddess are not peculiarly Celtic, the former being more or
less universal and the latter well attested from India and the Near
East" (p. 121). The otherworld, life after death, with its references to
the Voyage of Bran, to Samhain, "A time apart which was charged with a
peculiar preternatural energy" (p. 127), and to the Welsh Annwn.<p>

The book concludes by considering the survival of the pagan tradition
in Christian garb, St. Brigid, "The Christian metropolis of Ard Macha
was sited within two miles of Emhain Macha, etc." (p. 131).<p>
