Chapter Twenty Three Sol

Again, the entity's physical form flickered, altered and changed.
Now it was a huge salamander reared above the Antarctic waste and.
roared.

"Behold my might and marvel!" came its telepathic bellowing.

It began to burn. A red and yellow glowing thing now hung there in
the frigid sky. Yet once more, it changed its shape. Now it was
endeavouring to convey the overwhelming impression that it was itself
a star, one just about to go nova. However, to me it looked more like
something from a flying saucer report. Funny, how I had argued so
strenuously against these with my friends, refusing all their
assertions and remaining steadfastly a non-believer in little green
men. And here I stood, ready to die with the aliens on behalf of
Earth.

This time it hurled not porcupine quills, but flares from its fiery
spherical form. It was this blazing heat, which it sent streaming
towards the ice shelf. We, the seven colours of the rainbow, dropped
our separate psychic shields. The electromagnetic fields that
surrounded each of our bodies, our individual auras, to use the
psychic term, we cast into the path of that stream of blazing
incandescent heat particles it was directing at the ice. We felt the
spherical salamander's ultradimensional energy as this was converted
into heat. We absorbed that heat, enough heat to melt a land of ice.
The atoms of our physical bodies we chilled and then chilled again.
Each time Kaylooree's hurled energy arrived with his intent of
raising our body heat rapidy beyond the boiling point, we dissipated
that heat not only into the darkness of interstellar space, but
drawing on the vast amounts of energy passing through us, we sent it
through time as well.

Our mind reached across space and time, feeling the building of the
heat we would dissipate there. We perceived the utter cold and the
basic blackness of space dimly dotted by the myriad points of light.
This was a region of space that for several light years in every
direction lacked its own star. With the tremendous energy at our
disposal, it was no trouble to reach out, to feel the locations of
each spare atom around, to pull, to attract those spare atoms, to
feel them coming from a distance of parsecs away, to sense them
responding to our call.

We felt those atoms joining, even as we were joined. We felt the
surging temperature of those atoms. We felt them piling together,
growing in mass. It gradually began to dawn on us, that through our
concentrated effort to transform and teleport that destructive
energy through space and time, something completely unexpected was
taking place. As the atoms formed into molecules, as the temperature
of those molecules rose higher and higher, to our amazement we
discovered that what Kaylooree had accomplished with all its plans
of destroying Antarctica, the earth and the sun, was to call into
being in the distant past a new star.

A strangely refreshing glow filled our being. Within our minds eyes
there appeared a benign figure, conveniently garbed in human form,
looking like any pleased woodsman from the forest of Gvihlih-hih, a
kind seeming fellow, smiling as though he had just heard a
particularly amusing joke.

Suddenly, a startling realization exploded into our minds, with all
the intensity of a nova. It did so in the form of a visual image of
star charts laid one upon the other, in the manner of pages turning
in an historical atlas. We knew with absolute certainty that this
star swirling before our awareness in the distant reaches of time
and space would move through both until it now lay but a hundred and
fifty million kilometres from the planet on whose behalf we had
decided to go the limit, even should it cost us our lives. With all
his grand designs of destroying the earth and causing the sun to go
nova, Kaylooree had simply provided the means for the birth of
Earth's sun.

The smiling woodsman projected his amusement from our seven minds to
the cooling little globe, hanging above the icy surface of
Antarctica. It had failed to burn through the earth's crust and
access the molten matter below. This meant it unexpectedly found
itself unable to proceed with the further stages of its design. Yet,
smiled the forest god at the demon master, it had by no means wasted
its energy. Rather, it had transformed that potential into such a
positive accomplishment as deserved the highest commendation and
recompense.

We could feel its rage ripen, as that awesome truth sank into its
awareness. From the cooling sphere emerged the bellowing and
howling of an angered dinosaur. Then its searing thought stabbed
into the mental nouosphere: "No. I shall not remain in so
inhospitable an environment. I shall return to the normality of my
realm and reign there undisturbed forever."

"Ah, but I meant what I declared," came the woodsman's voice within
my mind and I could tell that the others were aware of this, too.
"Time it is for the recompense for Kaylooree and all those who dwell
with its dimension. Go, now, my rainbow and deliver it."

"How can we go there bearing our mortal bodies?" thought Red.

"Then go without them," came his reply in a humourous tone.

"Agreed," came Indigo's serene response.

So, we left our seven bodies hovering in the air where they had been
intercepting Kaylooree's heated particles. Our seven spirits we sent
after the fleeing creature. As seven rays of light streaked our
souls on the trail of the lord of the abyss.

Then it happened. Our consciousness of distinction and separation
faded away before the dazzling light emanating from us. Instead, our
collective mind awoke. We were one. Rare, indeed, were such
occasions. Yet, they were and could be and this was one. We were
truly united. We were as fused and focused as anything one can
imagine. No atoms were combined in greater unity to form a single
molecule. No molecules were joined more perfectly to produce a cell.
No cells were more united in the organism of any plant or animal.
There was no greater harmony in the composition of any body great or
small.

Kaylooree sensed our transition from seven individuals into one
great blaze of light, and this frightened it, even more than all
that had confronted his experience within our dimension. His mind
reached out and touched the air in front of him. A black spot now
took shape there, a dark dot barely discernible in the vast expanse
of the awesome prospect all around. Kaylooree leaped for it, though
it seemed far too small to permit his passage. And as he went, he
hurled a parting thought at us.

"Stay back," he projected. "I leave you. Homeward bound am I to an
existential abode as beyond your comprehension as is yours beyond
the confines of my mind." With that it seemed he passed through a
portal and disappeared beyond the range of our senses.

We stirred, we the unit, we the one will of the Council of Light, we
the Rainbow of Colours. We did not hesitate to follow in pursuit of
the ruler of the ultradimensional existence. We went right up to the
spot where it seemed he had vanished. We didn't even pause there,
though there appeared to be nothing on the other side of so small a
doorway between the dimensions. We went through the portal after it.

There are no words in any of the languages of normal creatures to
describe the sensations and experiences that met us there. The most
inspired of poets and mystics have all confessed their powerlessness
to transmit to others any real description of their experiences in
the worlds beyond. They throw words together, or mingle musical
notes or dab different paint brushes on canvas. However moving the
result may be, it is inevitably an utter failure to do more than
intimate a hint of a suggestion of what they felt during samadhi or
whatever other psychic state they attained in their rising on the
planes beyond this mundane world.

We were hardly rising. Not ours the ecstatic thrill of the artist
and the mystic. What greeted us as we entered this great dominion of
the ruler of the Pit and the home of all his servitors seemed to be
nothing at all. There appeared to be no atmosphere. It was worse
than just being in outer space deprived of air and sound and heat.
There was not even the feeling that there was a background which was
black. That colour, or rather the lack of colour, was all around.
There was nothing else to see. In this place, which to all our
senses seemed to lack existence, we could not even feel, as if
before us lay the darkness of the void.

Certainly, we couldn't perceive any stars. No pinpoints of light
shone to brighten this everlasting night and give it the impression
of depth. It was as if we had come to a black wall, or perhaps a
black hole or a black point. It is true that we were now in a place
where deception was the norm. Yet, in the state in which we were,
our sixth sense, as it were, could not be fooled. In the eyes of the
dwellers of the realms of light, there was nothing here.

We could feel the entity we were pursuing venture deeper somehow.
This meant, at least to its way of thinking, there was space of some
kind here. We swiftly moved after it, even though this seemed a
contradiction of our clear perception that there was nothing here.
The thing we were chasing proceeded in an undeviating direction, or
rather in this dark point, its trail stood revealed as the only line
there was in this dimension.

Suddenly, the thought came to our collective mind, that this was an
inexact understanding. Instead, it was our own passage which was
giving depth to that unilateral lightless point. And not just depth
alone. Our wake shone with the light which we represented. Behind us
stretched a line of bright and brilliant hues, all the colours of
the rainbow of reality.

Our quarry seemed to have located a blotch, a blob, a patch of
darker black than the rest of the black wall. As our thought reached
for it, the darker shade coalesced and quivered. It turned to
ultraviolet and then to dark purple. The blot shifted shape even as
its changed shade. Now it was round.

We continued mentally to reach for it. Our rainbow hued essence
sought to encircle it, and in the process, the roundness acquired
the sensation of being a ball. This was the first time this plane
had conveyed the sensation of containing three different dimensions.
Now, before us lay a globe. It felt small and insignificant. Still,
we realized what it was and even as this realization registered on
our single consciousness, its dark colour began very gradually to
brighten.

"This is a planet," we thought, "or at least the beginning of one."
And as soon as we thought that out loud, as it were, it reacted. At
once, the dimness, almost the darkness, was scattered by a brilliant
blaze of light. We watched this planet become incandescent and
completely molten. There flickered from my experience into our
common awareness the joke concerning those fundamentalists, who hold
that the Bible is literally correct and the Earth, despite the
beliefs of scientists, only six thousand years old. One scientific
rebuttal was that such fundamentalists should be shown a planet only
six thousand years old. Here, was such a planet, or perhaps one a
lot younger than even six thousand years old.

Somehow the thing we chased had detected that thought and fired
another back at us, rather like a fleeing ancient warrior shooting
an arrow over his shoulder at those he was trying to escape. "This
isn't some normal planet as yet uncooled and lacking all you assume
a planet should contain. This is something your fundamentalist can
understand all too readily. This entire realm, dimension, reality is
nothing more and nothing less than Hell. You would do well to turn
back now, before it's too late and you find yourselves trapped here
forever. You may not find it then to your taste."

We shrugged that thought aside. The one cord composed of seven
strands, the one rainbow shining with seven rays, ignored as
insignificant the frank admission of this planet's ruler that we had
entered what Gvihlih-hihns call Kaylaar and Terrans name Hell.

We continued to follow the ruler of demons. Did it believe that it
could shake us off by going to a place too hot for us? How much it
lacked any real understanding of who we were and what was our
capacity, especially now that we were united. We felt the surface of
that molten planet begin to fill with bodiless entities. These flew
out to greet their sovereign. They were of many and varied shapes,
though none of them familiar to one from our plane.

Then, with a suddenness that seemed astounding even to us, they
shifted their multifarious forms and attired themselves with the
appearances of traditional devils. Some of them wore the shape of
the spidery ten legged thantay out of Gvihlih-hihn mythology. Others
had horns, tails and cleft feet and everything else one would expect
from a nightmare out of the Terran Middle Ages. It was a vast flock
of these that now greeted their master and hovered between us and
the burning globe.

"Master," projected one, "what has happened to the darkness?"

"Let us attack and rid our sphere of these intruders," projected
another.

For the briefest of moments it seemed that they were going to follow
that up, that the whole hive of them would swarm out and attack us.

"Sphere or husk?" we projected. We could sense that it was far from
pleased by that. Indeed, it was bothered by the potential it saw in
us.

"Don't fight them," it howled. "They have the magic of another
dimension backing them. We need time to become acquainted with this,
so we'll know how to overcome them."

"We bear no magic," we projected, "but the Light of all the worlds."

"Don't listen to them," it urged. "Follow me."

It began to speed away from the globe, moving deeper into the wall,
which now took on the image, in its mind and ours, of an abyss.

We felt very strange as we beheld a multitude of those utterly
demonic forms leaving the planet, which was still coaslescing and
taking shape before us. We noticed that some of them, however, were
choosing to stay. Were these going to attack us despite the direct
order of their chief? For a moment, it seemed that this might
happen. Then, those who had stayed behind dropped to the planet that
lay along our route. Our mind followed them and reached to grasp the
reality in which we now were.

We were aware that we were glowing as we had never glowed before. We
followed them, keeping our distance and sending out before us the
visualized image of a seven hued ray of light. Then, to our
amazement, this visualization took on a known form. It, too,
developed three dimensions and assumed a globular shape.

With more than a little awe, we realized that this image, this
reflection of us, had become the future source of light and heat for
the world below us.

"Not so," came the mental shout of a leading demon, one of the chief
deputies of the chief of chiefs. It moved towards us, all ablaze, a
salamander in the night that was far too bright for its pleasure.
Behind it came others adopting its choice of shape and form. "We
will still thwart you," it threatened. "Even deprived of our supreme
leader, we are more than enough for you. Have I not alone defeated
three of you?"

"So you were once a black fly," we projected, "and you did not go to
Mars?"

"I was too smart to fall for that."

"And with your selective memory, you are boasting of what you did
and now you're seeking to oppose the unfolding of destiny."

"Nonsense," it projected. "There is no destiny save my supremecy on
this blazing sphere. The planet you have brought into being will
simply be the greatest outpost of chaos within this chaotic and dark
abyss."

We did not argue with it. We let it think what it willed. We could
sense the attention of all the demons present. This was the highest
ranking one left among them here, where they had festered since they
had entered this formerly shadowy realm. We simply hung there
shining our light on the planet and its new sun.

Then, before our presence, the planet changed and changed again. The
sky turned turqoise. The ground cooled and hardened. Turquoise
oceans formed over a portion of that cooling globe. There appeared
on the surface of the waters tiny, even microscopic, beings, very
simple ones containing but a single cell. These rapidly grew more
complex and some of them crawled out of the water onto the
surrounding shores. Soon we were viewing verdant vegetation sweeping
around the globe. Those plants we perceived were as aromatic as any
on Earth or Gvihlih-hih.

The chief salamander and a number of its fellows began to scream in
rage. Most of the underlings, however, simply stared in wonder,
dazzled by the splendour and the miracle of life. As we and they
continued to watch, the organisms continued to grow more and more
complex.

A few of the salamanders, but a handful, screamed again their
unwillingness to accept this altered state of their existence. These
flung themselves hastening after the many who were still following
Kaylooree. However, within the spirits of all the rest at this
planet there dawned the realization that reality was far other than
what they had thought possible. They had imagined that their
existence was set and eternal in one pattern, that they had no hope
of any change for the better. How many of them had come from worlds
and faiths that had taught the erroneous concept of the permanency
of hell and the eternal deprivation of the damned.

Yet, here we were sending the single luminous thought that such a
belief was incorrect. Here we were demonstrating that even in hell
grass could grow, the fires cease and the breezes of hope arise and
cool the sorrowed souls.

All of this, we noted in the briefest of instants, as we continued
on after Kaylooree and all those who had chosen to flee with him.
We sent in front of us the image of the transformation that was now
taking place on the world we had passed. This was not without
effect. While about half of them, so long used to deception, refused
to believe the reality of what they read from our minds, another
half could not doubt the veracity of our thoughts. These halted and
began to proceed in the direction of their world that now lay behind
us. They were thinking of checking out for themselves what they knew
to be an accurate transmission.

As waves come to the shore, as day follows night, as the seasons
change and return again, so did this pattern repeat itself. Again
and again, Kaylooree and the demons at his heels attained another
blob or blotch or patch of darkness darker than the surrounding
blackness, which now in the direction from which we came contained
sparkling points of light. The result was that as soon as the seven
hued light of our essence reached to embrace that new blotch, it
too went rapidly through the same stages as the first one and yet
another planet was born. Soon there were many planets warmed and lit
by their own hearth fires, newborn suns, newly created stars in this
expanding dimension. Unlike the larger universe from which we had
come, all of the planets here were from their beginning inhabited by
these demons, if such they were.

At last it seemed Kaylooree grew tired of this. He arrived at yet
one more dark blob, whose inhabitants arose to greet him.

"Enough," we sensed him project to them. "No further shall I go.
Here, shall I, we, face the invaders and drive them back."

"No further is there to go," came a thought, or even a thousand
similar thoughts from the entities around him. It seemed that he had
arrived at the limit of his kingdom, the hull as it were of the
narrow place he ruled. He did not dispute that assertion, though we
felt his sense of humiliation at knowing that we had perceived this
testimony to the constraints of the area he dominated.

"Never mind that," he projected. "I, we, descend to the surface of
this globe." And, complying with that command, he, along with
thousands of his followers, dropped to the surface.
