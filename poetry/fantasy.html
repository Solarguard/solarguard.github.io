FANTASY

Fantasy is the myth maker's country.
He carries you there on his ship of tales,
Of the marvellous places one might see,
Elfish realms where wizardry never fails.
Ah, 'tis so real this unreality.

LOVE

True love is as elusive as the mist.
A million men might wonder what it was,
But 'tis a thing that must be felt foremost,
In o're a thousand fascinating ways.
Upon the eternal sea, it's the mast.

Michael McKenny May 20, 1974

At the suggestion of Bahram Katirai, four of us: Al Wloch, Albert
Ouimet, Bahram Katirai and I wrote a five verse poem on fantasy. Next
Albert suggested the title "Love". This is the first time I have
written to a title.

One night weary walking along a road,
Sipping silence and dreaming of sleep soon,
I groaned as came a din to shake the moon.
A flame painted speedster screached and streaked past,
Proudly racing nowhere noisily, fast.
Without a thought my hand extended straight.
"Oh no, I can't," I thought, alas, too late.
Upon a rolling pumpkin sat a toad.

Michael McKenny August 29, 1978
