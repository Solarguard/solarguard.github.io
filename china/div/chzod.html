THE NEW CHINESE ASTROLOGY, Suzanne White, St. Martin's Press, New York,
1993

This is a charming book, almost six hundred pages long. She writes in so
captivating a style, with adept use of English idiom connected to the
animals of the twelve signs that there is a very strong resonance. She
mentions friends and famous people in each sign and talks about them in
so very nice a way that whatever sign one has, one feels accepted,
pleasing and happy, even though she also tells her readers the negative
side of each of the signs.

These signs, using her chapter headings, are:

This writer is a romantic and that comes through very well in this book.
Her major flaw for readers with a feel for Chinese astrology (this is,
after all, in the title of her book) is that she has transformed the
rabbit into a cat. She says that she learned about the zodiac from
Vietnamese sources, that scholars told her there were no rabbits in
Vietnam when Chinese astrology arrived there, so they used the cat
instead. She does invite anyone very upset with this simply to cross out
her word cat every time it appears in the book and write in rabbit. In
my opinion, her use of language connected with the animal described does
not allow this to work perfectly.

Her format is to begin each chapter of the twelve signs with a letter a
page and a half or so long, charmingly written and signed individually
to each of them (e.g. "in all humility," to the dragon and "Buoyantly
yours," to the rooster), provide a page summary of bests, favourites,
mottos, good and bad qualities, a chatty general description, the five
elements as they apply to the animal, the sign's health and future. She
has almost fifty pages on marital compatibility and a chart listing the
Chinese years from 1516.

Some readers may be discouraged by the fact that the book only goes
ahead to the end of the current cycle. In 1993, 2008 undoubtedly seemed
far away. She may have done better for continuing readership to have
added future dates for further cycles. However, this book is written in
so captivating a style, with such delicious use of English language that
anyone, except, perhaps, some rabbits, may enjoy this nice introduction
to Chinese astrology. It is recommended to all interested in the topic.
