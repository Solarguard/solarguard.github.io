The Ancient Explorers, M. Cary and E.H. Warmington, Penguin,
Harmondsworth, 1963 (1929)

Preface (9-10): The focus here is on ancient travellers, not early
geographical theories.

1. Introductory (11-20): All ages sought material advantages; ancients
had scant motivation from missionary or scientific aims. Sparsity of
arable land at home drove Greeks and Phoenicians abroad. Land travel
was on foot or by animal; sea travel on ancient ships averaged fifty
five nautical miles a day. Sun, stars and wind, in the absence of the
compass, directed travellers.

2. The Mediterranean and the Black Sea (21-42): Mediterranean storms
restricted safe travel to from May to September. From at least the
Third Millennium B.C. Minoans traded in the Aegian and with Egypt.
Possibly later they traded with Sicily and even further places.
Phoenicians are well attested in written sources, less so in
archaeological finds, as early exploring much of the Mediterranean. By
c. 800 B.C. Greeks began colonial expansion. By c. 650 they were
settled at Naucratis in Egypt, in Cyrene, in Sicily and southern Italy
and had evaded Phoenicians to reach Tartessos. Massilia (Marseilles)
was founded c. 600 B.C. Phoenician Carthage controlled much of the
western Mediterranean. Etruria in Italy lost a battle to Greeks in 474
B.C.

Jason may have entered the Black Sea c. 1250 B.C. Ship passage is
difficult and sailing conditions often unfavourable. By c. 800, Greeks,
especially from Miletus, came seeking fish and metals.

3. The Atlantic (43-72): From at least the Second Millennium Atlantic
peoples sailed in seaworthy craft. Irish gold, British tin and
Scandinavian amber reached Brittany and Tartessians. Phoenician Gades,
founded c. 1100 B.C., by 500 replaced Tartessos. Himilco sailed maybe
as far as Britain c. 300 B.C. Pythias of Massilia evaded Phoenicians,
sailed to and possibly around, Britain and then east along the European
coast to the Elbe and across to Amber Island (Heligoland). He is
considered the source of Greek knowledge about Britain and Thule
(Norway?).

Carthage's fall opened the Atlantic to Roman, likely South Italian
Greek, ventures. In the First Century A.D. Romans opened Spanish tin
mines, replacing British tin. Caesar and later invaders gained first
hand knowledge of Britain. Agricola's ships sailed all along the east
coast and possibly circumnavigated the island. He may have sent scouts
to Ireland; its coast as far as the Shannon was known before this. In 5
A.D. Romans sailed beyond the Elbe to Jutland's Cape Skagen.

Phoenicians sailed along West Africa. Hanno in c. 500 B.C. established
Carthaginian colonies in Atlantic Morocco and explored as far as Sierra
Leone. Later Polybius may have reached the Senegal on Roman ships,
though the Romans do not appear to have followed this up. Morocco's
King Juba (c. 25 B.C. to 25 A.D.) wrote a book on African geography and
sent an expedition to the Canary Islands. Ancients may have visited the
Madeiras and, less likely, the Azores.

4. Indian Waters (73-109): Egyptians reached the Somali coast, Arabia
and Socotra. Mesopotamians probed along the Arabian coast. Phoenicians
and Arabs controlled Persian Gulf trade. c. 510 B.C Darius sent Scylax
down the Indus, along the coast, across the Persian Gulf and along the
Arabian coast to Arsinoe near Suez. Darius reopened a canal linking the
Nile and the Red Sea. Alexander sent Nearchus from the Indus to the
Euphrates. He had other officers explore the Persian Gulf and Arabia's
western coast. Ptolemaic Egypt explored East Africa, suppressed Red Sea
piracy and possibly (Eudoxus after 146 B.C.) reached India. Seleucids
also reached India, but Arabs and Persians were significant obstacles
to direct Greek-Indian trade.

Rome's awesome rise created demands for eastern luxuries. In 25 B.C.
Aulus Gellius advanced on Mar'ib. In 1 B.C. Aden was raided. Shortly
after Augustus, Hippalus discovered the monsoon. c. 50 A.D. better
Indian arrival points were found. A late First Century guide book
describes Greeks visiting Axum and Africa's east coast possibly to
Zanzibar and the west coast of India. Noted are dangers natural and
piratical. It mentions as well the temple to Augustus Roman settlers
built at Cranganore in the south. Romans sailed along India's east
coast to the Ganges, crossed to Southeast Asia and even are recorded
(e.g. 166, 226 and 284) as meeting with the Chinese.

5 The Circumnavigation of Africa (110-131): Africa's enormous coast,
vast Saharan wastes, heat and disease, including malaria, were barriers
to exploration. Herodotus recounts Phoenicians c. 600 B.C. sailing
around Africa for Pharaoh Neccho. The Persian Sostaspes and the Greek
Eudoxus made unsuccessful attempts to circumnavigate the continent.

6. Europe (132-156): Land trade and military activity at various
regions (Spain, Scythia, Danube, Balkans, Adriatic to Baltic, Alps,
France and western Germany) are considered on the basis of Classical
references and of archaeological finds, especially coins. Among the
interesting points are: Pliny's reference to the Roman who travelled c.
1 B.C. from near Vienna to the Baltic and returned with a large
quantity of amber, Strabo's mention of the land transport of British
tin across Gaul and Tacitus' note that trade across the Rhine and
Upper Danube could occur only at specified stations.

7. Asia (157-201): Homer mentions not Mesopotamia nor Arabia; Herodotus
has more to say. The vast Persian Empire included Greeks within it;
Xerxes' army brought many different Asian peoples to Greece. Greeks
knew the Caspian and lands beyond, then forgot its inland nature until
possibly as late as the Second Century A.D. Xenophon's account of the
mercenaries' return described a route from near Babylon to the Black
Sea; Alexander travelled through a more extensive territory. The cities
he founded and his successors' kingdoms made well known large areas to
Greeks. Seleucus' explorers and ambassadors travelled to and received
reports of Central Asia and India. Ashoka (264 B.C. to 227 B.C.) sent
ambassadors and Buddhist missionaries to the Greek kingdoms. Later the
Seleucids faced pressure from west and east. Greek Bactria persisted
for a time beyond Parthia.

Rome confronted Mithridates in Asia Minor and reached the Caucuses.
Crassus' invasion of Parthia halted at Carrhae; some captives reached
Merv. Anthony entered Azerbayjan; Augustus accepted overlordship of
Armenia and the Euphrates as his border. Caravan routes from Hadramut
to the Euphrates and southern Arabia to Aqaba were known, not Arabia's
inner towns. In 25 B.C Gallus led a Roman force on a long, difficult
journey through Arabia without military gain. Merchants and ambassadors
travelled through Petra or Palmyra. Trajan made a Nabataean province
and built new roads along Arabia's borders and to the Persian Gulf.

For Augustus, Isidore of Charax surveyed as far as Merv and Kandahar.
"Agrippa compiled a survey and wall-map of all the Empire and its
neighbouring regions." (p. 195) In 97 A.D. Kan Ying arrived in Antioch.
c. 120 the Roman merchant Maes sent agents to meet Chinese travellers
along the Silk Road. Romans gained more awareness of this all the way
to Lo-Yang, as well as of the Huang Ho and Yangtze. They knew of the
silkworm.

8 Africa (202-221): Egypt from the Old Kingdom exerted pressure and
influence south and received goods, including incense, ivory and ebony.
Greek mercenaries were in the army Psammetichus II (594-589) sent to
Abu Simbel. Persia's Cambyses led a force beyond Egypt in vain.
Herodotus visited Egypt as far as Elephantine. Ptolemaic Egypt explored
far along the coast; inland it had close contact with Meroe.

In 25 B.C. Petronius led a Roman force to Napata. In 21 B.C. Rome
agreed that the border be at Maharrakah. Nero sent Praetorian guardsmen
to explore south of Egypt:

   But it is clear that the men had reached far beyond Meroe, even as
   far as the great marshes formed partly by sudd on the White Nile
   above the point where the Sobat comes in. They reached regions not
   visited again by Europeans for more than seventeen centuries --
   regions discovered again in 1839 and 1840. p. 215

The Blue Nile was also explored. Ptolemy mentions a Diogenes blown to
perhaps Dar-es-Salam and travelling to, or being informed of, the land
inland. Herodotus records a perhaps one time trip from Cyrene to
possibly Lake Chad and the Niger. Carthaginians are reported to have
traded across the Sahara. Roman military operations included: Cornelius
Balbus' taking of Jerma, capital of Garamantia, in 19 B.C.; Septimius
Flavius' advance c. 75 B.C.; Julius Meternus' joining with Garamantes
in a four month thrust from Jerma and Suetonius Paulinus' (Boudicca's
conqueror) pursuit across the Atlas and ten days beyond.

9. Results of Ancient Explorations (222-232): Classical geographical
texts are mentioned, their omissions and inaccuracies stated and their
influence on Medieval and later readers briefly outlined.

10. Imaginary Discoveries (233-245): From ancient Egyptians and
Sumerians tellers of tales have served up sea voyages and land
journeys. National pride produced some incredible yarns. Real heroes
accumulated extra larger than life deeds. Remote peoples (north, east,
Indian, Socotran, African, Atlantean, etc.) became weird or utopian.
The crowning such work is Lucian's satirical "True Story" presenting a
fabulous journeying inside an enormous whale and to the court of the
King of the Moon, etc.

This is a fascinating book on a very interesting topic. It is a bit
dated, though that impacts less the Classical references. The authors
knew well this subject which has not altered much in the interval. A
reader is advised to be a bit cautious as to interpretations based on
archaeological finds, especially the presence, or absence, of Greek or
Roman coins.
