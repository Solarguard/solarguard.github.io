Introduction                                                                                             IX                                                               
Preface                                                                                                  XI

(ix-x) Intro by William L. Langer: This series hopes to provide a survey of a vast field, covering more than military and political events, considering all from a European view. Each volume can stand alone. This one by a dean of American historians sets the stage. 
(xi) Preface by Edward P. Cheyney: This look at a long period with many interesting events and personalities took a long time to write. Many helped this inadequate author.
Ii (1-2) Introduction: The Middle Ages ended and modern times dawned with a nascent capitalism.
ii (2-4) The Spread of Commerce: Wealth increased and trade both in goods and ideas.
iii (4-10): The Materials of Commerce: These included: salt, lumber (the word spruce comes from Prussia), hides, wool, grain and manufactured products: textiles, iron weapons and bronze bells. Also, dyes, spices, perfumes, silk and gems came from the distant East.
iv (10-19): The Flanders fleet of Venice: Venice was well located to trade with the East and with the rest of Italy and Western and Central Europe. In the 1290s, Venice introduced great galleys, with more oars and then sails, arranged them in fleets, extendung Venice's direct reach, including to England and the Netherlands. Protected by archers, it sailed in early spring with sugar, spices, silk, glass, paper, books, etc. to trade for wool, tin, lead, leather, etc. in England, and brass, bowstrings, serge, etc. in Bruges. Venetian merchants resident in Bruges and London, closely supervised by the Venetian Senate, assembled the cargoes for the return voyage. Disputes between visiting merchants and locals did arise with royal authority keen to support the Venetians.
v. (19-26) The Hanseatic League: German towns especially confederated, eighty or more northern towns becoming the Hanseatic League.This grew naturally and traded as far as England and Iceland, offering northern products for salt, wool, tin and Mediterranean products.The League's influence grew. In the late 1360s, it took military action against an aggressive Danish king, defeating him. In 1375 Emperor Charles IV recognized the League. The League had a flag, diplomats and its towns met, delegats attending diets, usually at Lubeck. There was Hansa coinage, weights and measures. League merchants were organized in settlements from France to Russia, those in Novgorod, London, Bruges and Bergen especially significant.
vi. (26-28) The Steelyard in London: Existing from at least 1250, for more than three hundred years, the Hansa colony in London had an enclosure with warehouses, offices, houses, a council hall. etc. The two to three hundred residents had a 9 pm curfew and other regulations.
vii. (28-31) Other Trading Settlements: Rulers, nobles, the clergy welcomed merchants and recognized their rights. Merchants provided fine clothes and other luxuries, helped fill royal, etc., coffers, and could loan money. Many European lands accorded privileges to foreign merchants in the late 13th Century. Merchants, for protection, etc., formed their own settlements in foreign lands.
viii. (31-34) The Spread of Maritime and Commercial Law: A common maritime law, perhaps drawn from traditional Roman sea law, facilitated increased commerce. There were different codes (e.g. Oleron, Lubeck or Hansa, Consulate), but little disagreement on principles. Commercial law could feel significant local custom, though here, too, common issues produced a uniformity enabling commerce.
ix. (34-36) The Increase of Wealth: Despite wars and natural calamities, the Black Death included, Europe in 1450 was richer than in 1250, trade greater.

II i. (37-41): Merchant Money-Lenders: European capitalism emerged earlier than many realize. Some Italian and Flemish manufacturing required considerable capital. A clear line between traders and bankers did not yet exist. Prominent merchants included Tiedemann of Limburg, Nicholas Bartholemew of Lucca. London mayors John 
Pultney, John Philpot and Richard Whittington, loaned substantial sums to kings, who repaid. Also wealthy were French  merchants Reginald d'Auriac, Pierre Gilles and Etienne Marcel and Germany's Liutfried Muntprat.
ii. (41-44) The Bankers: Modern banking emerged from: profits in trade, money lending, money transfer and security and royal, papal, etc. need for ready cash. Florence was a major banking city. Money changers were at every fair. The pope claimed Peter's pence and required additional cash from Siennese, etc. bankers. Orlando and Bonifazio c. 1250 established a money lending business in Sienna. They did much papal business and also served King Philip the Fair. When Buoni Signori agents fled with the French money, that king seized property from other Siennese in France. There were other bankers in Italy and beyond. Rome attracted banks, especially as family businesses.
iii. (44-51) Florence as a Banking City: Florence was Italy's prime money market, its leading bankers widely renouned. They helped collect papal funds throughout Europe. They imported English wool. Bankers helped rulers pay for wars. Economic downturns could severely impact banking families. Despite Biblical opposition to usury, lenders sought back more than they loaned. Kings might not repay, or might seize needed funds. In time, rulers relied less on foreign lenders.
iv. (51-55) Jacques Coeur: Jacques Coeur is a prime example of the great national lender and of one Fortune raised high and dropped. His Bourges residence remains a key example of the age's architecture. He travelled as far as Damascus, owned ships and warehouses, secured long lasting French advantages in the Ottoman Empire and headed France's royal household's treasury and the Bourges and Paris mints. He was ennobled, obtained prominent positions for relatives, loaned substantially to French royalty, etc. Accused of poisoning the king's mistress, he was imprisoned, tortured, despoiled and banished. He died on Chios in 1456.
v. (55-56) The Origin of Modern Banking: Some of the period's lesser bankers (e.g. Medici and Fugger) survived more prominent failures to lead in future. Government chartered banks, not yet significant, began to emerge.
vi. (56-63) The Influence of Coined Money: Transactions usually used coins. Rulers encouraged prospectors and miners. England also imported large amounts (bars and coins) of silver. Thirteenth Century gold coins were Western Europr's first since Charlemagne's. Highly regarded were Florence's florin and Venice's ducat, the latter especially circulating in the East. Transactions were largely in silver coins, used in both city and country.

III i. (64-70) The Towns: The Middle Class rose in towns, increasingly important. Spain's centuries long struggle with the Moors added and strengthened walled towns. Aragon's king granted Barcelona charters in 1247 and 1258. That city's banking, commerce and sea law were influential in the Thirteenth Century Mediterranean. France had some four hundred cities and towns with significant self rule. Older towns generally were controlled by leading families, land owners, merchants, artisans, etc. Newer towns tended to be more democratic. England's 150 towns had less authority than French and Spanish towns. German cities were more independent. Towns in East and Southeast Europe were sparser and farther apart, though still significant in that vast area's history.
ii. (70-73) Confederations of Cities: In addition to the Hanseatic League, towns in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, etc. confederated.
iii. (73-79): The Cortes of Castille and Leon: Spanish towns sent representatives to meetings as early as the Twelfth Century. Castile and Leon had a common Cortes from the Thirteenth Century. Kings called meetings seeking financing. As nobles and clerics were tax exempt, tax paying townsmen were important, often gaining concessions (e.g. inclusion on royal council) for funds. The cortes set laborer's wage rates, regulated clergy rights, pressed for discrimination against the Jews, etc. Number of towns represented varied, as did each town's number of representatives until 1429-1430, when it was set at two each. Impressive ceremony occurred at the cortes.
iv. (79-83) The Cortes of Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia: These also date from the Twelfth Century. Aragon's nobility formed two estates, greater nobles and knights. With clergy and townsmen these formed four estates. Aragon got around its need for unanimous decisions. Catalonia's cortes was similar to Aragon's, though it had three, not four, estates. It enabled royal military ventures on Sicily, Sardinia and the Belearic Islands. At times, Valencia, Catalonia and Aragon, having the same king, met together. Navarre was closer to France. Portugal had its own history. Towards the end of this volume's period, as royal authority augmented, Spanish cortes declined. 
v. (83-88) The Estates General of France: French middle class representatives first attended an assembly, lomg restricted to nobles and clerics, during the 1298-1308 dispute between Pope Boniface VIII and King Philip the Fair. French kings had consulted the towns previously on financial matters. The Estates General met on April 10, 1302 and supported the king in his dispute with the pope. At least 226 towns were represented in the 1308 Estates General.Such assemblies approved a sales tax, agreed to exclude women from the throne, and rejected Edward III's claim to be rightful French king. In the early Fourteenth Century, townsmen were also summoned to gatherings on their own. Various assemblings resulted in considerable travel.
vi. (88-96) The Supremecy of the Third Estate in France: French defeats in the Hundred Years War lessened royal authority, enabling the Third Estate to exercise considerable financial control. The heir, with his father an English prisoner, first resisted, then conceded Estates proposed reforms, the "Great Ordinances." This constructive, somewhat democratic document focused on good administration. Attendance at Estates sessions diminished, governance proved difficult, contention increased. The dauphin fled from Paris to his supporters. The Estates leader and six of his companions were killed. The dauphin was invited back. He returned and in 1359 held a loyal Estates General. Mid Fifteenth Century Estates General, establishing a standing army and regular taxation, allowed a lengthy period without kings summoning an Estates General. 
vii. (96-106) The English House of Commons: English middle classes, as those of other lands, began to share in government in this period. In 1265 towns were asked to send two representatives each to parliament. Shires sent knights (owners of 600 acres). Townsmen were taxed at a higher rate than land owners. They met together at the Commons as early as 1332. The Commons's authority increased throughout the Thirteenth Century. It met frequently, advising the king on many matters, including foreign affairs and the dismessal of royal ministers. In 1399 at Westminster, before Lords and Commons, Richard II abdicated and Henry IV was acclaimed King. In 1422, Parliament appointed the regency council for the infant king.
viii. (106=109) The German Reichstag: German middle classes first participated in assemblies during the Interregnum (1254-1273). German cities were strong. They often preferred to maintain peace internally, than to expect it more widely from diets, often attended by warriors and warriors' patrons. With the Empire restored under Rudolph Hapsburg, townsmen attended imperially called diets. The third Estate was more influential in local and regional assemblies, etc., than in the Reichstag. Bohemis and Sweden had townsmen participating in assemblies after, or in, 1435, respectively.
    
IV (110-111) Uprisings occurred throughout this period, thrusting up obscure leaders, who often fell back into the unknown. Causes and consequences are generally unclear.
i. (111-115) The Insurrection of the Shepherds: Louis IX's 1250 appeal for Crusaders stirred rural, Northern France. A leader emerged, a "Master." The movement spread. Thousands joined. The Master and others performed priestly function. They wandered. In Paris, Blanche of Castile, Queen Mother, welcomed them. Violence broke out. Jews and legitimate clergy were attacked. Blanche ordered them suppressed. They were. The Master was killed. One branch reached England, gained supporters, was opposed and irdered out of the country. Some joined King Louis in Syria.
ii. (115-117) The Sicilian Ves[ers: There was a sudden rising on Sicily, on March 31, 1282, against the French.
iii (117-123) The Netherlands Risings: The Netherlands, densely populated and divided between wealthy capitalists and workers (Ghent c. 1300 had 2,300 weavers), faced frequent risings. On May 18, 1302, the lower classes in Bruges struck at French troops, seen as supporting the wealthy. Many died sleeping. Rebels also killed aristocrats. The revolt spread. An avenging French force was defeated two months later in the Battle of the Spurs. Flemish nationalism stirred. Royalist and aristocratic control was gradually reasserted. Successive risings occurred. 1323-1328 was a tense period. Peasants, laborers, e.g. weavers, struck at the upper classes. Priests were targets. A strong royal army defeated the rebels at Cassel in August 1328. The king moderated severe reprisals, Jacques and Philip van Artevelt's rebellions were nationalist and political and will be treated later.
iv. (123-126) The Jacquerie and the Rising Under Marcel: In 1358, French peasants, battered by war and plague, taxation and forced labor, suddenly rose, slaying knights and their families. The rebellion was vigorously put down with significant loss of life. Stephen Marcel led a rebellion in Paris. He was killed.
v. (126-131) Italian Risings: Cola di Rienzi led an uprising in Rome on May 25, 1347. His arrogance and luxurious style cost him popular support. He fled disguised. Baroncelli tried to continue popular rule. The pope preferred Rienzi, who returned only to fall again from popular favor. He was executed on October 8, 1354. Florence experienced a number of risings, including  the 1378 workers revolt. Michele Lando ruled for two months, then peacefully retired. Throughout Europe 1378-1383 was a period of revolution. Rouen felt one on February 24, 1382. It was suppressed and its leaders beheaded. Flanders in 1381 witnessed renewed rebellion under the son of an earlier leader. Philip Artevelde was killed in battle. After defeating him, young King Charles VI suppressed a Parisian uprising. Another there in 1413 was finally quashed with many killed.
vi. (131-141)  The Peasanys' Insurrection in England: England's peasants, dissatisfied for years, rose in 1381. They had a number of leaders, the best known Wat Taylor. Groups of rioters (peasants, laborers, artisans) proceeded to London. They attacked foreigners, raided wine cellars, beat and killed masters, etc. Some royal officials, including the Chancellor (Archbishop Sudbury) and Treasurer (Robert Hales) were beheaded. Taylor was killed. the young king quieted the London mob, which dispersed. Across the country, monasteries and towns were seized, judges killed, records burned and clerks beheaded. The rising was fiercely suppressed. It was over by the end of 1381. Mention of demands (ending compulsory labor, reducing taxes, etc.) is a rare look at England's  peasanys' feelings in their own words. Numerous popular risings across Europe at this time convey the age's disorder, feudalism's decline, capitalism's changes, the peasants' lack of opportunity to express their concerns, etc.
                              
V. Among so many wars in an age of almost constant fighting, the most famous war is the Hundred Years War. (1338-1452).
i. (142-148) The Causes of the War: Poetic blame of Robert of Artois aside, Edward III's ambitions, his feudal relationship to the French king, maritime disputes, economic issues, French centralizing, the Salic law excluding women, border fighting, etc. largely account for the lengthy war.
ii. (148-153) The Early Alliances of the War: Edward forged a web of alliances and sought to fund the war through a manipulated high cost for English wool, and heavy borrowing. France's King Philip awaited the invasion, making little preparation. 
iii. (153-158) The Ravaging of France: During their first invasion, the English plundered what they could, destroying the rest (more than a thousand villages, even Limoges Cathedral). French sailors returned the favor to England's south. England burnt and devastated in subsequent campaigns. At first, walls saved towns. "But undefended churches and monasteries, villages and the countryside were never spared. The piety of the time was no more adequate than its chivalry." (pp. 154-155) The 1360 truce merely substituted bandits for soldiers. Lashing French ships together, to block the 1340 English invading fleet failed, when England tricked the French into separating their ships, then facing the fury of the longbow, England remained able to cross the Channel to launch successive invasions. France won some sea battles. 
iv. (158-162) The Early Course of the War: This included the 1346 Battle of Crecy, where the outnumbered English using the longbow completely defeated a much larger French force. England seized Calais in 1347, transformed it into an English port and held it for two centuries. In 1356 England defeated France at Poitiers, capturing King John II and some high nobles. A 1360 truce transferred land to England, imposed a large indemnity and called for the king to remain in English hands until payment.
v. (162-166) Later stages of the War: Henry V invaded in 1415, took Normandy, won the Battle of Agincourt, though badly outnumbered and dictated the 1420 Treaty of Troyes, rejected by the dauphin. Plunder no longer met English needs. Technology advanced. Cannons and gunpowder reduced the effectiveness of walled resistance. Sieges were numberous. Some resisting were hung. Commanders gained experience. Brigandage grew routine. Population declined.
vi. (166-167): The Advance of Nationalism. Nationalism grew, attracting to the French cause dukes (Brittany, Normandy, Aquitaine and Burgandy) previously supporting England. 
vii. (167-171) Joan of Arc: Joan exemplified lower class patriotism. She stirred the defeatist dauphin Charles and his pessimistic supporters to relieve beseiged Orleans. She dictated demands to the English that obeying God they depart. She entered Orleans, aroused its defenders and  drove off the beseigers. She led the dauphin to his crowning as Charles VII at Rheims. Continuing her efforts, she was captured, tried at length, confessed to pretending to hear voices, was convicted and on May 30, 1431 burned. She demonstrated and inspired patriotism.
viii. (171-173) The Close of the War: Negotiations failed as neither king would yield claim to disputed lands. England in general lost taste for this war, developing other priorities. French forces pushed the English out, the last serious action occurring in 1453 as the French took Castillon and Bordeaux. This war stopped without treaty, only Calais remaining in English hands. England never again sought conquest on the Continent.
     
VI (174-176) The Church was an organization whose many thousands of members in their many diverse functions were a people apart from the rest of the community. A great part of the Church's activity seems to have been the collection of the funds supporting it. In 1250 the Church was very strong. By 1453 it had weakened considerably.
i. (176-180) The Conflict Between Pope Boniface VIII and the kings of England and France 1294 to 1303: Frederick II died in 1250 and replacing the old contest between the emperor and the pope was the new one of pope and rising national monarch, especially England and France. Both kings demanded clerical support of the royal treasury. Boniface Viii approved refusal without papal consent and did not give it. Edward I received payment from individual clerics. Philip the Fair had learned William of Nogaret conduct legal proceedings against Boniface. The pope, 86 years old, was seized, but strong popular support secured his release. Soon afterwards he died. Royal authority was strengthened, the papacy's diminished.
ii. (180-184) The Avignon residence of the Popes, 1305-1378: A succession of French popes established their residence at Avignon. There also dwelt some two dozen cardinals. Life there was more material, secular and worldly than pious and spiritual. Expensive Avignon was funded by a variety of taxes, dues and gifts, including fees for offices.
iii. (184-188) Anti-Papal Legislation: English kings disliked French popes making English appointments at a loss to the royal treasury. Parliament sent an envoy to Avignon to object. He achieved nothing. Parliament passed a law limiting papal authority in England. Talks failed to resolve the issue. English national pressures came from Parliament. English kings helped popes around Parliamentary restrictions. Other lands passed laws against papal appointments.
iv. (189-195) The Great Schism (1378-1415): Many long requests, Papal States unrest, Rome's decay, Brigands threatening Avignon, etc. prompted papal return to Peter's diocese. Urban VI's moves to improve the cardinals led them to appoint a rival, Clement VII, who, failing to conquer Rome, returned to Avignon. France and its allies recognized him. For fifty years, this split continued, with two popes hurling words and armies against each other.  Urban VI was succeeded by Boniface IX, Innocent VI and Gregory XII. Each side had national support and influence. Proposals for unity failed. Increased corruption funded two papal courts, administrations, military endeavours. The papacy's decline continued.
v. (195-199) The Period of Councils, 1409-1449: Cardinals calling a council was a much discussed solution. Following some smaller councils, cardinals at Pisa in 1409 named a third pope, Alexander V. His successor, John XXIII, called the ecumenical council to meet at Constance.
vi. (199-201) The Council of Constance to the Election of Martin V, 1414-1417: The Council of Constance had three aims: reunifying the papacy, opposing heresy and reforming the Church. Two popes abdicated, the third was deposed. Martin V was elected sole pope.
vii. (201-210) Mysticism and Heresy: Avignon, two popes and diminished spirituality cost esteem. Heresy, belief the Church condemned, was long viewed as treason against God. Mystics, such as Abbot Joachim, appealed to many in a disturbed age. Condemnation of heretical concepts, whether Abbot Joachim's or those of Echart's followers, no longer sufficed. Independent thought flourished, e.g. William of Ockham, Marsiglio and John of Jandun. Pope John XXIII denounced Ockham who returned the favor. Marsiglio's Defensor Pacis denied papal infallibility. John of Jandun joined Marsiglio and Ockham in moving to Munich and the protection of Lewis of Bavaria. Debating the orthodoxy of these monks largely involved scholars. Albigensian and Waldensian concepts had wide appeal. The Inquisition was established around 1250. Many accepted, and not only outwardly, the authority and teaching of the Church.

VII i. (211-216) John Wyclif: England, long spared Continental heresies, succumbed during the trying last half of the Fourteenth Century. Wyclif was brilliant and learned. He chose his Biblical understanding over Church teaching. He opposed Church material possessions and clerics in secular offices. He disliked Church hierarchical positions. He did not clearly accept transubstantiation. He was seldom questioned by Church authorities. The pope, provided with some of his alleged comments, denounced them and ordered his arrest. After some time, he was ordered to cease teaching what the pope opposed. He agreed, complied publicly and continued writing in private.
ii. (217-223) The Spread of Lollardy in England: Wyclif's opinions, Lollardy, were shared by many of all classes, though mainly commoners. He encouraged devotion and simple preachers. English translation of the Bible fostered understandings other than the Church's. Some people were blatantly irreverant.
iii. (223-227) The Suppression of English Lollardy: It took the Church thirty to fifty years to eradicate Lollardy. The effort made the Church more dependent on secular authority. The Church judged heresy and handed heretics over to civil officials for burning. England had no Inquisition, no torture. Many accused recanted, especially in the earlier period. Wyclif's books were burned. The Church's will prevailed over yearning for spirituality.
iv. (227-231) The Religious Wakening of Bohemia: Czech sentiment stirred. Czech culture, language, learning, literature, religion flourished. Bohemian preachers at first were orthodox, recanting if challenged. The Bible in Czech enabled variant views, augmented by close contact with England and its Lollardy.
v. (231-234) John Hus: Wyclif influenced many Czechs, most notably the scholar John Hus. Conservatives objected. Division appeared, chiefly orthodox Germans against unorthodox Czechs. Wyclif's books in Bohemia were burned. Hus, summoned to Rome, refused and was excommunicated, along with some supporters. Riots and civil strife occurred. Indulgences aroused opposition. King Wenzel sought to calm things, appealing to both conservatives and to Hus. Hus left Prague and continued writing. He was summoned to the Council of Constance.
vi. (234-238) Hus Before the Council of Constance: The Council condemned Wyclif, ordering his body expelled from sacred ground, an order carried out twelve years later. Hus attended the Council, under imperial safe conduct and with the Inquisition's testimony to his orthodoxy. He was arrested, imprisoned and questioned. The emperor objected, then gave in. The Church's chief concern was obedience. Hus's refusal condemned him. He was handed to civil authority and burned. Many considered his death martyrdom, rejecting Church authority. 
vii. (238-242) The Hussite Wars: Hus's burning enraged Bohemia. Hussites split in two and fought each other, burning churches, etc. Prague closed its gates to the new emperor and the king of Bohemia, Sigismund and defeated him in battle. Bohemian armies vanquished foreign forces hurled against them in five papally launched crusades. After eight defensive years, Bohemians invaded and devastated large areas of Germany. German reform efforts, including proposal for a German standing army, failed. 
viii (242-246) The End of the Councils: The Council of Basel negotiated an end to the Hussite Wars. The Church, Emperor and Bohemians (moderated, military eliminating extremists) reached agreement. Argument between Council and Pope, after an interlude of two Popes, saw Nicholas V reunite the Papacy. Serious attention was devoted to unifying Orthodox and Roman Christians. An agreement, accepted by the Byzantine Emperor, Patriarch  and Eastern Bishops, was rejected by most Byzantines. Council efforts to reform the Roman Church were largely unsuccessful.

VIII (247-248) This vibrant period saw the popular emergence of vernacular literature. Medieval mysticism and scholasticism declined; interest increased in Greek and Roman culture and attitudes, an interest continuing to exert influence into the present.
i. (248-249) The Prevalance of Latin and French: In 1250, Latin was the prevailing official language. As the period progressed, French became more used accross Europe. 
ii. (249-253) The Rise of Modern English: The Norman Conquest had not overcome common use of English. From c. 1250 there was more written English. The Fourteenth Century was a splendid English literary period, including Vision of Piers Plowman and the Canterbury tales.
iii. (253-254) The Use of Spanish in Records and Literature: Some Spanish documents occur earlier, but Alfonso X, the Wise was the main cause of the switch from Latin. Shortly after his accession in 1250, he made Castilian the official written language. He influenced a tremendous amount of Spanish literature from popular ballads to a translation of the Bible. Much Spanish literature appeared in the Fourteenth Century.
iv. (254-257): French of Paris: French had a number of dialects, some written. Paris's, the royal court's, the university's, became national, Classical French. By 1450, it had replaced Latin for secular documents. Numerous works, across a wide variety of genres, used polished Parisian French.
v. (257-261) Dante and the Italian Vernacular: Dante did not consider his day's Italian dialects fit for great literature. Yet, the Sicilian circle at Frederick II's court and Dante himself wrote well in a language developing well. Giovanni Vilani in his chronicle recorded his high opinion of Dante. Dante, an exile from Florence, lived his last years in the Ravenna. Boccaccio wrote a life of Dante and copied completely the Divine Comedy and sent it to Petrarch.
vi. (261-263) Boccaccio and the Decameron. Boccaccio, born in Paris in 1313, forming friendships at Naples's king Robert's court, a lifelong correspondent of Petrarch, travelling when young, settling at Florence in middle age, wrote elegant Latin letters, poetry in Latin and Italian, and, most notably, the Decameron. This collection of tales set in the 1348 background of the Black Death, in sharp contrast to Dante's Divine Comedy, presents only real people uninfluenced by higher spirituality. It was, until recently, on the Church's Index of Forbidden Books.
vii. (263-268) Petrarch and Knowledge of the Classics: Petrarch (1304-1375), a Florentine wanderer, friend of prominent people, crown of poets, calm student, thinker and writer (he had a delightful small farm near Avignon and later a house outside Padua) significantly influenced his age's admiration for Classical Latin literature. He did not know Greek. He ardently sought manuscripts, copying many to add to his library.
viii. (268-271) Humanism: Others, including Saluti, Bruni and Braccioline, collected, admired and studied Classical manuscripts. Many copyists were kept busy providing material for libraries. Petrarch read Greek authors in Latin translation. The generation after him produced scholars studying Greek in Italy and at Constantinople. 
ix. (271=275) New Movements in Art: Giotto influenced art as impressively as his friend Dante influenced literature. They were contemporaries, often in the same towns. Dante's Divine Comedy highly praises Giotto. Giotto's portrait of Dante survives, sole contemporary one to do so. Many artists serviced Italy's affluent patrons: individuals, governments, religious authorities. Cosimo de Medici was the great benefactor, erecting and beautifying buildings, gathering manuscripts, fostering art and literature.

IX (276-278) Italians early sailed throughout the Mediterranian and beyond Gibraltar, discovering the Canaries before 1300. Spain and Portugal employed Italians as captains and navigators. By 1350, the Madeiras and Azores were known. However, eastward exploration, inspired by religion and trade, was more impressive.
i. (278-289) The East as a Realm of Trading Adventure: In the mid 1200s, three Polo brothers were trading, two between Venice and Constantinople, the third on the Black Seas north coast. In 1260, the two visited their brother and continued east to Beijing. The Emperor, requesting learned Christians, provided them safe passage back. On reaching Italy, they found that the pope had died. Young Marco went east, impressed the Emperor, was appointed administrator. Marco describes: China's size, population, Grand Canal, amount of pepper consumed, luxurious life of its southern gentlemen, rich, cultured, secluded Japan fifteen hundred miles offshore, the many other islands beyond continental Asia, the desolate, sparsely populated far north to the Arctic Ocean. In 1278, he returned by the southern sea route, describing islands and lands from Java to Madagascar. In Italy, he was captured in the 1296 Battle of Curzola and imprisoned. Rusticiano, a fellow prisoner, recorded Marco's travel account. This, originally in French, then translated into Latin, Italian, etc., greatly enhanced European awareness of the Orient. Columbus's Latin copy is in the Seville library. All Marco describes is within the Polos' primary interest, trade.
ii. (289-294) The East as a Sphere of Missionay Enterprise: Religious fervor also propelled Europeans to Central and East Asia. The Extensive Mongol Empire permitted diplomats, merchants and missionaries to journey far. Many, especially Franciscans, went. Bishoprics and archbishoprics were established. Beijing had a cathedral in 1340. Written accounts of distant Asian religious endeavors survive. European travelers keenly sought Prester John, later identified with Ethiopia's ruler.
iii. (294-297) Compilations of Eastern Travels: A number of works survive, including a merchant's handbook and a proposal for economic sanctions against Egypt and Syria. Most popular is Sir John Mandeville's (actually Jean de Burgogne's)  fictional narrative. Other reports, written and oral, contributed to growing European familiarity with Asia. The vast Empire's collapse, conflict and Ming isolationism eliminated easy access, but there remained information already gained.

X (298) This area, largely Slavic, was highly unstable.
i. (298-302) Bohemia, Poland and Hungary: Briefly, extinguished native dynasties provided elected or distant in-law rulers. Bohemia's blind John of Luxemburg fell at Crecy. Poland and Hungary had Italian influenced kings. These lands advanced under three impressive mid Fourteenth Century rulers: Casimir, Louis and Charles IV. Economy (mining and trade) and culture flourished; universities were founded. Dynastic concerns included seeking to marry elected rulers to women from the deprived male royal line. Polish nobles frustrated Louis the Great's effort to have his daughter Mary wed Hungary and Bohemia's King Sigismund. She was crowned Queen of Poland in 1384 and married Lithuanian Grand Duke Jagellon in 1386.
ii. (302-304) The Teutonic Knights: Pagans in Prussia had been killed or drived east by crusading Germans. Germans settled the area and founded towns, some of them joining the Hanseatic League. Lithuania remained pagan, resisted Teutonic attacks and expanded (by arms and by marriage). Under Jagellon's father, Olgard (1341-1372), it stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea and east to Russia. Jagellon's wedding agreement included his baptism. His pagan subjects followed him, eliminating need for crusaders. The Teutons fought anyway and were decisively defeated at Tannenberg on July 15, 1410. Their fortress, Marienburg, fell a year later.
iii. (304-306) The Beginnings of Russian Greatness: Mary's death caused Jagellon to focus largely on Poland, leaving his cousin Witold to lead Lithuania. Witold clashed with Russia. Moscow's Dmitri defeated Lithuanian invaders and in 1380 famously won the Battle of Kulikovo against the Tartars.
iv. (306-308) The Serbian Empire of Stephen Dushan: The Byzantine Empire's decline and European disunity permitted Turkish advance. Serbia's Stephen Dushan (r. 1331-1355), building on his father's and grandfather's gains, established a strong state, reaching the Aegean. He keenly emulated imperial procedures, envisioning perhaps capturing, or rivalling, Constantinople. His state failed to long continue after his death, enabling ongoing Turkish expansion.               
v. (308-310) The Decay of the Eastern Empire: Loss of land, population, manpower, taxes from land and commerce impeded the Empire's ability to fight, forcing it to rely more on less dependable and more unruly mercenaries.
vi. (310-314) The Entrance of the Ottoman Turks into Europe: Turks entered European history when they crossed the Dardanelles in the mid Fourteenth Century. Turks were cavalrymen, relying on sons of conquered peoples to be trained as elite infantry, Janissaries. They also had irregular troops(foot and mounted) and artillery. The Turks allowed freedom of religion, on the payment of a tax. In 1345, Osmanli Turks entered Europe to support the Byzantine usurper John Cantacuzenos. They fought for the Empire against Serbs and for Genoa against Venice. They came as invaders and settlers. In 1363, the Emperor acknowledged the sultan as his sovereign and began paying tribute. 
vii. (314-325) The Conquest of Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece: The Turks pushed into the Balkans; the Serbs had varying results resisting. While Sultan Murad was distracted in Asia Minor, Serbs were victorious. Combined Serb and allied forces faced the returning Murad on June 11, 1389. His army triumphed, though he himself was killed. The Ottomans pushed into Bulgaria, conquering it and converting or replacing its population. Byzantine emperors repeatedly pleaded for Western help. A crusade was called. An emperor offered Roman-Orthodox Church union. Italian trading cities sought good relations with the Turks. Poland's King Casimir the Great called for united opposition. A joint force was defeated in 1364. In 1396, a very large European force, including many French knights, attacked the Turks. In the Battle of Nicopolis, they initially defeated irregulars, only then to be badly beated by elite regulars. As Christians had killed prisoners, the Turks executed many captives. The Ottomans launched punitive Balkan raids, then in 1402 called on Constantinople to surrender. Tamerlane intervened. He bested the Sultan's army at Angora on July 20, 1402. The Sultan was taken prisoner and died the next year in captivity. Tamerlane died in 1405 and his empire disintegrated. For decades, Europeans fought fiercely for independence. The Sultan struck hard against truce breakers. On November 10, 1444, he defeated the Europeans at Varna, killing Hungarian King Ladislas. The Turks thrust further into the Balkans, then turned to Constantinople. 
viii. (325-327) The Fall of Constantinople: Thrice, distractions lifted Turkish sieges: the Westerners at Nicopolis, Tamerlane and in 1422 a serious rebellion in Asia Minor. Now, well prepared and unthreatened elsewhere, Sultan Muhammad II, in April called on Constantinople to surrender. Constantine XI refused. The previously invincible walls faced very powerful artillery. Four assaults: April 18, May 7, May 12 and May 21 were repelled. The one on May 29 succeeded. Constantine XI died fighting. Constantinople became the Ottoman capital.

XI i. (328-334) The Unity of History: Across Europe, there was common experience: fading feudalism, growing capitalism, towns, centralization, vernacular languages, etc. Some causes are clear: the rising middle class wanting a representative voice, Black Death devastation leading workers to press for higher wages and authorities to insist that workers work and at previous rates. There was a general Fifteenth Century growth in royal power. Cities and leagues of cities grew. Public preaching and heresy spread. Popular, unrestrained rebellion occurred widely.
ii. (335-337) The Idea of Nationality: Especially exemplified in the Hundred Years War, with its evidence of English and growth of French patriotic fervor, national feeling seems to largely begin in this period, across the Continent. The rise of vernacular literatures is another aspect of this trend.
iii. (337-339) The Continuity of History: History contains coincidences, but also consistent developments. Transitions enable perceptions of continuity. Increased monarchical might and Turkish expansion presaged coming wars. The weakening Church seemed destined to split in face of intensifying popular and regal religious dissatisfaction. Advances in exploration, commerce, trade, scientific and intellectual endeavor appear inevitable.  As Cheyney concludes his text: "The most conspicuous characteristic of this period was its assurance that it was introductory to a new era." p. 339     Micharl McKenny completed this summary around noon on January 2, 2020
