<H1>Bio and Bibliography</H1>

Welcome to this enhanced bio section offering Michael McKenny's novel Rainbow, a brief description of the novel, a bio, bibliography and brief outline of human research topics. This was last updated on September 30, 2008 C.E. with a minor edit.

For more than twenty years, bios have appeared accompanying Michael McKenny's published work and some were posted to cyberspace fora he was joining. This one here is simply the most recent. Also below is an initial attempt to compile a list of Michael McKenny's writings in hard copy, in cyberspace and unpublished. One who has moved around a bit, tossed stuff out and had a traditional attitude to his literary talent, he has not made it possible to locate, or even list, everything. Nevertheless, here's a start.<p>
