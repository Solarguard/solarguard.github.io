One of the arguments raised against the new Constitution is that it
concerns so diverse and varied a populace as to be unworkable. As
John Jay remarked:

   With equal pleasure I have as often taken notice that Providence
   has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united
   people--a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the
   same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same
   principles of government, very similar in their manners and
   customs, and who, by their joint counsels, arms and efforts,
   fighting side by side in a long and bloody war, have nobly
   established general liberty and independence.

How very different some assert are the circumstances confronting
those called upon to approve the new Constitution for the peoples of
the entire planet, composed of all the languages, religions,
cultures, modes of governance, historical traditions, social systems
and customs, who, far from sharing the same victorious war for
national liberation, include all the living opposing combatants from
all the conflicts of the current generation.

Yet, as preposterous and ludicrous as such a concept of forming an
effective union of so very different individuals, groups and states
may strike many on the first unconsidered encounter, deeper analysis
illuminates the wholesome and attainable character of this supreme
planetary objective.

First, whatever were the conditions in the newly independent United
States of America when Jay penned his words on the considerable
similarity shared by so many of their inhabitants, waves of
immigrants from Catholic Ireland, from the Germanic, Slavic and
Romance countries of Europe, from the Middle East, East Asia, Africa
and everywhere else on the planet have so enriched the fabric of
America's population that it can evidence, along with such nations
as Brazil and Canada, the splendid benefits of pluralism.

There is the sentiment that the USA was the initial extensive
republican federation in human history. At its outset, Jay's
reasonable approach was to focus on the so many common
characteristics of the majority of its population. A similar
approach would logically suggest that human beings, the residents of
a single small planet, the descendants of common ancestors, members
of one species, partinipating in a system of global communications
are actually now closer to each other that someone of Jay's
generation could have envisioned. It can, indeed, easily be
suggested that in many respects those now able to embrace the new
Union of Earth enjoy greater advantages than those who successfully
demonstrated the practicality of the Eighteenth Century
Constitution.

Further, federalism has been extended successfully to many lands and
proved the possibility of accommodating within a single nation
peoples of very different backgrounds. Realistic assessment of
history, of current affairs and of short term future prospects
allows both approval of the Constitution as the best structured
format for human peace, well-being and security and continuous,
strenuous and attentive efforts to overcome natural fragmentary
tendencies.

While each great Terran system of thought and belief, including
Confucianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam and
Marxism, clearly contains a broad perspective, an elevated sight, an
all-embracing inclusiveness, yet, the normal inclination to think of
personal and private advantage, to look at particular identities, to
hesitate to accept the over-arching awareness of the species
requires systematic, structured and well-considered measures to
safeguard human rights, individual, group and global.

It may well be a challenge, especially for highly competitive
personalities, to accept the value of other individuals, to see the
worth of refraining from derogatory remarks about others. However,
while state jurisdiction over education can better ensure the
preservation, promotion and efflorescence of Terra's many languages,
faiths and ways, it is a duty of the federal government to ensure
such education is free from prejudicial incitements against others.
It is obvious to any honest observer that human children unfettered
by dogmatic instructions to the contrary can grow in an atmosphere
of open-minded acceptance and appreciation of the healthy harvest of
this planet's diversity.

This and other aspects of the new Constitution will be further
advanced in future installments of these Twenty First Century
Papers.
