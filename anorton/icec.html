ICE CROWN, Andre Norton, Ace, New York, 1970

A scientific expedition is sent to the recently rediscovered planet of
Clio. This world had been colonized by subjects of a psychological
experiment. Generations have passed and the inhabitants of Clio are
unaware of the galactic civilization that exists beyond their horizons.

Roane, niece of the expedition's leader, becomes very much involved in
the goings on of the Medieval like life on Clio. This is typical Norton:
a youthful, resourceful protagonist facing challenges in an interesting
setting. It is well worth the read.
