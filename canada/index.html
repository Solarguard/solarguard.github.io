Canada is approaching the centennial of its Confederation. 
This is pretty good time to begin adding to this Solarguard 
webpage a Canadian section. The intent is to place here, 
as that date approaches, articles and reviews on the theme 
of Canadian history, current affairs and awesome future 
potential. The section is launched with Michael McKenny's 
short article on the vision of Ralph Centennius' 1883 vision 
of Canada and Michael McKenny's letter to Canada's prime 
minister on the subject of housing veterans. October 2010.
