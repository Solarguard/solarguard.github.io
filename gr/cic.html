M. Tullius Cicero

Marcus Tullius Cicero (January 3, 106-December 7, 43 B.C.E.) was an
orator and author whose impressive Latin was perceived by many over
the centuries as the epitome of prose in that language. As one who
set the highest standard his works were much copied and studied. As
an orator, one very adept in the spoken sound, his works are meant
to be read aloud. Even in translation, enunciating his texts can
present something very powerful.

The popular Penguin editions provide the English reader with eight
volumes of Cicero's works: three of letters (those to Atticus and
the two volume collection to his friends), selected court cases and
selected political speeches, two philosophical volumes, The Nature
of the Gods and a collection titled On the Good Life and, finally,
a collection called Selected Works.

Cicero's powerful oratory made him a prominent lawyer and political
figure. He was elected consul in 63 B.C.E., the first person in a
generation not born an aristocrat to attain this highest office. His
vision of class harmony encountered the vicious contention of
ambitious men and fierce party factionalism. His ardent opposition
to autocracy made him powerful enemies and eventually claimed his
life. He was killed on December 7, 43 B.C.E.

His voluminous writings, especially his many letters, render him
perhaps the Classical person moderns most know. Disclosed is a very
human individual, tolerant, humane, somewhat vain, concerned with
future perception of him, restorer of Archimedes' neglected tomb,
appealing for the preservation of Epicurus' house, uneasy in the
presence of armed guards in the Senate, nervous corresponding with
the polymath Varro, grieving for a deceased slave and devastated at
the death of his daughter.

Near the end of his life he quickly composes a number of dialogues
conveying to Latin readers the essence of Greek philosophy. These
helped provide in the Latin tongue and in the European languages
influenced by it (including English) the terminology as well as the
concepts of higher thought.

Cicero was a seminal figure in the evolution of the highest and best
ideals of Western man.
