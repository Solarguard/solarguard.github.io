<h3>EUROPE'S RISE</h3>

<p>
In the early 1930s, some American historians were keen to examine how it could have happened that Europe, so civilized, could have produced the Great War. Led by William L. Langer and Harvard University, they produced a series of twenty volumes, The Rise of Modern Europe, published over a fifty year period, covering Europe's history from 1250 to 1945. In 1967, Michael McKenny, taking Modern European History as one of his courses at St Patrick's College in Ottawa, had the volumes on the French Revolution (v. 11) and on the Napoleonic Empire (v. 12) as text books. Over many years he collected the other eighteen books, ten of them obtained through the help of his friend Michel Boucher, who ordered them on the Internet. Michael McKenny then summsrized all twenty for his personal study. His summary, book by book, is provided here. Kindly note that initially Michael hand printed this summary placing the loose leaf sheets in four binders. He is now gradually typing these up on the computer and e-mailing them to his son, Kevin McKenny, who, with Michael's deep gratitude, is placing them on the Solarguard webpage. The summary of volumes 3 and 4 are being left for last.
