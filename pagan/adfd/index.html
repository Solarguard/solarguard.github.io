<h1>ADFD</h1>

<p>Welcome<p>

This page was created on August 13, 2003, collecting from the main Pagan page the files connected with the ADF Dedicants' Program. This is the very interesting introductory study program of ADF. Michael McKenny completed this in September 2000 and on being informed in July 2003 that documentation was missing, promptly replaced and rewrote it as follows below. A certificate of completion dated July 6, 2003 is now placed above an entranceway of his residence:<p>
May what is here be interesting to whomever may read it.<p>
