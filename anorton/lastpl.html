Brief notes on this novel appear after the review below. These are by 
no means comprehensive, though they are adequate to place this early 
work (though among the last in the chronology of galactic civilization
stories) as an interesting one within the Andre Norton SF universe(s).

THE LAST PLANET, Andre Norton, Ace, 1953, reviewed here June 18, 2002

This is the first Andre Norton story I read. I recall it was Michel Rene
de Cotret who loaned me a copy in high school, back around 1966. A few
years later in university, at St. Patrick's College, we had a French
assignment "My favourite character" and I wrote about three times the
required word limit answering that it was Ranger Sergeant Katr.

This book is fascinating for a number of reasons that when analyzed seem
surprising. I very much felt here the thrill of travelling between
planets, of journeying to other solar systems, of exploring strange new
worlds. Yet, as the blurb says, there is no star hopping here. The five 
year mission has come to an end with the crash of the Vega scout Star Fire
on its last world, hence the title. Yet, this masterful storyteller does
convey that glimpse of such a civilization spanning the stars. 

It's also great to see the unfolding exploration of that curious planet,
with its initial wilderness, then evidence of previous high civilization
followed by the intrusion of political intrigue with the refugees from
the collapsing galactic empire.

One of the most vital, essential and beneficial aspects of my thought I
attribute to Andre Norton. Unlike Heinlein she is not really one to get up
on a soap box and preach. Her characters live their lives, accept the
consequences and make choices that convey her cosmopolitan and prejudice
conquering vision. In this story the galactic empire is human dominated.
There are other species, but humans are in control. The hero stands
against the prevailing anti-Bemmy prejudice. Well, prior to my exposure
to Andre Norton I was a bit of a nationalist, as easy to see us vs them as
too many others in this still evolving species. However, as a consequence
of her humanity, in the loftiest sense of the word, I quickly recognized
the essential reality and the necessity of accepting the diverse unity
not just of Terrans, but of all intelligent life forms.

This book introduces her long-lived, pacific, historically studious
Zacathans. I have always enjoyed these guys, being a studious one so
very interested in history myself, and, if only the gods willed, I'd
gladly accept a Zacathan lifespan and the appropriately peaceful 
environment to go with it. 

Another aspect of this book is the very believable way she handles
telepathy. The whole psi thing is very well done, especially for something
half a century old. Since then SF has had a long time to try to refine,
develop and augment portrayal of psi powers. This book presents them in
operation as normal as any of the more mechanical aspects of that future
civilization. 

The book's ending is dismissed these days as cliche. However, to a 16 year
old student reading a 1953 story, it was mind blowing. I loved it. I very
much enjoyed the entire book, from the prologue about the lost Roman
legion (I memorized that prologue and recall reciting the beginning of it
at a meeting of the Ottawa SF Society a decade or more ago) to that so
thrilling realization of just where they had landed and then the broad
sweep of history as to the seeds of the birth of the Second Empire. 

Andre Norton describes a universe so fallible, so imperfect, so filled 
with the pessimism of one who lived through the Depression and World War
II, yet presents the teenagers she wrote for with action packed adventures
where young people develop self-reliance in that unfriendly environment.
This was the first really good SF book I read, the first of many by this 
so captivating author.

A footnote to the above review is that the inspiring prologue of this 
novel so resonated with Susan Shwartz that she co-authored with Andre 
Norton a novel about a Roman survival in Asia, as referenced in that 
prologue. This is the 1993 Empire of the Eagle also based on Chinese
historical accounts.
