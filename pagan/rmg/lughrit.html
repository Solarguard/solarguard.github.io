1. Prebriefing. We run through the coming rit, so all know what to
expect and everything is prepared.

2. Bellringing druid rings bell thrice.

3. Procession to the location of the ritual. A nifty chant could be sung
here. "We are walking to the grove" is one option. Circling the sacred
centre three times (deasil, sunwise) seems like a sweet thing to do.

4. Gatekeeping druid.

Manannan, Lyr's son, welcome be.
Misty ferryman, guide us all,
Receive our gift and heed our call,
Bear us across to mystery.

5. Meditative druid does tree rooting meditation.

6. Statement of Purpose:

Maeve's druid:

Long past when solar wheel was here,
Our tribes arrived from far and near
Honouring Lugh and Maeve and all
Favouring gods, spirits recall.

Lugh's druid:

Again the spinning wheel is here,
Our people come from far and near,
To honour Maeve and Lugh and all
Favouring gods, spirits recall.

7. Invitation of the Three Kindred

Ancestral druid:

To you ahead on life's highway,
Abiding here ages before,
Receive this gift and heed us more.
Attend again, welcome today.

Natural druid:

Favouring ones around us near,
O you of earth, air, tree and stream,
Natural ones we so esteem,
Receive this gift and join us here.

High Ones druid:

O lofty lords and ladies high,
Now you're invited by our tribe,
Come join this feast, partake, imbibe,
Receive this gift, in fun let's vie.

8. Keeping away outdwellers

Druid keeping away outdwellers: "Be there any entities unfavourable
to this gathering, take you this gift and take your leave of us."

9. Invitation of Main Deities

Maeve's druid:

O mighty Maeve! O shield of lands!
Enfolding us within your hands,
O birthing earth, exceeding worth!
Receive this gift and join our mirth.

Lugh's druid:

O long armed Lugh, so skilled in all,
O Lord of Light, we send our call.
Receive our gift inviting Thee 
And join this feast so cheerfully. 

10. Individual Offerings.

Maeve's druid:

Let now everyone so wishing

Lugh's druid:

Present the gods an offering.

11. Divination:

Divining druid does the ogham reading. If it is I doing the normal
Red Maple ogham reading, I'll begin with something like:

"We have addressed this day our deities; now it is our turn to listen
to them."

Then I'll draw three oghams, one at a time, from the bag: past,
present and future. I'll name them and say a few words about their
meaning. Then a ritual question is asked: "Our gods have spoken to us.
Are we satisfied, or would we hear more." If the reading is especially
challenging, then an additional explanatory ogham may be drawn from the
bag. Each seer has a valid individual way of doing this. The gods know
who it is they're addressing and speak accordingly.

12. Communal Sharing. Here is passed around our communal drink. This
would be a good time for a lively chant.

13. Thanking the Main Deities

Lugh's druid:

O skilled in all, O long armed Lugh,
So gratefully we welcomed you,
If you desire, be on your way,
Or stay with us longer today. 

Maeve's druid:

O Mighty Maeve, O shield of lands,
Enfolding us within your hands,
O birthing Earth, exceeding worth,
Our grateful thanks you joined our mirth.

14. Thanking the Three Kindred

High Ones druid:

O deities we knew before,
O Ladies, Lords of ancient lore,
Receive our thanks in bright array
For being here in joy today.

Natural druid:

O nature spirits we esteem,
O you of air, earth, tree and stream,
Receive our thanks in bright array
For being here in joy today.

Ancestral druid:

To you ahead on life's highway,
Abiding here in times before,
Receive our grateful thanks and more
For being here in joy today.

Manannan's druid:

Manannan, Lyr's son, thanked Thou be.
Misty ferryman, thank we all
For favoured gifts and heeded call.
Now guide us please from mystery. 

15. Meditative druid does Tree Unrooting Exercise

16. Closing Statement

Lugh's druid:

As thanked our guests divine have been,
Let's thank the mortal guests we've seen.

Maeve's druid:

To each and all, let good extend.
let all be well, the rit now end.

Bellringing druid rings bell thrice.

There is an opportunity to process away from sacred space perhaps
singing a nifty chant.

As this is Lughnasad, it would not be unfitting for there to be at
least a symbolic race, if not more extensive celebratory games.
