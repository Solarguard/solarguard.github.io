ORKNEYINGA SAGA, transl. Hermann Palsson and Paul Edwards, Penguin,
Harmondsworth, 1984 (1978). For the summary of the first half of this
text follow the link at the end of this summary.

LVI. Paul was well liked. There were many respectable people then on
the Orkneys.

LVII. Many marvellous things happened to demonstrate the sanctity of
Earl Magnus. Among the stories of the curing of lepers, the blind
and insane, the arising of favourable weather and dreams is that of
the dice player who called on St. Magnus when opposed by two sixes
and then won when one of his dice broke and he got two sixes and a
one.

LVIII. Kali Kolsson in Norway was multitalented, skilled at chess
and runes, among other things.

LIX. Kali sailed to England, where he met Harald son of Magnus Bare-
Legs.

LX. Kali returned to Norway, where in Bergen he met Jon Petersson.

LXI. Kali went into Dolls Cave, swimming across the lake there.
Kali's companion Havard and Brynjolf, one of Jon's friends, came to
blows and Brynjolf killed Havard. Kali avenged that death. Jon rode
with sixty men to launch a surprise attack, but Kali's father
learned of this and met it with a larger force. Many of Jon's men
were killed and he himself walked with a limp ever after. The king
settled this dispute. Jon married Kali's sister. Kali was given half
of the Orkneys and named Rognvald by the king.

LXII. King Sigurd died and Magnus became king at Oslo and Harald at
Tonsberg. After three years they fought and Harald fled to Denmark.
He returned victoriously and confirmed Rognvald's earldom in Orkney.

LXIII. Earl Paul refused to share the Orkneys. Kol sent envoys on
behalf of his son to Frakokk in Scotland who agreed to support
Rognvald.

LXIV. Rognvald and Frakokk set out from Norway and Scotland.

LXV. Frakokk's forces were engaged first. Svein Breast-Rope, one who
practised the old ways, turned the tide of the battle in favour of
Paul. Paul sailed then to the Shetlands, but Rognvald refused to
fight on sea, and Paul wouldn't fight on land. Rognvald returned to
Norway with the friendship of the Shetlanders.

LXVI. Paul celebrated his victory, and ordered beacons set up to
allow news of any future invasion to be known widely and spread
rapidly. Valthjof Olafsson, died with his crew when its ship sank on
its way to Paul's Christmas feast. Valthjof's father died with five
other men when Olvir, Frakokk's grandson burned the house. Svein
Asleifarson killed Svein Breast-Rope, who mistakenly killed Jon as
he died.

LXVII. The earl learned that Bishop William had helped Svein
Asleifarson and was advised to treat both of them well, considering
Rognvald's impending invasion. Kol prepared Rognvald's force.

LXVIII. Rognvald vowed that if were victorious he would build an
impressive stone minster for St. Magnus.

LXIX. Kol had ships sail within sight of the beacon on Fair Isle,
and then, as the beacon system lit up, sail back to the Shetlands.

LXX. Troops assembled and nothing happened. After three days,
tempers flared, and even there was fighting. One of Rognvald's men
went to Fair Isle and volunteered to watch the beacon. He doused it
with water and slipped away.

LXXI. Rognvald landed on Westray. The people there took an oath to
him.

LXXII. Rognvald learned of a plot against him and attended a meeting
of the conspirators. They begged forgiveness.

LXXIII. Earl Paul was advised to come to terms, or buy off Rognvald.
The Bishop was asked to mediate. The Orkneys were divided between
Paul and Rognvald. Two relatives of Svein Asleifarson burned Thorkel
Flayer and eight men in his house. These killers then joined
Rognvald.

LXXIV. Svein Asleifarson sailing in a cargo ship and pretending to
be a merchant found the location of Earl Paul and captured him after
a fight in which Svein lost six men and the earl nineteen. Svein
took Paul to Earl Maddad and Margaret, Maddad's wife and Paul's
sister.

LXXV. Various are the accounts of Paul's end. The nicest are that he
went into a monastery and the word was put out incorrectly that he
was blinded.

LXXVI. Earl Paul's absence was noted. Some thought Frakokk was
behind it. Some swore allegiance to Rognvald. Others waited to hear
word of Paul. Svein Asleifarson came to one of Rognvald's assemblies
seeking a truce and bearing the news of Earl Paul's capture and
mutilation. Everyone joined Rognvald. St. Magnus' minster was built
and paid for by the farmers buying their land.

LXXVII. Earl Maddad's son Harald became earl of half of the Orkneys,
though under Rognvald.

LXXVIII. Svein Asleifarson decided to avenge the death of his
father. Rognvald was asked for and provided two ships. Svein sailed
to Scotland where Maddad gave him guides who brought him to
Frakokk's farmhouse from an unexpected direction. Olvir and his
sixty men were quickly defeated. Olvir escaped, but the farmhouse
was burned with Frakokk in it. Svein plundered and then returned
home. Later he was asked for aid by Holdbodi. Rognvald again allowed
Svein two ships. Svein and Holdbodi raided Wales, whence came Robert
an Englishman active in the North.

LXXIX. Ingirid, widow of one of Robert's victims, married Svein.
Holdbodi quietly came to terms with Robert. Svein raided in Ireland
and took a ship owned by the monks of the Scilly Isles. Holdbodi,
led a force with torches towards Svein's hall. Svein and his men
went to a hill, sounded a trumpet and with reinforcements attached
and scattered the attackers. Holdbodi fled to Lundy Isle sold his
holding and left the Hebrides.

LXXX. Thorbjorn Clerk had two of the burners of Frakokk killed. This
angered Svein, but Rognvald reconciled them.

LXXXI. Hall Thorarinsson at first was rejected when he sought to
join Rognvald. He was a poet, and after he became one of the earl's
retinue, Rognvald and he:

   composed The Old Key of Metres, using five verses to illustrate
   each metre: but in these days only two are used as the poem was
   thought too long. p. 149

LXXXII. Svein led five ships to the Hebrides after Holdbodi.
Holdbodi escaped, but there was a lot of plundering. Thorbjorn Clerk
and other captains felt unjustly treated, when Svein took a greater
share of the spoils. Rognvald compensated Thorbjorn the difference
and told him to keep quiet about Svein's bullying, which would be
taken care of in the future. Svein with some sixty men held a strong
fort on a Scottish cliff, emerging to plunder.

LXXXIII. Earl Rognvald led a force to this castle and asked Svein to
hand over Margad, one of those with Svein. Svein refused and his
castle was beseiged. Svein and Margad escaped by rope to the sea,
and thence to Edinburg and David King of the Scots. Margad stayed
with the Scottish king. Svein asked David for reconciliation between
Rognvald and Svein. This was done and Svein went home.

LXXXIV. The castle had surrendered to Rognvald, who gave all in it
leave to go. Thorbjorn led a force to Moray Firth hunting for Margad
and Svein. He led it to the hall of Valthjof, who had killed
Thorbjorn's father, set that hall ablaze and killed Valthjof and
thirty of Valthjof's men, as they came out.

LXXXV. King Ingi of Norway invited Rognvald to visit. Rognvald and
Earl Harald went and met Ingi at Bergen. There he heard Eindridi
speak of his time as a mercenary in Constantinople. Rognvald said he
would go to the Holy Land. First, he sailed to the Orkneys. A gale
forced him ashore in the Shetlands. He stayed in good spirits,
composing poetry. He went fishing there and wasn't recognized. He
came back to the Orkneys. He received two Icelanders, Armod and Oddi
Glumsson, both poets. Rognvald exchanged verses with them. He sailed
to Norway, gathered there those going with him to the Holy Land and
returned to the Orkneys. There were some disputes between Norwegians
and Orkneymen. The earl paid recompense for many, including the
slaying of Eindridi's man Arni Pin-Leg, who had refused to pay a
debt.

LXXXVI. Rognvald sailed leading fifteen ships. The Lady of Narbonne
entertained them very well. In Galicia the people urged them to
attack a castle held by a bullying lord. They began to gather timber
to burn the castle. Lord Godfrey came dressed as a beggar from the
castle. He learned of differences between Eindridi's men and the
earl's and made a secret agreement with Eindridi.

LXXXVII. Rognvald led an attack on the castle. The fire melted the
mortar and large gaps appeared in the castle walls. The castle fell.
Many of its defenders were killed, some surrendered and were spared.
Lord Godfrey got away and suspicion fell on Eindridi, who'd led the
attack on the north wall. They plundered "pagan" areas of Spain,
sailed through Gibraltar, and into the Mediterranean, where they saw
a ship called a dromond and prepared to attack it.

LXXXVIII. Some hacked through the iron-plated wood of the dromond,
while others were firing arrows. Once aboard, there was fierce
fighting. Rognvald ordered the Saracen leader captured. He was very
disturbed when he watched his ship burnt. They sailed to Africa, and
when no one would buy him, they let him and five others go. Rognvald
led his ships on to Crete and then Acre, where many died of illness.
Rognvald went on to Jerusalem and swam across the Jordan River. Then
it was on to Constantinople by way of Imbolum and Engilsness.

LXXXIX. At Constantinople, Emperor Menelaus and his Varangians
welcomed Earl Rognvald. Afterwards, Rognvald sailed to Bulgaria and
thence he rode to Rome and took the pilgrim way to Denmark. He went
on to Norway.

XC. Rognvald stayed a while in Hordaland, catching up on news from
the Orkneys, where Earl Harald was opposed by Svein Asleifarson and
Earl Erlend. He sailed with an Icelander to Scotland and arrived in
the Orkneys just before Christmas.

XCI. King Eystein came to Orkney. Earl Harald pledged allegiance to
the king. Eystein proceeded to Scotland and then England, where he
claimed his looting was vengeance for the killing of King Harald
Sigurdarson.

XCII. Harald faced a claim from Earl Erlend of Caithness and
Erlend's counsellor Anakol. Harald refused to cede half of the
Orkneys, unless King Eystein so ruled. Svein Asleifarson seized a
cargo ship from Earl Harald's men, and took other stuff in the
Orkneys. He visited the Scottish king, returned north, made peace
with Anakol's relative, met Erlend returning with Eystein's decree
Erlend could have Harald's part of the Orkneys. Harald saw them
coming and withdrew into the fortress at Cairston. Others tried to
mediate, but this failed, until Harald agreed to give up his part of
the Orkneys. Farmers swore allegiance to Erlend.

XCIII. Earl Harald went to the Orkneys with a hundred men. He
captured Anakol's brother Arnfinn and a few others and returned to
Scotland. Harald offered to trade Arnfinn for the cargo ship. Svein
captured Harald's man Eirik and proposed to trade him for Arnfinn.
Erlend and Harald were reconciled, with Erlend marrying Harald's
mother Margaret. Svein and Erlend plundered in Scotland. Svein took
a ship belonging to Knut the wealthy, avoided the fourteen ships
sent to take him, and on his way to the Scottish king met men coming
from the king to ransome Svein. Svein proved the rumour of his
captivity false and received a fine shield from the king.

XCIV. Earl Rognvald arrived and efforts were made to mediate between
him and Erlend. It was agreed each would rule half the Orkneys.
Erlend went to the Shetlands to face Harald, when Harald arrived
from Norway. Erlend took three of Harald's ships, but Harald reached
the Orkneys with four others. Harald went to see Rognvald in
Scotland. They got along well. Rognvald went toward his estate at
Ophir, stopping at the place of Botolf, an Icelander and a poet.
Erlend launched a surprise attack against Harald. A hundred men died
in the fighting. Erlend's men came seeking Rognvald. Botolf
misdirected them and woke Rognvald, who went to Ophir, where he
found Harald. The earls sailed to Scotland. Erlend and Svein went to
Scotland. Svein went to visit kin, warning Erlend to be careful.
Erlend was surprised by Harald and Rognvald and killed.

XCV. Svein slew one, who was boasting he'd slain Erlend. Rognvald
sought to reconcile Svein and Harald. Harald used Svein's grain
freely. Against Rognvald's advice, Svein went to confront Harald.
However, when Harald sailed towards Svein, the odds looked to be too
much in Harald's favour, so Svein his his ship in the large cave on
Hellis Island. Then Svein went to the place of his kinsman Bard and
was hidden in a secret room there. Svein couldn't stand the talk of
John Wing, who came calling on Bard. He came out to get at Jon, who
fled to another farmhouse so hastily he didn't take time to dress
for winter and lost some toes from the cold. Svein went near another
cave.

XCVI. Earl Rognvald sailed to where Svein was.

XCVII. Rognvald urged Svein to seek reconciliation with Harald.
Amundi Hnefason mediated. Svein captured Jon Wing's brothers, but
let them go. John Wing captured Svein's son Olaf, but Rognvald saw
Olaf and told Jon to let Olaf go.

XCVIII. Svein came to the Orkneys from the Hebrides, made one who'd
been at the Erlend's killing pay ransom and visited Earl Rognvald.

XCIX. Earl Harald gave Svein a tunic, cloak, ship and half of
Harald's property, saying this reconciliation must last.

C. Thorbjorn Clerk became Earl Harald's counsellor, but Thorbjorn's
men clashed with Rognvald's. Rognvald outlawed Thorbjorn. Thorbjorn
went to King Malcolm in Scotland. A bully named Gilla Odran caused a
lot of trouble to King Malcolm and to Earl Rognvald.

CI. Svein went a-viking. He killed Gilla Odran amongst others.

CII. Thorbjorn Clerk visited friends in Caithness.

CIII. Earl Rognvald visited Caithness, where he was surprised and
killed by Thorbjorn and Thorbjorn's men. Harald pursued the killers.
Harald refused to kill Thorbjorn, but others fought Thorbjorn, drove
him to a house and burned it.

CIV. Earl Rognvald was buried at St. Magnus' Cathedral to great
mourning.

CV. Earl Harald had four children, one of whom, Hakon, was fostered
by Svein Asleifarson. Svein used to conduct two viking trips a year.

CVI. On one viking raid, Svein took cloth and mead from two English
ships bound for Dublin. Earl Harald encouraged Svein to give up
raiding.

CVII. Svein decided on one last raid. He raided as far as Dublin,
and even took the town. However, the Dubliners hid armed men in pits
covered with straw.

CVIII. When Svein and his men entered Dublin, crowds left free the
space above the pits. Svein and those with him who fell into the
pits were slain.

CIX. Rognvald's grandson Harald asked Earl Harald to give him half
the Orkneys. Earl Harald refused and raised a large force. There was
a fight and Harald the Young was killed.

CX. The Scottish King William was upset that his earl, Harald the
Young, was killed.

CXI. Earl Harald came with a large force and reasserted his control
of Caithness.

CXII. The Scottish king raised a very large force and led it to
Caithness. Negotiations resulted in Harald being acknowledged as the
king's liegeman in Caithness, with a quarter of the Caithness
revenue belonging to the king. Afterwards, some Orkneymen fell
fighting for Sigurd against King Sverrir in Norway. Earl Harald went
to Norway to mollify Sverrir's anger. The Norwegian king removed the
Shetlands from Harald's control. Harald was Orkney earl for forty
eight years.

This volume also has an eighteen page glossary of personal names, a
genealogical chart, maps and list of place names. It is a priceless
primary source for the history of the area and period.
