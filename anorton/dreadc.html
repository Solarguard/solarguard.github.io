DREAD COMPANION, Andre Norton, Ace, New York, 1970

Kilda has been raised in an orphanage for the offspring of space service
personnel. She is a young woman well trained in historical research and
the use of computer libraries. She leaves the orphanage to become tutor
to two young children of a family posted to a frontier planet. The
daughter demonstrates possible psychic ability and possesses a dread
companion that seems something other than a pleasant imaginary friend.

A quick trip to a wilderness area turns into quite an adventure as Kilda
and the children under her care slip into an alternate universe, a
fairyland both enchanting and hazardous for the unwary.

This encounter with the otherworldliness of elfland is well told by a
writer quite aware of such accounts in actual Earth history. This is a
finely spun yarn likely to hold the interest all the way to the end, an
end well in keeping with such stories of people straying into the realm
of Fairyland.
