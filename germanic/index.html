The early Germanic peoples produced a rich harvest of the virtues of an heroic society: individual honour, loyalty to family and leaders, irrepressible courage, keen linguistic capacity and deep mysticism. At present this site offers some dozen Michael McKenny reviews, his modern English version of the Old English poem "The Ruin", his preliminary understanding of the Old Germanic futhark (runes), the fascinating description from Eric's Saga of a seeress in Greenland, and a glimpse of the game hnefetafl, as it is played in his household. There's a link below to Michael's reviews of four books on the runes, including Freya Aswynn's, Edred Thorsson's and Jennifer Smith's and his review of Jenni Blain's NINE WORLDS OF SEIDR MAGIC. This was last updated on January 2, 2008 with the addition of Michael's summary of the Penguin translation of Laxdaela Saga.<p>
