RAINBOW Michael McKenny

Chapter 16 Tricked

We entered and sat around that rainbow hued table. I took my usual
place for the first time in the ordinary green wooden chair behind
the green coloured portion of that table.

I became aware that the other six were all looking at me. Violet
flashed me a smile which hardly calmed me down.

Indigo raised a hand. She looked so aged, yet she spoke in a very
melodious voice and her mellifluous words were supported by flawless
telepathy demonstrating her complete sincerity. "As we are all
aware, the normal rotation places me as chair of this gathering. The
first official duty is the very pleasant one of welcoming the newest
Wizard of Green. Greetings, Green, from me and on behalf of each of
the other colours. May Ay-yar ever guide you."

I bowed and replied in kind. "I never imagined that I would find
myself here, and I'm sure you can read from my mind that I have my
doubts about my ability to do a decent job."

"Very good," projected Indigo and I could feel the others agreeing
with her. "Your lack of confidence argues well for your being just
the person we need. So often those who start off so positive they
can do a job will fail."

"And don't worry," projected Orange. "As long as you allow Ay-yar to
guide you, he'll see you through the greatest obstacles."

"Now," projected Indigo, we have to consider all that's transpired
on Earth. Let's weave together our thoughts. Let's ponder fully the
significance of all that has happened there from the beginning of
that fascinating dream to the final breath of the previous Wizard of
Green. Are we agreed this is what we should be considering and how
we ought to proceed?"

"I agree," I projected and realized that I was not alone. We did
agree, all of us, and the information came from my ring that this
was more usual than not, when the seven of us met in council.

What came next was quite amazing, a bit like what I'd experienced on
my becoming the Wizard of Green. As vividly as if I were there, I
saw a host of flickering images. Most of these were memories of the
former Wizard of Green. Some, however, came from Orange and Blue. It
was a very strange sensation to see their perception of me. I had
the feeling that they were deliberately shielding their thoughts
here, allowing me just to see through the camera of their eyes, but
not to read what they were thinking about me at that time. This
undoubtedly was to spare my feelings. Blue did not hold back,
though, on the extent of her sorrow at the death of my predecessor.

Next, there came a rapid flood of analysis. Arising to my conscious
awareness came my friend Green's appraisal of my abilities to
continue his work and his suspicions as to what we ought to expect
next. To a great extent, all the personalities of the ring, all its
previous wearers, agreed with him. I could feel them as a kind of
haze sweeping up in layers to offer their joint perceptions and
recommendations. Even as they, almost instantaneously, as far as any
clock was concerned, were coming to a decision as to the most likely
course of action on the part of our foes, I realized the same had
been transpiring with each of the other six wizards here. Each of
those who had worn a wizard's ring in the long history of the planet
had pondered and we had a general concensus.

We considered it very likely that the lord of that other dimension,
whether or not he was the same most baleful entity who figured in
our history, was aware of our customs and traditions. This meant he
could well know about the day long ritual on the passing of a wizard
and be poised to take advantage of it. What might the forces of
chaos and darkness be up to in our absence?

"We must not allow Chaos to get away with this," projected Yellow.

"Agreed," projected Red.

"We will not allow them the free hand they expect," projected
Indigo, "although it will not be easy. We have, as I believe, all of
you have come to see, one most likely course of action. We will
return the three who have already been on Earth to that planet and
not only to the same place but to almost the same time they were
when they left to come here. Violet and Red, I believe this is the
sort of spell with which you two are most familiar. Do you wish to
comment?"

"I believe the fourth temporal variant of my sixth predecessor
combined with the normal teleportation spell will suffice," Violet
projected.

"Quite," projected Red and he included a visual of a bright red
smile on an old wooden tower on a grassy hill. "Though, of course,"
he added, "I would have gone with the seventh variant of the Ninth
Wizard of Red's time spells."

"This will require considerable energy," projected Indigo. "Our two
experts, however, feel it is possible. Are we agreed to proceed?"

"I agree," projected Yellow. "Green must not be allowed to die in
vain. More important, the billions of people now alive on Earth and
their descendants must be spared the consequences of Kaylooree's
impermissable ambition."

"I agree, too," projected Blue, "even if it isn't Kaylooree."

Into my head popped the image of Indigo looking at me. I projected
back a nod. The same happened with each of the others.

"Since we are agreed," Indigo projected, "let's work on building the
energy necessary for the temporal aspect of the spell."

I felt Violet's mind reach into her ring of power and draw out the
full details of the magical formulae being called upon. I could
sense that Red was reading the spell with almost complete
comprehension and was offering his expert assistance. I joined the
others in simply providing a bit of my life force as energy.

So, even though this was by no means an easy spell to develop, we
did it. All seven minds united in providing the energy to thrust
Orange, Blue and myself through the space time continuum to that
last point on Earth we three had occupied. Well, there was a
difference. We were visualizing an arrival six full minutes later
than our departure, in order to avoid the problems connected with
existing twice in the same place at the same time.

How clearly in my mind's eye appeared the living room of the former
Wizard of Green. I saw with remarkable clarity the balcony doors,
carpet, the book case, the table and chairs. Everything was so vivid
and distinct. In the back of my mind, I was aware that I was still
sitting on my green chair in the Tower of the Wizards. Then, I heard
the thoughts of the four who were to stay behind.

"Ay-yar guide you," projected Violet, and I viewed the visual
similar to some versions of the tarot Ace of Wands. A great hand was
reaching out from a cloud. The hand was clutching a large staff from
which sprang green leaves.

"Fascinating," projected Indigo, when she saw how that benediction
had been interpreted by my mind.

"Be careful," projected Red.

"All you have to do," projected Yellow, "is say the word and the
next minute will find replenishing energy, even an extra helper, at
your sides."

Orange replied to her with a visual of a branch blowing in a breeze.
"Your arrival will then be most welcome."

"And, Green, don't forget," projected Violet, "that you're supposed
to live at least a thousand years." I felt her mental smile, as warm
as any of those I'd known from Blue.

"I'll try to remember that," I replied.

Then in the flicker of an eye, the vivid image in my mind became
reality. Orange, Blue and I had left the seven hued table and the
Tower and planet of the Wizards behind and were again in the
apartment of the former Wizard of Green.

"We are exactly on time," projected Orange, as he gazed at the
clock on the wall. It matched precisely the six minute safety
margine we had given ourselves.

"Good," projected Blue. "Now, I wonder, whether we'll be allowed a
quiet night to catch up on some badly needed sleep."

"Possible," projected Orange, "but not very likely. Otherwise we'd
have stayed home."

"The good news," projected Blue, "is that we're not already picking
up any major disturbance."

"Six minutes," I projected, "you sure don't trust them." There was a
touch of humour in my remark and I could feel them smiling along
with me. In reality, we had been bantering just a bit, even as we
readied ourself for whatever emergency we likely would soon be
called upon to handle. We did not really need to sleep. The trip to
our home world had been more energizing than otherwise, thousands of
kilometres of travel across our planet notwithstanding. Due to our
concern about what lay ahead of us, we took our turns going into
trance and ensuring we were at maximum capacity.

When that was done, we sat in the chairs around the simple table in
the living room. There was a television here, and a radio in the
kitchen. However, we were not at all confident either would provide
us the news we needed faster than we could do so ourselves. Our
minds were on maximum alert. Any use of magic anywhere on the planet
by someone from offworld would most likely be instantly detected by
us.

We could feel the natural flow of occult influences by the
relatively large number of people here interested in such things.
Most were harmless, whatever the purpose and intent of the
occultists. A few were malefic, but not in the world threatening way
demanding our intervention. "Just maybe," I thought, "we were wrong
and nothing's going to happen."

"Do you play chess?" asked Orange. Along with that mental query,
flowed the vast amount of information about the wizards' great
enthusiasm for the game and even the move by move memory of all the
games which Orange had played in the past.

"Not seriously," I replied. "However, if you don't mind a quick
victory, I don't mind whiling away the time with a game."

We set up a board in our minds and I found that my command of the
game was remarkably improved, thanks to my transformation into the
Wizard of Green. I could visualize a great number of possible moves,
in a complex pattern stretching off almost to infinity. Of course,
over this portion of my mind I dropped a curtain, as did he over the
corresponding portion of his mind, so that our analyses of the game
and plans for its unfoldment were not picked up by casual telepathy.

"I have something interesting," projected Blue, breaking into the
game. Orange and I instantly dropped it, and our minds became
receptive to our colleague's mental transmission. 

This was of a village in India. The sun was already high in the
sky. We could see the people staring up at that sky and the
expressions of terror on their faces. We could perceive that which
had so alarmed them. There seemed to be cracks in the sky there,
cracks which were expanding. It was as though the sky was a window
instead of air, and that someone had tossed a rock through that
window.

"Something funny about the feel of this," came Blue's thought, and I
could feel Orange agreeing with her. What they meant was that our
perception of reality was being fooled with. If so, I was not able
to tell. It seemed to me that what Blue was projecting of the
unnatural occurrences in the Indian village was completely factual.
Yet, as the swift perception of the other two wizards reached me, I
understood that this was all a ploy to lure us away from Ottawa. It
was an image Blue had been allowed to receive. It did not come from
the subcontinent, but from a place much further away, though closer
than one could wish, at a time like this.

"I suspect we've got a very short time," projected Blue.

"The squirrel hole?" I suggested.

"More likely the spot where the black fly vanished," projected
Orange, "but we'll have to wait and see."

Another image popped into our minds. Then, we gave a start for the
TV came on by itself, with a newscaster reporting on what we were
seeing with our minds' eyes. There was a vision of a bay with ships
and the sun glinting of the water. Then the view moved up. In the
sky above was raging an unequal battle between air force planes and
a squadron of these pterodactyls.

"This is Mike Murphy bringing you up to date on the bizarre
appearance in the skies above Wellington Harbour, New Zealand of
what appear to be prehistoric pterodactyls. Some people are calling
them dragons. Whatever they're called, they appear hostile. Already,
several planes have been knocked from the sky."

Suddenly the announcer and the picture of New Zealand vanished from
the screen, to be replaced by another person, who was standing in
front of a large map of the planet. With a start I realized that
Orange was comparing unfavourably the Terran map, a Mercator
projection, with the normal three dimensional global representations
used back home and I realised he was right. Anyway, there were about
ten red pins on the map. The new announcer was pointing at them.

"Other reports are being received from widely scattered spots. From
Buenos Aires to Lagos, from Madrid to Stockholm, from Washington to
Peking, the creatures from another era are appearing in the skies,
terrifying the population, and, with almost contemptuous ease,
making short shrift of any aircraft sent aloft to confront them. The
only things the locations of these bizarre scenes seem to have in
common is that they are national capitals, with the exception of a
military base in the American midwest, whose precise whereabouts we
are unable to specify at this time."

He looked worried, as though he knew something awesome he was not
allowed to report. We could read from his mind that the Americans
had in desperation fired nuclear weapons at these apparently
invincible foes. They had caused a significant amount of damage to
their own base, but the flying terrors had not been adversely
affected.

"Should we really be able to read the mind of some guy on TV?" I
asked.

"It's all a hoax," replied Blue.

"Quite an elaborate hoax," I projected. Truthfully, I was more than
half convinced that what we were seeing was real, and they were
tricking us to remain out of the way. I shared that thought with the
other two.

"No," projected Orange. "We'll know when the action begins for
real."

"There!" projected Blue.

Even as the image of Big Ben came into our minds, with a dozen
black flies emerging from a tiny black hole a kilometre above it, we
were there. All the surroundings looked exactly as that mental image
had looked. The only difference was that there were no
ultradimensional black flies here.

"Amazing!" projected Orange.

"They fooled us anyway!" Blue projected in utter astonishment.

Instantly, we were back in Ottawa, though not in the apartment which
had been our waiting room. Instead, we hovered in the sky very close
to the place where the one pterodactyl to actually confront us had
vanished.

"I don't understand," I projected. "They succeeded in luring us
away, and didn't take advantage of that."

And then the horrific truth dawned on us. They had outplayed us in
several different ways. They had kept our minds focused on the sky,
so that we would be less likely to note what was going on under the
ground. They had offered us visions of the depradations of
pterodactyls, in order to blur our reception of the transportation
here of insectoids and slithering things dimly related to worms and
snakes. They had focused our attention on Ottawa, by quite cleverly
mentioning other national capitals, so that they could strike at
other places undetected.

With the speed of lightning, Orange and Blue detected several rural
areas, from the Okanagan Valley in the far west of Canada to the
northwest of the state of Maryland, from the backlands of Brazil to
the steppes of Russia, where things like grubs and worms had entered
this dimension unnoticed by us.

"This is quite extensive, both in geographical distribution and in
the very high number of interdimensional entities involved," Blue
projected. "I think it's time to let them know back home."

"Agreed," I projected.

Orange was already dropping into the deep state of concentration
required for the interstellar message. I saw in his mind his instant
link with Yellow. She and the others were still seated at the
rainbow table. I watched Yellow's concerned greeting and the rapid
dispatch of information, instantly flowing from Yellow's mind to the
minds of the other three colours. I saw the reflection within Orange
of Yellow's awareness of the stirring of Indigo and the others. She,
too, shared our sense of bewilderment and humility that we could
have been so fooled and that the situation could be so serious.

Indigo's serene and serious visage appeared in this mental image
from Yellow reflected in Orange's mind. As calmly as one suggesting
the items for an ordinary meal, she projected, "I think we need to
send more than energy. We cannot all go, as we have to guarantee our
planet is safeguarded. I suggest Red and I remain here and that
Yellow and Violet participate in the task on Earth."

Red, Yellow and Violet immediately agreed.

"Estimated time of arrival," projected Yellow, "one sixth of a
second."

"Welcome will you be," projected Orange.

We braced ourselves for their arrival and the quick teleport to
one of the spots infested by grubs and the like.

Then I felt a faint transmission from Violet.

"We're not getting through," she projected.

"Orange," I began, and halted, aware he was in touch, faintly, with
Yellow. I could feel his surprise at the magnitude of the
interference there was. I could feel Indigo and Red beaming some of
their life force to the two trying to reach us. I could feel the
intense determination being exerted by Violet and Yellow.

"Come on, Green and Blue," projected Orange. "Let's do our part."

Blue and I fed him energy as he reached out towards the arriving
two. Within his mind grew the image of a great bridge. I watched it
strengthening, becoming more substantial, acquiring increasing
solidity. Orange's bridge encountered the barrier, was briefly
resisted and then pushed through it, so that obstacle seemed as
insubstantial as mist.

"'I'd bridge the azure sea to call on you,'" came Yellow's emotional
thought, as she and Violet broke through and made it to Earth.

"Glad you could make it," projected Orange with some considerable
understatement.

"Now," projected Violet, after a quick visual of her holding a
ceremonial cup in my direction, "let's do what we came to do."

At once the five of us drew together. This was not the full unity
of the seven hued rainbow in complete magical integration. Still,
there was an awesome sense of potency and strength. We sent out a
thought probe. It sped around the planet at the speed of light. We
detected the places, where the grubs were currently strongest.

"Indigo figured," projected Yellow, "that the great dance would
provide an excellent paradigm." To me she sent a visual of the
intricate pattern of this popular dance, amplified by the wizards in
very swift visits to various dance halls across the planet. Very
precise was the timing of the succession of halls through which the
dance was danced by wizards arriving to occupy their space in the
halls otherwise replete with dancers.

"I would be delighted," replied Orange.

"And I," I projected to Violet, "though I have not done this
before."

"I'm sure you'll do fine," she replied.

"Let's do it," projected Blue.

And with remarkable swiftness we began our circuit of Earth.
Along the same path our minds had determined, our bodies, and more
importantly our will power and protective spells, followed. It was
truly as though we were dancers with the globe as our stage. First,
we arrived at the spot of greatest infestation in Western Canada.
More than a million darkly shimmering, wriggling, shadow worms or
whatever had arrived there and were seeking to spread out throughout
the whole region.

"Ay-yar ih Ay-yar nih!" Blue projected and her psychic shout
resounded through my mind. The potent light rune was repeated, this
time by all five of us.

I could sense those one million denizens of the Pit yearning to
return home. All five of us could trace that thought backwards and
clearly see the route they had taken to arrive here. There was one
and only one functioning passage between the dimensions. All of the
grubs, worms and whatever had come through one spot and then
teleported or been teleported across the planet.

That one passageway was the same through which the black fly had
left Earth. It was, however, not in the city of Ottawa. The high
minister of the chief demon had moved it, not only to this time, but
also in space. In my mind's eye flashed the image of collapsed
timber and loose stone rubble on an uneven stone floor underground.
The portal was in an old abandoned mine in Nova Scotia.
   We drove them back, all million and more of them, through the
more than three thousand miles that separate British Columbia from
the abandoned mind on the Atlantic coast. We felt their tremendous
confusion as they arrived tumbling into additional ultradimensional
entities racing through the passage from their home world.

Then, we struck. As swift and brilliant as lightning sped the
lightrays from our rings of power. Sensing the fact that these
creatures would not be bothered by the normal radiance of Terran
lightning, we subtly adapted the illumination of our rays to their
visual receptors. There came a shriek and the whole mass of them,
the ones which we had transported from BC and the ones just emerging
from the passage into this dimension, turned and fled back to their
own abode.

As this was transpiring, with microsecond rapidity, the five of us
continued to circle the world, to dance our dance, instantly
appearing in spot after spot suffering from this infestation of
pseudoinsects from another dimension. With that same microsecond
swift speed we rounded them up and expelled them from this space
time continuum. It had been so precise, so sure and so complete, but
it had also been quite energy draining.

"I knew you would do well," projected Violet.

"It was the company," I replied.

"It was also very exhausting," projected Orange.

"Yes," projected Yellow, "we could all do with a bit of rest".
