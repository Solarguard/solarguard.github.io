HISTORY OF THE FORMER HAN DYNASTY vol 3, Pan Ku, transl. Homer H.
Dubs, Waverly Press, Baltimore 1955

This third volume of the Dubs edition of Pan Ku's impressive history
focuses on the great interloper, Wang Mang. It begins with the
reigns of Hsiao-ai and Hsiao-p'ing.

Pages 1-14 are Dubs' introduction to Ku's Chapter Eleven. Mentioned
are Emperor Ai's attempt to rule, the influence on him from the
Wang, Chao, Fu and Ting clans, the revelation book Kan Chung-k'o
attributed to the Red Lord spirit, the rank and wealth given to Tung
Hsien who fell immediately on Emperor Ai's death, continued
Confucian influence and changes to official titles.

Chapter Eleven (pp. 15-39) begins with the youthful learning of Liu
Hsin (Ai), his appointment as heir and his succession on Emperor
Ch'eng's death. Ai on Confucian principle abolished the Bureau of
Music, strove for humane and unoppressive government, attended
celestial and other signs and sought the recommendation of capable
people. At this time (3 B.C.E.) there was a procession of the
Western Mother Goddess and a visit (1 B.C.E.) from the Shan-yu of
the Huns. Ai died on August 15, 1 B.C.E.

Appendices (pp. 40-43) to the chapter concern the period of mourning
and eclipses.

Pages 44-60 are Dubs' introduction to Ku's Chapter Twelve. Dubs
mentions Wang Mang's administration during the entire reign
(1 B.C.E.-6 C.E.) of P'ing who died before attaining his majority,
Wang's revenge against Ai's maternal relatives, his preventing
P'ing's maternal relatives (Wei) access to the court, Wang Mang's
execution of his own son and the Wei clan, his elimination of rivals
and his obtaining popular support, the marriage of his daughter to
the emperor, Wang Mang's support of the Confucian scholar Liu Hsin
and of such texts as the Tso-chuan. Dubs considers the accusation of
regicide against Wang Mang propaganda contradicted by the deep
Confucianism of the great minister.

Chapter Twelve (pp. 61-86) begins with the succession of the young
Emperor P'ing, the demotion and dismissal of Ai's maternal
relatives, amnesty and the prohibition against presenting charges
for offences predating the amnesty. Ethical measures (such as
repaying excessive taxes) are mentioned. Appointments are recorded.
In 2 C.E. locusts and drought afflicted Ch'ing province. Taxes were
lightened, payment made for caught locusts, funeral expenses
defrayed. In 3 C.E. Wang Mang's daughter married the Emperor.
Education was promoted. The Wei clan and Wang Mang's son were
executed.

An edict prohibited imprisonment of women, the very young and the
very old for offences by family members, except very severe offences
or if such people were specifically named in imperial warrants.
Several thousand scholars were invited and came to the capital.
Emperor P'ing died on February 3, 6 C.E.

Page 87 is an appendix on eclipses in P'ing's reign.

Pages 88-124 are Dubs' introduction to Chapter Ninety Nine, the
biography of Wang Mang. There is the form of such biographies, with,
for example, mention of ancestry in the first clan biography, as
Wang Mang's is found in Chapter Ninety Eight, the biography of the
Grand Empress Dowager. There are Pan Ku's sources:

   In this chapter, the amount of direct and extended quotation from
   primary sources is noteworthy. In Part A, these explicit
   quotations form 68% of the whole; in Part B, 53%; and in Part C,
   41% (exclusive of the eulogy); an average of 55% for the chapter.
   p. 91

The extent of archival material is noted, as is Pan Ku's use of such
sources. Dubs attributes the detailed account of Wang Mang's death
to Wang's intimate Ts'ui Fa and perhaps Kung-pin Chiu. Dubs states
reasons for Pan Ku to have been unsympathetic to Wang Mang and
remarks on Pan Ku's focus on historical accuracy. Dubs is impressed
by the literary quality of the biography, though he speaks of this
largely in terms of the impression the reader obtains of Wang Mang.

Wang Mang's Confucian use of magic is presented, including titles
designed to be magically effective. The impact of Five Elements
thought and portents on Wang Mang's accession are explained. The
effect of drought, canal failure, flooding and changed Yellow River
course (11 C.E.), Wang Mang's conscientious indecisiveness and
unwillingness to delegate decision making, his large increase in the
bureaucracy, introduction of insecurity into official's income,
Wang's undiplomatic treatment of neighbouring rulers, his imperial
extravagance, including ill-considered massive military deployments
to areas unable to provision so many men, his despotic alienation of
all, including his own clan, are adduced as reasons for his fall.

Chapter 99A (pp. 125-259) begins with Wang Mang's studious, filial
and charitable younger years. Then comes his appointment to the
palace and his advancement, becoming commander-in-chief in his
thirty-eighth year (8 B.C.E.). On the death of Emperor Ch'eng, the
Empress Dowager ordered Wang Mang to retire. Emperor Ai did not
accept the proffered resignation. Later it was accepted. The
emperor received recommendations for Wang Mang. Wang Mang was
invited to return.

On the death of Emperor Ai, P'ing, a boy, succeeded. The Empress
Dowager entrusted the government to Wang Mang. Wang Mang advanced
his supporters and removed others. Wang Mang refused awards and such
were bestowed on some of his supporters. Pan Ku editorially remarks
on Wang Mang's motive for following Confucian humility and, for
example, requesting his daughter be excluded from Emperor P'ing's
marriage selection, this causing a strong popular sentiment that she
become the empress. She does. Wang Mang extends bestowals to the
families of the eleven concubines chosen with her and to his poorer
relations.

The marriage has favourable divination by yarrow stalk and by
tortoise shell. Chang Shun's praise of Wang Mang is quoted on pages
162-179 with Chang's request that Wang Mang receive his deserved
reward. Mentioned is the enforced remoteness of the Wei clan from
the emperor, the scheme to confront Wang Mang with feigned
supernatural power, Wang Mang's imprisonment of his own son, who
committed suicide in prison. Wang's upright life is praised. His
support of scholars is recorded. He was concerned to re-establish
traditional rites and fix ritual music. There is Wang Mang's Charter
(pp. 204-208) with such praise as:

   You have restored what had been abolished for a thousand years
   and straightened out the mistakes of a hundred generations.
   p. 206

Wang Mang was granted marks of distinction. Neighbouring peoples
submitted to Chinese rule. Wang Mang sought to settle the West,
arousing the initial opposition from the common people to his
administration. On the death of Emperor P'ing, Wang Mang advised no
adult cousin succeed, but two year old Liu Ying. Portents arrived
proclaiming that Wang Mang become emperor. He was named regent. Liu
Ch'ung rebelled and was defeated. The Western Ch'iang rebelled and
were defeated. Chai Yi rebelled and was annihalated. Wang Mang
rectified titles.

Wang Mang's mother died. As regent, he did not wear mourning. He
became acting emperor. Chang Ch'ung and fellow plotters were
discovered and executed. On January 10, 9 C.E. Wang accepted the
Mandate of Heaven and inaugurated the Hsin Dynasty.

Part B (pp. 260-366) begins with Wang Mang's issuing of a new seal
to the Grand Empress Dowager and his appointment of his son Wang Lin
as heir. Rectification of titular designations is presented. Wang
Mang's attention to the great ancestors back into very early times
is evidenced. He sought to promote coinage and amulets more
magically resonant with the new dynasty.

Liu K'uai rebelled in 9 C.E. and was defeated.

Wang Mang attempted land reforms, economic changes, the reduction of
slavery in an effort to restore traditional humane government.
Portents are mentioned. There were internal difficulties caused by
the changes and neighbouring rulers rebelled over diminished titles
on the new seals given to them. Liu Tu's attempt to lead an uprising
was cut short. There was disaffection among some of Wang Mang's
officials. Wang ruled despotically through fear, punishments and
executions.

There was brigandage, hardship afflicted by imperial troops, decrees
against corruption, a flooding Yellow River, locusts and extension
of noble ranks with their increased drain on imperial revenues.
T'ien T'an, governor of Liao-hsi, was killed fighting those who had
fled to avoid attacking northern barbarians. The rebellion was
crushed. Wang Mang focused on restoring traditional ways. The
Empress Dowager died. Wang Mang mourned her for three years.

Wang Mang's thought of moving to Lo-yang caused some disregard for
the upkeep of Ch'ang-an. Wang Mang was dissuaded from a grand tour
of the empire, but he ordered plans for building the imperial
structures at Lo-yang. There was trouble on the southwestern
frontier. There was hunger on the border, reports of a dead yellow
dragon, large bodies of troops causing hunger in Wu-yuan and Ta,
brigandage, extreme weather, reduction in the dishes at the imperial
table, heavy losses of troops to disease and an ambush of troops at
Karshahr.

Part C (pp. 367-474) begins with Wang Mang's enfoefment of many
nobles and his failure to provide them with their specified
salaries. He taxed slaves. Mother Lu raised a robber band and killed
the administrator who had executed her son. Fei Hsing who sought to
assist robbers to return to farming was dismissed. Wang Tsung,
imperial grandson, was executed for his ambitious paintings and
seals. Some of his relatives also fell.

In 18 C.E. Red Eyebrows bandits led by Li Tzu-tu, Fan Ch'ung, etc.
emerged. Significant military exertions, and consequent expense,
were required against these and against the Huns. A manned flight of
"several hundred double-paces" (p. 382) is recorded in 19 C.E.
Chuang Yu, who advised against Wang Mang's aggressive militarism,
was dismissed. Increased taxation added to distress. Executions were
not restricted, as traditionally, to winter. Ominous prodigies there
were. Wang Mang announced Wang An as heir and began work on his
ancestral temples, material for these coming from demolished
palaces, etc. Great was this projects expense, in funds and in human
lives.

In 20 C.E. Ma-shih Ch'iu's plot was uncovered and many executed. The
new Grand Tutor, T'ang Tsun, displayed visible personal frugality.
Wang Mang's wife died in 21 C.E. That year also died Wang Lin, Wang
An and Wang Mang's grandson Wang Shou. Wang K'uang wrote a
revelation book of a hundred thousand words concerning the demise of
Wang Mang and his dynasty. Li Yen, leader of this plot, and others
were all killed.

Wang Mang is said to have been disturbed by dreams and by fears of
supernatural influences in Kao's temple. Those speaking frankly did
not please Wang Mang. Locusts came to the capital. There was hunger.
Relief efforts at Ch'ang-an were frustrated by the rapacity of
officials. Wang K'uang's rash advance led to a Red Eyebrow victory
over an imperial army. Uprisings continued. Liu Hsiu, future Han
restorer Kwang-wu, stormed Chi-yang.

Liu Hsuan was proclaimed emperor. Wang Mang proceeded with his
marriage to a Shih woman. Wang Mang enjoyed time in his harem and
pursued magical studies. Liu Hsiu won victories in Ying-ch'uan. Wang
Mang despatched the most impressive military force in history. This
was defeated. Palace Guards Commander Wang She, Liu Hsin and
Commander-in-Chief Tung Chun plotted, were found out and died. Liu
Hsin's ghost was seen. Wang Mang made Wang Yi his heir.

   (Wang) Mang was so distressed and worried that he could not eat.
   He only drank wine, ate shellfish, and read books on military
   matters. When he was tired, he would rest (his head) upon his
   stool and sleep without again seeking his pillow. p. 454

Wang Mang sought to reduce by magical means Han influence. There was
rebellion in T'ien-shui and An-ting commanderies. Wu pass was
surrendered. Wang Mang appealed to Heaven and sent out nine tiger
generals. These were promptly defeated. Six fled. Three fell back to
the Capital Granery. The Han forces swept through the country,
defiled the Hsin tombs and forced their way into Ch'ang-an.

Wang Mang sought magical protection. He went to the Tower Bathed by
Water. His defenders spent arrows and crossbow bolts and then drew
swords and fell fighting. Tu Wu slew Wang Mang. Kung-pin Chiu
beheaded him. Other soldiers hacked his body to pieces. Wang Hsien
had kept the seals and lived as emperor for a couple of days. He was
executed as new forces entered the city. The fate of some of Wang
Mang's underlings is mentioned.

Several months later, in March 24 C.E., Liu Hsuan arrived in
Ch'ang-an and issued an amnesty. In the summer of 25 C.E. Fan Ch'ung
led a large force of Red Eyebrows into Ch'ang-an, killed Liu Hsuan
and burned the capital. In August 25 C.E. Emperor Kwang-wu ascended
the throne in Lo-yang.

Pan Ku closes the chapter by assessing Wang Mang to be calculating
in his filial acts, humble deeds and diligent service. Pan judges
Wang Mang deceitful, hypocritical, scornful towards heaven, the
cause of great suffering for the people of the empire.

Michael McKenny considers Wang Mang a human being poorly acquainted
with economic realities, over-extending the state he governed
through excessive expenditures on unnecessary military ventures, on
an increased nobility and on massive imperial building projects.

The remainder of this volume, including the examination of Wang
Mang's economic policies and the kang-mao amulets, is considered
separately.
