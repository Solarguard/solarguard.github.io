Greetings.

I am very grateful for this opportunity to extend the following gift
To the President and the People of the United States of America.

As the President was visiting here in our National Capital, a number
of us conducted a ritual for security and peace at the Canadian War
Memorial. As is customary in our rituals, we not only called upon
the spiritual assistance of our ancestors, revered ones and highly
honored beings, we listened to them. This awe inspiring reply we now
present:

The past has been a very wild and tumultuous time. We stand now at a
moment in history when our greatest concern, our most fundamental
consideration, our essention aspiration are for our home, our
dwelling place, our homeland.

We approach the future aware that inner strengths, resolves and
resources are available to guide us through the challenges often
exacerbated by unconscious inclinations and prejudices.

The time in which we live is a very great gift. We stand fully able
to choose on the crossroads between the past and the future,
misunderstanding and comprehension, tribalism and humanity.

The offering presented to us by our ancestors, by spiritual, by very
respected entities is the realization that now our security depends
upon perceiving the truth that our homeland embraces the planet. In
the terminology employed by one American TV program, the issue is
the homeworld of the human species.

There cannot be any safety for a part of the planet in the illusary
calculations of national or even continental missile systems. If a
human being, if a leader, if a government honestly seeks the safety,
protection and well-being of their population, now is the time to
look deeply, respond responsibly to selfish and to prejudicial
temptations and choose what advances, not the interests of some, but
all of humanity.

Yes, today finds many elements of discord and conflict. Still, the
past, both distant and near, clearly confirms the incapacity of
weapons to guarantee the continued security of any segment of the
human species. Rather, now the opportunity exists to proceed beyond
what fails in its stated purpose to the one sure means of securing
the protection, prosperity and well-being of our entire homeland,
our dwelling place, our homeworld.

We have prayed, we pray and we will pray that the ancestors, the
sacred ones, the spiritual beings effectively communicate to you, as
to each people, leader, government on Earth, that you are first,
fundamentally and essentially human. May your policies be informed
of this reality, empowering, not those succumbing to temptations of
avarice and prejudice, but all the residents of the planet. May you
work with the United Nations, striving to improve it where you deem
it imperfect, realizing that this is the day for each portion of the
world to understand its best interest depends upon the well-being of
the whole of humanity. Not the assertion of the power of a part of
the species, but the real consensus of the species can achieve what
is now the concern of all, how to live harmoniously upon our common
homeworld.

I append the specific runic divination which was addressed to you in
the above words. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask.

May the blessings of those who have trodden the path of life ahead
of us, of all those sharing this planet with you and of all highly
honoured spiritual essences be yours, Michael McKenny.

Appended Divination from November 30, 2004 ritual at the Canadian
War Memorial:

Past: Uruz. The Past was a wild and energetic time.

Present: Othila. What we are being informed of concerning the
present is the importance of the home, the abiding place, the
homeland, the human homeworld shared with the other species on this
planet.

Future: Laguz. Our attention for the future is directed to the
inner, our inner resources. We are to become conscious of the
unconscious, of that which is below the surface.

In response to our traditional question, "Our gods have spoken. Are
we satisfied or would we hear more?" the request was made that we
hear more. The following explanatory rune was drawn:

Explanatory: Gebo. The future is a gift. Also, a strong impression
now is the aspect of this rune that is the crossroads. We stand at
the crossroads of the past and the present, of peace and of war, of
previous unintelligent behaviour and rational, intuitive, spiritual
life upon our homeworld.
