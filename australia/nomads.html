TRIUMPH OF THE NOMADS, Geoffrey Blainey, Sun Books, Melbourne, 1978
(1975)

The book begins with a preface (pp. v-viii) mentioning the scale of
the achievement of the only humans to cross the sea to an
uninhabited continent, explore and dwell across that continent and
when discovered a few hundred years ago be living a life more
nutritious, enjoyable and prosperous than Europeans of that time.
Aboriginals also had a great cultural diversity.

Chapter One, "Fire on the Lake" (pp. 3-14), introduces the discovery
of a partially cremated body at Lake Mungo from more than 25,000
years ago, a time when the climate was moister and cooler. The lower
sea level is mentioned and the consequent existence then of much
land now beneath the sea. There were volcanoes, though not many. The
previously held opinion that Aboriginals had a static existence
within a static environment is now challenged by knowledge of such
ancient volcanoes, but especially by awareness of the rising level
of the sea.

Chapter Two, "The Discoverers" (pp. 15-31), begins with Wallace's
Line separating Australian marsupials from Asian predators. Possible
routes for human migration are mentioned, including from Timor.

   Professor John Mulvaney, in his excellent book The Prehistory of
   Australia, thought the ocean between Timor and Australia was too
   wide an obstacle. Instead he suggested the possibility of the
   first migrants reaching the continent somewhere near the western
   shore of New Guinea or near the mountains which are now the Aru
   Islands. He briefly charted a possible route--predominantly
   overland--from South China and Taiwan through the Philippines and
   Borneo and the Celebes. p. 17

There is reference to accidental voyagers and possible reasons
(famine, banishment, military defeat) for deliberate emigration. The
newcomers likely had many familiar things to eat, along with
novelties. Some vegetation, such as tamarind trees, could be more
recent introductions to Australia. Archaeological remains confirm
habitation in the southwest and southeast thirty thousand and more
years ago; the duration and nature of the migration there from the
north is unclear.

The situation c. 1800, some five to ten thousand "small bands of
wanderers" p. 28 consisting of some twenty to fifty people composed
of three or four families.

   According to cautious counts the continent eventually had more
   than 300 languages, and the number would be much larger if sharp
   differences of dialect were included. p. 31

Chapter Three, "The Tasmanians: Outline of a Puzzle" (pp. 32-48)
discusses the perplexity of Nineteenth Century Europeans on
encountering the dark skinned, woolly haired Tasmanians who lacked
boomerang and spear-thrower. Unconscious until 1895 that Tasmania
once was part of the continent, unaware of the true length of time
involved, assuming unchanging physique, language and customs,
authors sought and found links between Tasmanians and Africans, or
Andaman Islanders, or New Caladonians. Australian Aboriginals were
thought to come from South India.

Chapter Four, "Death of the Giants" (pp. 51-66), introduces
diprodoton, giant kangaroo, marsupial lion, etc. and the possibility
humans may have contributed to their extinction. Other species
elsewhere (dodo, moa, North American camels, ground sloths and
mammoths) may have fallen to man. There is the possible role of the
dingo (likely arriving with humans after Aboriginals were already on
the continent) in the extinction, save in Tasmania, of the marsupial
lion and thylacine. There is the Tasmanian Devil which existed in
Arnhem Land three thousand years ago. Seven thousand years ago:

   An aboriginal near Lake Nitchie (N.S.W.) was ceremonially buried,
   and on his neck hung one of the most impressive necklaces so far
   found in Australia--a string of 178 pierced teeth from Tasmanian
   Devils. Such a necklace suggests that about 7,000 years ago the
   animal was abundant; on the other hand the teeth might have been
   scarce by that time and therefore a rare treasure fit to be
   buried with a man of importance. p. 64

The author is cautious in attributing causes for the extinction of
species, stressing the absence of certain knowledge.

Chapter Five, "A Burning Continent" (pp. 67-83), looks at the use of
the fire-stick and of fire in general by the Aboriginals. They could
produce fire by rubbing sticks together, using wood dust or a bit of
dry kangaroo dung for kindling. Men produced fire; women transported
it.

   The variety of uses of fire possibly explains, more than any
   other reason, why aboriginals carried it everywhere as if it were
   their prized possession. Fire grilled or roasted their meat and
   fish; it cooked some of their vegetables. In many regions fire
   burned the dead and raised the ornamental scars on the living.
   Fire deterred the evil spirits from approaching a camp at night.
   A flaming stick, it was often believed, would curb the wind or
   halt the rain. Smoke was the most popular insect repellant, and
   in parts of Arnhem Land smoking fires were kept burning all night
   under a kind of stilt but known as a 'mosquito house' in order to
   protect sleepers from mosquitoes. Near Cape York the smoke of
   slow-burning fires served the same purpose in igloo-like huts.
   Flames were used to drive snakes from long grass where nomads
   hoped to camp that night; and in parts of the River Murray hot
   ashes were used as a poultice on human limbs bitten by snakes.

   Fire not only helped to manufacture spears and hafted axes; it
   was also used instead of an axe. If the camp lacked firewood,
   women would light a small fire near the base of a tree; and by
   carefully tending the fire they burned through the trunk until
   the tree toppled. pp. 71-72

Fire, of course, provided illumination at night, served as a beacon
and produced smoke signals. It also extracted or directed game and
controlled the vegetation. The author claims that also in America
use of fire kept the northeastern forests open for more deer and
permitted the grassy Great Plains. The plains in Australia attracted
the European sheep which allowed Australia to produce more wool than
any other land on Earth.

Chapter Six, "The Rising of the Seas" (pp. 84-91), begins with the
possibly reciprocal contact between the Indonesian Islands and the
greater continent of New Guinea and Australia, including Tasmania.
The suggestion is presented of the impact of water on ancestral
lands and of the gradually increasing difficulty of wading and
rafting between traditional territories. And the point is made that
many human sites await archaeological exploration underwater. The
timing is unclear, and the separation of New Guinea from Australia
has been placed at between 8,000 and 6,500 years ago.

There are glimpses of the consequences, of the disruption, the
changes caused by the rising water and the warmer climate.

Chapter Seven, "Birth and Death" (pp. 92-121), begins with the
estimate of some 250,000 Aboriginals on the appearance of Europeans
and the calculation that taking four static generations per century
would mean that three hundred million people inhabited Australia
from 28,000 B.C.E. until that appearance. Next is the serious
questioning of Malthius' assertion that Australians generally
experienced near starvation. There were methods of population
control, such as abortion, infanticide, nursing until three years
old. It is stated that one twin was killed. Care of the old is
mentioned and the acceptance of their death when they became unable
to travel.

Assumptions that nomads are less susceptible to disease are
questioned and some details are given of diseases after European
arrival. Questioned also is the concept of the relatively unwarlike
nomad. Cited is the story of William Buckley in the early Nineteenth
Century and the study by Lloyd Warner in the early Twentieth Century
calculating a higher death rate in fighting for Aboriginals than for
European nations, notwithstanding the European wars of the time.

Chapter Eight, "The Hunters" (pp. 125-154), begins with Europeans
impressed by Aboriginal weapons, especially the boomerang.

   Though boomerangs and a variety of straight short throwing-sticks
   were widely used, it is doubtful whether they were the main
   hunting weapon of any nomadic group. If we could compile
   statistics of all food eaten on the continent on the eve of the
   white invasion, it is improbable that as much as one per cent of
   food was gathered by the boomerangs and allied throwing sticks.
   It is likely that the pointed digging-stick carried by women
   provided more food in a day than boomerangs provided in an
   average month. p. 127

There is discussion of the spear, the spear-thrower (woomera),
waddy, club, axe and the unused bow and arrow. Aboriginal hunters
did use mimicry. There is a look at the variety of fish caught by a
variety of methods and there was taking and eating of turtles,
seals, beached whales and shellfish. Mounds of the shells reach up
to thirty feet high. There was fishing along the seacoast and along
the rivers. There were impressive fish traps and bark canoes. There
was hunting of birds and taking of eggs.

Chapter Nine, "Harvest of the Unploughed Plains" (pp. 155-170),
begins with European assumptions of heavy meat consumption and the
largely ignored report written by Edward Palmer.

   In 1883 he sent a paper to the Royal Society of New South Wales,
   vowing from his long experience with aboriginals in the Gulf
   country that 'nearly half of their daily food' consists of roots
   and fruits. He listed 106 plants which were used for food or
   medicine. He could have added another fifty, he said, if he had
   known how to classify them. p. 156

Later calculations are mentioned, as well as the significance of
fish in those areas near fish bearing waters. There is reference to
specifics, including the kernels of Bunya-Bunya pine cones eaten at
a great festival. The impact of Europeans, including introduction
of cattle and sheep is mentioned.

Chapter Ten, "Medicines and Drugs, Liquids and Cosmetics" (pp. 171
to 184), mentions the large number of medicinal plants, the absence
of alcohol, the presence of tobacco, poisoning of fish, use of
glues, finding of water and the use of cosmetics, especially ochre.

Chapter Eleven, "The Logic of Unending Travel" (pp. 185-202), begins
with movement occasioned by Aboriginal awareness of environmental
features and cycles. The quite varied year of the Wik Monkan people
of Cape York Peninsula is outlined with the observation that
archaeologists confronted with the remains of the Wik Monkan varying
camps could easily, and erroneously, ascribe them to separate
cultures. There is mention of a possibly greater capacity of
Aboriginals to consume some foods, to maintain body heat in cold
weather and to experience effective blood circulation. There is also
some evidence of food storage (fruit and vegetable, not meat, nor
fish), though generally steady rain could mean hunger for those who
gathered food every day and usually had no reserves. There is
reference to intricacies and complexities of food prohibitions.

Chapter Twelve, "Trade Routes and Rituals" (pp. 203-216), begins
with the distance impressive seashells, ochre, axes, spearheads and
even millstones travelled. There is the gift exchange in Arnhem Land
during ceremonial gatherings, such as initiations.

   In the great assemblies in the open air the goods appeared--the
   red and yellow ochres, the kaolin, the spears, boomerangs, stone
   axes and stone knives, dilly bags, the beeswax and resin which
   served as adhesives, the hair belts, the pubic coverings of
   pearl-shell and other decorative objects. p. 211

There is discussion of the extent to which such exchanges were
economic or social, or, indeed, to what extent such a distinction
has meaning. It is reiterated that while some items, such as
grinding stones, were very important, nomads lacking the wheel and
beasts of burden could only carry with them very little property.

Chapter Thirteen, "The Prosperous Nomads" (pp. 217-229), continues
this point that the absence of monumental buildings (often evidences
of economic differences and poverty within the societies that erect
them) and even of clothing, among a people ornately decorated with
body paint in a warm climate, are to be expected of nomads whose
well-being and prosperity are not defined by unnecessary objects.
The notion of the general near starvation of Aboriginals is rejected
and attributed in part to the deaths of white explorers lacking the
Aboriginals' environmental knowledge and skills.

The value of an oral tradition is stated.

Chapter Fourteen, "Sails of Doom" (pp. 230-254), looks at the
attainment in various parts of the world of agriculture, writing,
the wheel, the town, etc. Agriculture came to New Guinea and even to
some islands in the Torres Strait, but Australia remained nomadic,
hunter-gatherer. There was trade in artefacts, customs, ideas and
genes, but agriculture failed to penetrate Australia. Other voyagers
including possibly Chinese are mentioned. The role of Timor in sea
trade, especially sandalwood, and the great voyages of Ming Admiral
Cheng Ho are noted. A fuller description of Cheng Ho may be seen at:

WHEN CHINA RULED THE SEAS</A> a review of Louise Levathes' book
about this fascinating episode in the history of maritime
exploration.<p>

The arrival of Europeans in the Timor area and Indonesia is
recounted. Then there are the Macassarmen who came from Indonesia
for trepang and fished along a seven hundred mile stretch of coast
in the northwest. Finally, there came the English.

This is a sympathetic treatment of the subject by one writing in a
more popular or journalistic than in an academic style.
