<center>THE WORLD OF THE DRUIDS</center><p>

Miranda Green, Thames and Hudson, London & N.Y., 1997.<p>

This book begins by mentioning the three sources of knowledge about
the Druids and the Celts: Classical references, Celtic literature and
archaeological remains. It discusses the origin of the word druid and
its connection to the oak tree and/or wisdom. It states that Herodotus
uses the term Celt and that no Classical source refers to the residents
of Britain as Celts. Reference is made to the oral nature of Celtic
society and to the Hallstatt and La Tene archaeological cultures.<p>

The varied nature of the Classical references to druids is raised.
Writers in the First Century B.C.E. present them in a favourable light
as judges and teachers; First Century C.E. writers focus more on dark
and sinister sacrifices. It is noted that the Julio-Claudian emperors
moved against the druids, possibly on grounds of suppressing
nationalism, and that there are references to druidism in Gaul in the
Late Empire, as well as to the survival of druidism in Ireland after the
fall of the Empire in the West. And this book mentions, after the
triumph of Christianity, the revival of druidism in the meso-pagan
period.<p>

Citing Caesar's identification of Celtic deities with similar Roman
ones, Miranda Green writes that the Celts considered sky, including
thunder and water, sacred, that, "Every mountain, river, spring, marsh,
tree, and rocky outcrop was endowed with divinity" (p. 29), that the
ancestors were reverenced and perhaps contacted for purposes of
divination. She proceeds to discuss the role of the druids as mediators
and mentions Celtic festivals.<p>

The Third Chapter, taking a closer look at Classical references,
mentions the problem of authorial bias, refers to magic and healing,
astronomy and mathematics, immortality and re-incarnation.<p>

Chapter Four takes a closer look at archaeology, considers the
hierarchical nature of European Iron Age society, torcs and mistletoe,
ceremonial head gear, wands, rattles, bells, trumpets, ritual deposits
in bodies of water, cauldrons, funeral feasts and grave goods.<p>

Chapter Five examines sacrifice and prophecy, especially the oft
repeated Classical references to human sacrifice. This includes mention
of decapitation and the treating of the heads of prominent enemies as
precious objects. She reports on the find of Lindow Man, who seems to
have been ritually killed, as well as other bog bodies and the finds of
sacrificial animals. Various means of divination (e.g. augury,
examination of entrails, inference) are mentioned, as well as the
Coligny Calendar, though it's noted here that the words MAT(U) and
ANM(ATU) may mean these months had 31 and 30 days, rather than they were
lucky and unlucky. There is also reference to healing sanctuaries in
Gaul.<p>

Chapter Six takes a look at female druids, mentioning the difficulty
of interpreting archaeological remains, and stating that the written
evidence (Classical and vernacular) does support the existence of some
dominant Celtic women. Some such historical figures, e.g. Boudica and
Cartimandua, are mentioned, as is the contact between Roman emperors and
prophetesses stated in the Augustan History, and references to Celtic
witchcraft in the Roman Empire and in Irish and Welsh myth. Among such
references here are Scathach, teacher of warriors, and Fedelma the
Prophetess. Green cites Pomponius Mela for accounts of Celtic virgin
priestesses.<p>

Chapter Seven describes: Celtic holy sites, groves, bodies of water,
shrines, though, "Architecturally, there is little to distinguish a
shrine from a house or barn" (p. 110), some archaeological shrine sites,
such as Zauist in Bohemia, Roquepertuse in Gaul, Harlow and Bath in
Britain, (inferencing that there would be resident clergy) the concept
of "Ritual enclosures," by a ditch and also through use of wells or
shafts.<p>

Chapter Eight takes a closer look at Irish myth and Saints Lives. She
informs us that some scholars consider the Irish tales to be, "Largely
invention." She mentions: both the beneficial and malefic
characteristics of druids in the Finn cycle, the power of satire, the
ability of druids to shape-change, the prophetic powers of Cathbadh, the
bull sleep ritual, the ritual marriage of the king to the goddess of
sovereignty, the use of ogam and the encounter with Christianity.<p>

Chapter Nine examines the Druidic Revival of the Meso-Pagan Period.
Among prominent personalities treated are: John Aubrey, William Stukely,
John Toland, Henry Hurle with his Ancient Order of Druids and its
offshoots, as well as William Price and Iola Morganwyg.<p>

Chapter Ten concerns the Neo-Pagan Period and it is followed by a
directory of modern druid organizations which includes ADF.<p>

This is an interesting work, well worth the read.
