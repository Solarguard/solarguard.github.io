<p>Andre Norton was Ace's (first major SF paperback publisher) top author, most popular and most prolific. Her voluminous writings include some excellent fantasy and science fiction. This site considers her science fiction. At present, it offers reviews, summaries and notes of some two dozen of her novels, a look at the common background to her Galactic Civilization stories, a comprehensive listing of planet names in these some three dozen books and a brief statement of her lack of vision. It also offers a link to the Andre Norton official webpage. This section was last updated on September 21, 2008 with relatively minor editing of a number of the reviews.<p>
