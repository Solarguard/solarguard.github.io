Note: I, Michael McKenny, initially hand printed my summary of these twenty volumes, including this volume 8, for my personal study and am now in 2023 typing it up. I may not have been as precise as I could have been in putting quotation marks around  each group of words that are exactly quoted from the author. After all, the entire thing is basically the work of Penfield Roberts as polished (see preface) by Crane Brinton and editor William Langer.

ix Late Professor Roberts submitted a draft of this volume in the Fall of 1941. Pearl Harbour intervened. Professor Roberts passed away in the Fall of 1944. Professor Crane Brinton of Harard, the author's close friend, carefully went over the whole manuscript. Professor Roberts would have liked to thank his friends, Professor H.L. Seaver of MIT and Dr. O.H. Taylor of Harvard.  

xi No period is as neglected as this one. It was not spectacular. It had few, if any, imposing personalities. Much can be learned from such transitional periods. The book's main theme is an effort to reconcile attachment to the old with the demands of the new. Failure led to revolution.

I i. (1-2) The End of the Age of Louis XIV: On August 26, 1715, Louis dying advised his five year old successor to avoid his wars and lavish expenditures. These wars were the real first world wars.
ii. (2-4) The Problem of Stabilization: The three devices to keep peace in Europe are: an empire, a federation and a balance of power. No Eighteenth Century state in Europe was strong enough to re-establish a Roman style empire. The idea of a federation existed, though not its practical or popular support. What remained, the balance of power, could not endure in a changing world. Aristocrats wanted war, small wars in which to gain glory. Pacifism is bourgeois. What existed and contended at this time were dynastic states, not nation states.  
iii. (4-7) The French Succession: The sickly five year old Louis XV seemed all that stood between peace and war. The regent, the Duke of Orleans, is accused of much, but Louis XV's survival disproves such rumours. The Duke of Orleans made concessions and sought to divide and rule. His most influential advisors were: John Law and Abbe Dubois.
iv. (7-11) The Jacobite Failure: King George I succeeded Queen Anne on August 1, 1714. James Stuart was king by divine right, but his Catholic Faith precluded his rule. George I was 54 when he became king. He did not speak English and made no effort to learn it. He was not popular. A rebellion in favour of James III was quickly suppressed.
v. (11-12) The Barrier Problem: The Dutch manned buffer forts. England was recognized as a great power.
vi. (13-18) The Italian Question: The Treaty of Rastadt (March 7, 1714) gave Charles VI Milan, Naples, Sardinia, Mantua and the Spanish ports in Tuscany. The English navy had control of the Western Mediterranean, because of the British new strongholds of Gibraltar and Minorca. Spain's deprivations and ambitions made her policy aggressive. Venice was at war with the Turks. Only Genoa in Italy enjoyed peace. In 1715 Spain seized Majorca. In 1717 Spain resumed her war with Austria. Spain seized Sardinia. In 1718 Spain took Sicily. Austria made peace with the Turks. England transported Austrian troops to Sicily, where, with difficulty, they prevailed over the Spanish. While the British prevented Spanish troops from leaving Sicily and Sardinia, France invaded Spain and destroyed the naval base and dockyards at Pasages. Spain's reverses on the field, at sea and in diplomacy led to the dismissal of the Chief Minister, Cardinal Aberone. Spain accepted peace in 1720. 
vii. (18-20) Stanhope and Dubois as Peacemakers: Stanhope and Dubois sought an alliance between England and France. The Dutch joined the alliance.

II i. (21-24) The Swedish Succession: Peter the Great's victories in the Northern War cost Sweden her empire. Charles XII's death without heirs led to Ulrica, then her husband, as monarchs. The Treaty of Utrecht recognized Prussia as an independent power. Frederick William I's reign began on February 25, 1713. Prussia, Poland and England were ruled by electors able to exert action independent of the Emperor. In 1720 Prussia made a separate peace with Sweden. The idea existed of partitioning Poland.
ii. (24-25) The Baltic Question: Russia's thrust into the Baltic worried England, depending on Baltic timber for her ships. England's complexities and shifting party influences had George I allied to Russia, while Stanhope's aim was to prevent complete Russian victory. 
iii. (26-27) Russia and Europe: Russia was now a great power. In 1717 Peter the Great again visited Western Europe. He sought a French alliance. This failing, he sought peace with Sweden.
iv. (27-30) The Hapsburg "Drang Nach Osten": The Turks, threatening Vienna in 1683, were driven from Belgrade in 1717. They had driven Venice from the Morea. Pope Clement XI announced a Crusade supporting Venice. Venice appointed Johann Mathias its defender, providing him many mercenaries. He defeated the Turks and seized Belgrade. He was cosmopolitan and joined the Hapsburgs. Ten days after Belgrade fell, Spain attacked Sardinia. Turkey made peace.
v. (30-32) The Treaty of Nystadt: England wished to weaken Russia in the Baltic. Peter the Great refused. England failed to incite Turkey against Russia. Sweden recognized Russia's gains in the Treaty of Nystadt.
vi. (32-35) The European Balance in 1721: Balance existed, though without means to preserve it. Ideas remained generally medieval or Roman. Nationalism existed, but before 1789 made little impact. For some years after 1720, Europe was spared large, competing sets of alliances.

III i. (36-39) The Conservative Reaction: 1715 was very different from 1945. There was yearning for times before the war, a return to normality, to peace. This conservative hope considered a ruling class balance to royal absolutism, an example from previous days, back to Charlemagne if necessary. Locke's primitive social contract simply pushes this craving to its origin. There was feeling that central authority required a moderating influence, though not in Prussia, where Frederick William I continued strengthening his army and his bureaucracy. 
ii. (39-54) Revolts of the Nobles: The royal Leviathan had weaknesses: In England Stuart pretenders until 1745; in France, Louis XIV's five year old successor; in Russia, instability between the reigns of Peter the Great and Catherine the Great; in Austria the last male Hapsburg seeking to assure the throne for his daughter; in Sweden, Charles XII's successor administererd as Chair, with only two votes, on a council. Sweden also had a secret committe of a hundred or more members. There were two main factions in Sweden, the Caps, led by Arvid Horn. They favoured peace with Russia prevailing until 1738. France had a regency council of eleven. There were six French subcouncils: Ecclessiastical, External, Finance, Internal, Navy and War. A seventh (Commerce) was soon added. They squabbled. After three years, they were dissolved and six ministries re-established. These had been largely composed of nobles who had proved poor administrators. English nobles exerted influence. Parliament had passed a law limiting offices, including Parliament to native born. George I, more Hanoverian than English, appointed his own ministers. His cabinet may have spoken French, when the King was present. The House of Commons largely represented the landed gentry. George I did appoint English ministers and heeded their advice. England's curbing of royal power came from common sense compromise. Holland was ruled by a merchant aristocracy. In Russia, clerics joined nobles in opposing  Peter the Great. They plotted around Peter's son Alexis, but were defeated. Peter asserted the supremacy of state over church. After Peter, there was a strong reaction against his innovations. Only with Catherine the Great was monarchical power firmly exerted. Poland had no strong central authority for nobles to react against. The country was ripe for partition.
iii. (55-62) Church and State: Religious sentiment, both Protestant individualism and Catholic universalism, limited support for state authority. The French monarchy exercised secular power and considerable control over Catholic institutions and procedures, for example, appointing bishops and approving communication between them and the Vatican. Jesuit involvement in religious difficulties in France and Germany, while asserted, lacks documented confirmation.
iv. (62-72) The Growth of Central Authority: Central authority strengthened. The rise of Prussia is a classic example. Frederick William carefully managed his realm, increasing revenue and reducing non-military expenses. He drew the privileged into state service, military and civilian. He developed an effective civil service. The Hapsburg Charles VI's main concern was ensuring his daughter, Maria Theresa, succeeded him. The diverse Hapsburg lands were slowly moved toward central control. Spain, not Poland, witnessed the growth of royal power. Peter the Great's circumstances testify to Europe's great diversity in this period.

IV i. (73-75) The Impoverishment of War: War had left every government in debt in 1715. Severe measures were taken in Prussia, Sweden, Spain, etc.
ii. (75-79) The Bank of England and the "Banque Royale": Associations of businessmen financed the government. The Bank of England, founded in 1694, was the most important of these, among other things financing the Industrial Revolution. The Bank's influence, as the Treasury's financial agent was great. It and the Bank of Amsterdam could focus the greater part of their countries' financial resources than such lands as France. England and Amsterdam paid German troops in the War of the Spanish Succession and boosted their traders' prosperity. Scottish John Law in 1716 was granted a charter for a Banque Royale in France.
iii. (79-86) Sinking Fund and Visa: English merchants were influential in Parliament. French merchants exerted indirect influence on the bureaucracy. There was extensive discussion re paying the government debt; Walpole's reduced interest rate was implemented. This called for the saving to be put toward paying down the principal, although a sizeable amount of the debt was in annuities. England viewed the debt as national in contrast to other lands that saw it as the monarch's personal debt. England's credit was high, the French crown's low. In France many suggested repudiating the debt. Actually, interest was reduced. The brothers Paris were appointed to review old debt and oversee new debt (the Visa). Wartime speculators and fraudsters were prosecuted. France's Parliament sought to scrutinize the Kingdom's finances, but it was composed of aristocrats, not businessmen. British merchants exerted greater political influence.
iv. (86-96) The Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles: The two bubbles were connected. Law's system was important for France's economic development. Attempting to overcome French war debt, as England seemed to be doing with its South Sea venture, Law aimed to raise the population and income of France. Many, including tax collectors, opposed Law. His use of paper instruments, issued in excessive quantity, produced the bubble which burst. England had its bubble with George I and his favourites participating early. Robert Walpole became prime minister when the South Sea bubble burst in September 1720. He averted national calamity possibly resulting from the collapse. France was in bad shape before Law and worse after him. Cardinal Fleury's efforts from 1726 markedly improved France's situation. France was largely an agricultural country with considerable local production.
v. (96-98) The Ostend Company: The British and Dutch sought to suppress Belgian competition. The Belgians responded by trading with China and India. Belgium's Austrian overlords chartered the Ostend Company in 1723. It had six successful trading voyages to China in seven years. Dutch opposition only intensified anti-Dutch sentiment. England secured the suspension of the Ostend Company in a 1731 treaty with Austria.
vi. (98=102) Asiento and Interlopers: The slave trade was economically vital to European nations, many of whom had posts in Africa. The Asiento was the agreement to provide slaves to Spanish America. It permitted British vessels there. The South Sea Company invested heavily in anticipation of this trade, only to learn that the deal would give them only 43% of the profits. They may actually have made 75% and found it unprofitable, as interlopers could undersell them. Proposals for a slave trade monopoly met arguments that this would not be in the interests of plantation owners. Free trade with France was rejected as being against British interest. Law had sought to strengthen the state, but failed.
vii. (102-103) Implications of Economic Progress: There was continuing economic advance in this period due to gradual agricualtural and industrial improvement and especially in commercial methods of credit, joint stock companies, etc. In this period businessmen welcomed state support, including nationalist exclusion of foreign competitors.

V i. (104-106) The Force of Tradition: Louis XIV's absolute power enabled him to wage disruptive wars, destabilizing economies. Such absolutism seemed understandable and Spanish and Dutch attempts to prolong more medieval methods seemed not to be the answer. Prussia rose through its attitude of state service by all classes. France, as Fleury demonstrated, depended on personal acumen to achieve and maintain harmonious wellbeing. Circumstance provided England with the personalities allowing effective Parliamentary balancing of authority and liberty. National leaders in this period, in their various ways, strove for stability.
ii. (106-109) The Unchanging Countryside: In this period, traditional country life continued. The lord and the clergyman remained local authority figures. Differences of open and enclosed fields existed. Crop rotation continued. Farming was largely subsistence. The commons advantaged this. Population pressures began to be felt in some areas. Noble and peasant depended on land.
iii. (110-116) Systems of Land Tenure: Land use mattered at this time. Most paid rent or dues. Often families continued for centuries on the same land, disturbed only by bourgeois capitalist schemes to extract profit from sheep, etc. The lord could owe a fee or due to a higher lord, the king or a religious body. Tenures were diverse, some ending if a family line ceased. Some dues persisted long past this period. Landlords, living well, better than previously, sought to increase their income, though often rents could not be raised.
iv. (116-120) The Dead Hand: The Church, often holding much land, guarded stability. It was owed dues, though provided education, charity, etc. Much payment to the Church was in kind. Some clergymen farmed Church land. Some Church land was leased. The Catholic Church frowned on individual liberty and capitalism.
v. (120-124) The Bourgeoisie: There already were employers and workers and cities with significant manufacturing, banking and commerce. Such cities were considerably diverse. The free city of Frankfort is considered (pp. 120-124) as an example. It had its own army, coinage, bureaucracy, Lutheran supremacy, Jewish ghetto, five ranks of burghers, each rank with its own garb, guilds excluding outsiders and competitors, a stronghold of tradition, though as the Goethe family demonstrate, talented newcomers could find a place.
vi. (124-132) The Corporate Ideal: In the Old Regime, one fit into a hierarchy with numerous grades, each of which contained rights, however unique and diverse. Heretics were now more likely ignored in advanced countries than executed or exiled. Orphans were apprenticed to guilds. The able bodied could generally find work. Poor relief was a local, parish responsibility. There were poorhouses. London, with almost a million people, had a proletariat living in appalling conditions. London lacked government provision of education, sanitation, police, etc. Its death rate was higher than its birth rate. The London mob could be roused. Hospitals and asylums were of little benefit to their intended residents, as bedlam exemplifies. Parliament passed a law in 1723 authorizing workhouses. By 1733, one hundred parishes had them. In Catholic countries, charity better helped those in need. Prussia granted poor relief.
vii. (132-139) Patronage and Leadership: Tenants voted as landlords instructed, easy to verify with no secret ballot. Often there was only one candidate. As Justices of the Peace, the gentry exerted additional influence. Patrons assisted their entire household, family and servants. Many sought to become clients. Such patrobage was widely prevalent. Appointment to government positions depended on it more than on merit, though merit did determine army appointments. Parliament did function well, maintaining England's strong international position. Patronage existed in preRevolutionary France. There were local and national aspects of leadership, with such nations as Italy and Germany often battlegrounds due to their lack of unity. Local leadership was often hereditary with or without talent.

VI i. (140-143) Tabula Rasa: Newton's laws in physics prompted hope that social and psychological laws could be discovered. Hume saw the human mind at birth as blank, tabula rasa, missing innate concepts. Freedom of thought was advocated. The Church found this disquieting. 
ii. (143-147) The Law of Parsimony: Newton suggested simplicity in understanding science. He experimented. Pope listed two principles: self love (passion or emotion) and reason. Self interest is seen as advancing general well-being. Pope's ideas, common today, impressed those of his age. Hume held understanding to be provisional, absolute truth to be unattainable. 
iii. (147-158) Liberty and Law: Balancing liberty and law was especially interesting. Not the often customary and  varying legal systems, but natural law attracted thinkers. Liberty included religious toleration, freedom from conflicting churches' domination. It meant a moderation avoiding the fanaticism of the religious wars of the past. Liberty meant the freedom to live peacefully on one's estate, express freely one's opinions, go about making profit, unburdened by religious or secular authorities. This was laissez faire. Fleury and Walpole exercised royal authority so wisely, mildly that they aroused little complaint. Some of their successors behaved otherwise. With peace, nobles spent more time on their estates and less in court intrigue. Voltaire praised British tolerance and Parliament's check on royal power. He approved of England's experimental science, including in its introspective psychology. Locke published in 1699, was important for his influence on our period. Liebnitz was also influential. Locke used common sense more than logic. He wrote of natural law, right of liberty and right of property. Locke wrote justifying the revolution of 1688. England was predominantly rural, more in tune with neglected Althusius than with Locke. And France, had it peacefully extended itself to match politically its cultural reach, in a European federation, might have spared history Locke's resulting nationalism. Locke's equality related to natural rights to the fruits of one's labors, something different from levelling, from despotic uniformity. French jurists distinguished absolute from arbitrary power.
iv. (158-167) The "Right of Property": This right, embodied in law, supported the rise of capitalism. Locke was not advocating capitalism, but opposing royal absolutism. He argued that one had only a right to what he could use before it spoiled. Money doesn't spoil. Terms were not used consistently. Landowners considered the medieval complexity of rents, dues, annuities, etc. their property rights. Newton had invested in stocks, leaving a substantial amount of these on his passing. Squire Purefoy left detailed financial records. He lived well on a few hundred a year, augmented by his land's produce. Sombart attributes three key concepts to capitalism: "acquisition, competition and rationality." Reason, rather than revelation and tradition, became key. Businessmen and lords accepted Locke's assertion of their property rights, including those of their aristocratic rentiers.
v. (167-173) The Enlightenment and the "Cake of Custom": Our period was one of peace, of comfortable tradition, of identity as family members and awareness of other personal ties. Nobles were helpful to lower class people in trouble. Harsh laws in theory were often softened in practise. The feudal legal complexities were disintegrating. There was a thought for more rational and uniform laws. While the old system faltered, significant diversity continued. 
vi. (173-175) A Note on Vico: Giambattista Vico (1668-1744) was unimpressed by reason and described his times as a period of decay. He saw history as a succession of cycles. Out of tune with his age, he would have been even more so with the later Enlightenment. 

VII i. (176-182) Instruments of Progress: Craftsmen made individual articles. Instrument makers helped advance science. Advances in mining coal and iron prepared the way for the Industrial Revolution. Mining was a royal right, often transferred to raise money. There were entrpreneurs, for example, Christopher Polham, able to propel industrialization forward, though lacking the means. Land transportation remained very inefficient. It was improvements in the banking system and financing that enabled technological progress. An important field in this period was ship building and development of better instruments to determine location at sea. Hadley and Godfrey brought the sextant into use Harrison developed an effective chronometer. Fahrenheit, Celsius and Reaumur were working on thermometers during this period. Making better cannons and clothing armies may have contributed to industrialization. 
ii. (182-183) Comforts and Conveniences: The gentry enjoyed well crafted articles. Their homes lacked only such modern utilities as heating, plumbing and lighting. Architecture, baroque and rococo, was coming back into favor.
iii. (183-186) Ceremonial as a Useful Art: There was elaborate ceremonial. In the hierarchical society, knowing one's place was important. The ceremonial was a refined art. There were impressive coronations and lavish embassies.
iv. (187-200) Artifice, Pattern and Eloquence: These three words distinguish this period's art. This period's art was decorative. Portraits and busts were not photographic, but conventional. Clarity and common experience, from nature and from a Classical literary knowledge, allowed a wide and effective communication in writing and in music.  Handel and Bach connected monody and polyphony. They also employed voice. Bach played and composed for the violin, being well crafted by Stradivarius (1644-1737) and his sons. Bach and Handel were both born in 1685. We know little of Handel, much of Bach, especially following his arrival in England in 1712. Both composers exemplify artifice, pattern and eloquence. Frederick the Great invited Bach to visit and compose for him. He did impressiely. Handel delighted in artifice. Both could create unconventional patterns. George II appreciated Handel's Messiah. Cosmopolitanism is another feature of this period's art. There was also middle class art, "Robinson Crusoe" its perhaps sole masterpiece.

VIII i.(201-202) "Quieta non Movere": Walpole and Fleury brought capable leadership to Europe's two leading kingdoms. Diplomacy continued in peaceful times.
ii. (202-212) Britain Under Walpole: Walpole, perhaps England's first prime minister, had a background uniting country squires and city merchants. He was efective in debate, especially on financial matters. He was a mediator aiming at peace and prosperity. He was practical. He sought to balance the power of nobility, gentry and business and to avoid civil strife over the unpopular Hanoverians and the somewhat favoured Stuart pretenders. He got along well with George I, George II and Queen Caroline, who all recognized his ability. He withdrew his excise bill, although it was appropriate, had royal support and had many advantages, but the unpopular word excise and the timing enabled his enemies to attack it. An intense publicity campaign was waged against it. He convinced George II to dismiss ministers who had opposed the bill, thus increasing the prime minister's power. The bill would have impacted American colonies, whose remoteness made instruction from home difficult to enforce. Walpole spoke favourably of the Virginia colonists. Perry, a prominent merchant, spoke against the bill. Walpole did not persist. He withdrew it. Walpole did not enforce the Molasses Act, unpopular in America.
iii. (212-221) The Policy of Fleury: Cardinal Fleury served from 1726 until he died in 1743 at the age of ninety. He sought prudent economy and peace. France's Old Regime wasn't a tyranny, it was inefficient. Fleury, like Walpole, mediated between the Kingdom's various groups. Lady Montagu writes of his positive transformation of rural France. France's Royal Road system surpassed in quality and safety England's private and local road maintenance. French military engineers were responsible for the country's superior roads. Fleury had a balanced budget in 1738. He brought out new coins in 1726 and achieved currency stability. He realized the practical advantage of tax farmers and granted them thr group of various taxes. He continued Church exemption from taxation. Codification of French civil law occurred in the 1730s. Professor Wilson refutes assertions that Fleury neglected the navy. Fleury promoted commerce.
iv. (221-223) Two Federal States: The Swiss situation was complex, with France declaring that it would protect the Swiss externally and with significant internal disputes. The Dutch stadholder in theory was a local, not a national, leader. There was rivalry. The Dutch already were capitalist. 
v. (223-227) Spain and Italy: Spanish prosperity increased, though much of it went to wars. Philip V's attempt to retire to a monastery failed on the death of his son. Philip's wife and the versatile minister Ripperda assisted him during his second period. Minister Patino helped stabilized the Spanish economy. Italy benefited from the Enlightenment and improved administration, its north faring better than its south. Hapsburg influence spread. Venice declined. Rome was not prosperous. Naples was a poor Bourbon possession. 
vi. (227-230) The Germanies and the Hapsburg World: The Hapsburgs ruled Central Europe, though the Empire was a loose confederation. Charles VI sought to pass on the throne to Maria Theresa. His disunited advisers and ministers weakened him. Prussia focused was strong with a much smaller population. Charles VI endeavored to better his economy. Charles VI died in 1740. He faced difficulties controlling Belgium. He lacked a harmonious team of efficient advisers and ministers. Prussia's Frederick William ruled Prussia prudently and economically.
vii. (230-234) The Moscovite Autocracy: Peter the Great reorganized the army and increased Russia's financial resources. He transformed Russia, enforcing service, especially military service. He promoted education. He was succeeded by Catherine I, Peter II and then Anna.
viii. (234-239) The Ottoman Heritage: The Ottomans declined. Alberoni failed to arouse a crusade in 1736. In theory absolute, in reality relying on officials, religious and secular, the sultans were constrained. The army deteriorated, including the formerly elite Janizaries. In the Balkans, Turkish aristocrats ruled relatively lightly, letting local communities have a fair amount of autonomy. Ahmad III (r. 1703-1730) preferred poetry and parties to administration and war. His grand vizier, Damad Ibrahim, sought peace and stability. Both died in a violent overthrow. Mahmud I (r. 1730-1754) also had a peaceful policy. The Turks left business to others, Jews, Greeks, etc. There was no Turkish middle class, no scientific advance.

IX i. (240-244) The Quadruple Alliance: Following Louis XIV's wars, the Quadruple Alliance formed to maintain peace. This consisted of England, Holland, Austria and France. Later Spain joined. England's Lord Stanhope had played a leading role in setting up the Quadruple Alliance. France had lost Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, but gained a Spanish Bourbon king. France viewed England and Austria as traditional enemies. Spain considered England, France and Holland traditional enemies. Austria aimed at expanding in the Balkans and elsewhere, conscious of the universal imperial ideal. It was a bit early for Prussia to feel itself the Empire's rival. Peter the Great looked to expansion in the Baltic and into Ottoman lands, and he looked for allies.
ii. (244-250) The Italian Troubles: A European Congress met at Cambrai in the 1720s. Elizabeth Farnese, seeking a throne for Don Carlos, offered Charles VI a Spanish bride, with less promise of reuniting the Hapsburg domains. France returned to Spain the young princess destined for Louis XV. France wanted an heir sooner than she could provide one. Spain was insulted, shattered the Quadruple Alliance, ended the Cambrai Congress, allied with Austria and, briefly, with Russia against France, England, Holland, Prussia, etc. Tension lessened. Fleury calmed anti-English agitation in France. Walpole eased English pressures for war. Louis XV married and obtained an heir. Walpole and Fleury eased pressure in Italy, and Don Carlos peacefully obtained his land. Actually, he later became King Charles III of Spain.
iii. (250-255) The War of the Polish Succession: Poland had a weak central government and minority Polish and Lithuanian nobles dominating Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Russians, Germans, etc. This conflict, fought largely outside Poland, enhanced France's prestige. On the death of Augustus the Strong in 1733, a Russian army moved in to support his son Augustus III against the father-in-law of France's Louis XV. France attacked Austria, also a backer of Augustus III, on the Rhine and in Northern Italy. Fleury and Walpole prevented a wider war. The peace provided Lorraine to France, Naples to Don Carlos and Poland to an Augustus III still hampered by Poland's aristocrat favouring constitution.
iv. (255-257) War in the East: Persian successes over Turkey encouraged Russia to press Turkey. Austria joined in. Persia made peace. Turkey at first drove Russia back, but then Russia pushed into Romania. Austria made peace with Turkey. Austria gave back gains it had made from Turkey in a previous war. Russia made peace with Turkey. Russia kept Azov. France, a helper of Turkey, saw its prestige grow.
v. (257-261) The War of Jenkins' Ear: Newcastle provoked war with Spain. The incident of Jenkins' ear led to British insistence that British ships not be searched. Walpole was unable to prevent war.
vi. (261-263) The Balance Upset: Perhaps England's war with Spain could have been limited. However, in 1740 Frederich the Great ascended the Prussian throne and Emperor Charles VI died, providing opportunity to dispute the succession. Even such capable statesmen as Fleury and Walpole could not maintain Europe's peaceful stability.
