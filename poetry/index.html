<H1>Poetry</H1>

Michael McKenny grew up to the sound of Irish singing. He studied poetry formally and fell in love with Horace and others. He read much poetry and some was so musical he began to sing it. He has written poetry of his own since the 60s. At present, this site offers some of his English renderings of poems from other languages and some of his own verse, including "Envoy's Lament" and "Patricia and the Bear." Some other material of poetic interest may be seen in other Solarguard sections, for example, China. This site was last updated on September 29, 2006 C.E.<p>
