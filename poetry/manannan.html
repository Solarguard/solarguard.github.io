Manannan Invocation

Mighty mariner, majestic trusty boatman,
Peacefully proceeding, plowing waves,
Advancing so surely,
Manannan,
Seeing, seizing seaways,
Oarless your magic craft without sails,
Surging, Sweeping, soaring towards the further shore.
Ever answering your peerless sword,
Munificent giver,
Manannan,
With your viewing visor,
Slicing through obscuring fog,
Perceiving the so quickly attained desired beach,
We here yearning stand awaiting you,
Please come, unfailing guide,
Manannan.

Nature Spirits Invocation

Invited are you, dwellers of earth,
Inhabiting leaf, branch, stalk and tree,
Terrestrial, flowery spirits,
Beneficially arrive, enjoy.

Invited are you water thrivers,
Swimmers within waves and placid pools,
Spirits riverine, lacustrine,
Beneficially arrive, enjoy.

Invited are you aerial ones,
Surging, soaring so high in the sky,
Etherial, flying souls aloft,
Beneficially arrive, enjoy.
