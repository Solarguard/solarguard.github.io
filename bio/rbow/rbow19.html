Chapter Nineteen Violet

I awoke at dawn with the sun shining in the eastern window. For
several moments I thought what others might call a prayer. Then I
walked down to the ground level, where I had some vegetables and
bread for breakfast. Again, I found my teeth and tongue very
attentively chewing and tasting this repast, while my mind amazingly
followed the normal practise of this planet and visualized the
detailed composition of the food and its future intricate absorption
by my body. Again, my spirit gave thanks to the spiritual essence of
each item of food and to the one who had created it. I also drank
some water and berry juice, following the same beneficial and
reverent procedure.

I was just about to rise, when a voice sounded in the air. For a
split second, I didn't recognize it. Then, I realized that my
doorkeeper had uttered, "Is a visitor desiring to speak with the
Wizard of Green?" The reply outside was spoken too softly for me to
catch. However, I heard the doorkeeper say, "One moment please. I
will inquire if the Wizard of Green desires company just now."

I was very interested to learn who it could be. After all, this was
only my first morning here. Before I could reach a window to check,
the doorkeeper said, "The Wizard of Violet wishes to know whether or
not you are receiving visitors now."

"Let her in," I said.

She came smiling into the tower. "Hi, Green," she projected.

"Hello," I replied.

"I thought you might enjoy company now that you've had the
customary evening to get used to your tower."

"Customary? I recall Indigo called it traditional. Was it the same
with you?"

"Yes, except that I am the guardian of the Awnizan plains and
coastal cities rather than the South. Also, instead of studying the
stars, I have devoted considerable attention to herbs, healing and
the life cycles of all vegetation. It was this which led me and the
Violets proceeding me into a study of temporal spells."

"It is an amazing world and I'm overwhelmed to find myself so
unexpectedly a part of it."

"You had a lot to do with that," she projected. "Your predecessor
did not make a mistake in choosing you. The more I receive your
thoughts, the surer I am of that."

"You are kind," I projected.

"What do you say to us going together to Ardamar?"

I gave a mental start. "Are you sensing something?" I asked.

"Nothing," she replied. "It is normal prudence at this time to take
a look at the spots on our world where the forces of darkness were
especially active in the past. Red is being extra vigilant on Thway,
Yellow has gone to Awm, while Blue and Indigo are now on Angway."

"So," I mused with relief, "it is ordinary and commendable caution,
instead of any feeling of foreboding. I would be delighted to go,
especially with so attractive a companion."

"I'm more than three centuries younger than Blue," she projected,
along with a visual of a smiling flower. "Only two hundred and
twenty eight."

"Does that make you the youngest of the wizards?" I asked.

"You mean besides yourself? Your ring can provide you with our exact
ages. Never hesitate to ask it for anything you want to know, no
matter how insignificant the information may seem. Just because
sometimes it freely offers advice doesn't mean you have to wait for
it to do so."

"I'll try to remember that," I projected, as I mentally sent the
question to the ring and learned that Violet was, indeed, the
youngest on the Council next to myself, followed by Yellow and then
Orange. Red was the oldest after Indigo. The problem for me, so
unused to women, especially women so competent in magic, was that
despite chronological age they, especially Violet, looked so young
and attractive.

"You'll get used to it," she projected.

There arose a flare of confusion, as I realized that I had forgotten
to shield the thought.

"You'll get used to that, too," she projected. "You know, letting
a woman, especially one of my years, know you find her attractive,
is not the worst way to go about getting on well with her, at least
if she's me, at any rate."

"I would have thought with our computer swift minds, we'd not have
to worry about feeling embarassed and so on."

"When have emotions ever been ruled by intellect, no matter how
powerful?" she asked. The image of Spock popped into my mind. She
read it and replied at once. "Ah, but he was a fictional character.
And even if there are aliens like that somewhere, they certainly
don't live on this planet."

"Yes," I projected hesitantly.

"Come," she projected, "let's go to Ardamar."

The teleportation spell appeared clearly, hovering in the air above
me in the shape of a butterfly. I looked at Violet. She gave a
mental laugh. "I thought you'd like that touch. We have several
delicate and lovely insects here, but now I cherish these beautiful
ones from your native world."

And then my tower had vanished and we were standing on the slopes of
a hill. In front of us stretched a grassy field and beyond that more
rolling hills.

"This is the famous hill?" I asked. "The seashore lies on the other
side of it?"

"Yes, indeed," she replied. "This is where the ancient battle was
fought, where the Southern soldiers died defending the port of
Ardamar from the ultradimensional demon army."

I let my eyes sweep across the ordinary looking landscape. "It is
one thing to read of it, even in the Tower of Green, and another to
actually stand here," I projected. "It feels strange to see no other
people here. What about tourists?"

She projected another smile and the words, "I am even now renewing
the image of this spot on the high forest. We do not have the same
kind of tourism Earth does. Many people eagerly visit scenes of
natural beauty and joyfully call on family and friends. However, we
do not seek out spots which were sites of such deep collective
emotion. It is too trying for us, too overwhelming for our spirits.
Most people do not even visit such on the high forest. It is likely
that no one, except us seven wizards, has stood here physically for
a very long time, and we only come here because it is our duty."

A sense of awe swept over me. It was a combination of realizing this
was more a sacred than a purely historical site and the deeper
glimpse of the spiritual sensitivity of these people. Then the
weight of years here touched me. Compared to this the Alamo and
Thermopylae paled into insignificance. If the incredible sensation
of age was really true, this battle had been fought more than a
million years ago.

"It is true," she projected, reading my thought. "Who more than
Green should know the chronology of the ancient South?"

"And still it continues in the state it was," I projected, "without
geological changes."

"Orange is the colour most interested in geology. As I see it, there
are a variety of factors involved. Our planet is naturally, within
its life cycle, more stable than Earth. Further, we entrusted with
ensuring the wellbeing of our people, take care to safeguard them
from violent events such as earthquakes. Also, the deep debt of
gratitude owed to the heroes of Ardamar, has led us specifically to
ensure the stability, the upkeep, as Terran grounds keepers call it,
of this sacred site."

"It's impressive grounds keeping to weed out ice ages and
fluctuating coastlines," I projected.

I felt her glimpsing the images of Earth's geological past coming to
the surface of my mind. "Well," she projected, "The previous Green
did report on the existence of such in recent Terran times, but not
in detail. Now, I'm wondering at the extent of the survivals of the
human evolutionary tree, as well as the trees of the other animal
and vegetable species on the planet. For example, some of that data
seems to be underwater."

"Yes," I projected, "even without Atlantis. I've not really studied
it much, but I think there's something like that around Australia."

"Orange will find out before too long, if he's allowed the quiet
opportunity, and we'll likely be hearing something soon in his
reports." 

"Along with info on Hindu and Gregorian chants," I projected.

Again I felt her warm attention reading my recollection of Orange's
interest in these. "As Orange as the sun," she projected. "There'll
soon be branches of leaves on Terran underwater remains and mystical
chants."

"On the high forest," I projected. "That's an awesome thing."

"Don't feel intimidated by it. Take time. Let your awareness of this
planet grow. When you feel like stepping into the high forest, let
your ring guide you, especially in shielding, though Indigo will be
watching out for you. If you ever feel lost, just contact her, or
even me."

"Thank you," I projected. "I will."

"Great," she projected. Then she chose to return to the topic
suggested by what lay before our eyes. "You know even though we're
born here, we find the weight of our ancient history somewhat
overwhelming, too." Then she added and I realized that she did this
deliberately. It was not a question of forgetting to shield her
thoughts, "It is refreshing to meet someone from a young
civilization. Now, let's do what we came to do."

"Agreed," I projected.

Our two minds reached out together and deeply probed the psychic
atmosphere of this incredibly ancient spot where great heroism had
stopped deadly evil. We scanned for the least trace of dark magic.
All I could feel in the present was insect and animal life,
completely normal.

"Nothing," she projected at last. "Let's renew the Eye of Zaymon
spell to make sure we'll be alerted, if this spot is again visited
by offworld evil."

I nodded and joined her in the augmentation or recasting of the
spell. This one is somewhat similar to the Watcher spell on Earth,
which allows an adept to maintain an awareness of what is going on
beyond his physical presence.

"Now, if you wish," I projected, "we may return to my tower."

"I would be delighted," she projected.

A moment later found us on the ground floor of the Tower of Green.
The table now had two chairs in front of it. There were likewise two
plates, each with a waterberry, the choicest of Southern fruits,
upon it.

"I have just eaten breakfast," I projected, "If you have not, I
would be happy to add to the ceremonial greeting."

"I have also had breakfast. The friendship waterberry will do fine."

Aided by a quick query to the ring, I caused a single candle and
some aromatic herbs to appear on the table.

Violet smiled. "I see," she projected, "that you're taking my advice
about checking with the ring. This is very nice."

I bowed and motioned for her to sit down. She bowed and sat down.
She took a waterberry off a plate and brought it to her lips. I
could sense that she was offering silent thanks to the fruit and the
god and knew she was mentally performing the rest of this planet's
Southern eating ritual.

I picked up a waterberry.

"They taste especially good today," she projected.

"Thank you," I replied.

"Would you like to attempt divination using the seeds?" she asked.

"I would be more interested in the method the early Zih-hanians
developed using seashells."

Violet mentally laughed. Telepathically it was a rich musical laugh
that sent a thrill through my being. "I should have known," she
projected, "that the Wizard of Green would prefer that method."

"Well, if my information is correct, the shell method goes back to
the time of the First Empire."

"Exactly," she projected. "I was foolish to suggest the Wizard of
Green try something less ancient."

Again embarassed confusion arose within my mind.

"It's okay," she projected. "I'm laughing at myself. Please don't
worry about it. Anyway, I would be delighted to cast the seashells
with you." She waved her hand and thirty six shells appeared on the
table. They were of various shapes and sizes. They had been painted
in the six traditional Zih-hanian colours: red, orange, yellow,
green, blue and purple. Those islanders had obviously not considered
Violet and Indigo separate primary colours. Luck for me, Violet was
a separate Colour.

Violet mentally smiled and I realized she had read my thought. Well,
perhaps I wasn't making much of an effort to hide my thoughts from
her. I did find her attractive and...

"This will only work," she projected, "if you control your wizardly
abilities and allow the randomness of the shells an opportunity to
mesh with the will and knowledge of Ay-yar."

"But, if I've correctly understood, Ay-yar's the one who supports
wizardry."

"Right," she projected. "This is the chief distinction between the
theory of magic on this planet and that held by Terran magicians. To
be more precise, here there's the separate concept called wizardry.
We have our magicians, those with some psychic talent, who through
study can perform certain acts, that appear to be magical.

"On Earth a great many people of that ilk are nothing but
charlatans."

"Well," she projected, "I won't say that there are absolutely no
charlatans here. However, it is less easy to fool someone on a world
where telepathy is universal. Returning to the distinction between
magic and wizardry, a magician claims through study and practice to
have mastered certain poorly understood natural laws, for example,
that of the electromagnetic field around a human being. Orthodox
Terran science, from the reports I've seen, has not explored this
fully. Magicians may use metaphorical language, and bring in demonic
and angelic beings or they may use the language of modern psychology.
Still, they are artisans and technicians, however unaccepted their
craft may be in the eyes of your recognized academic and scientific
institutions. Here, as you'll see, when you check into this on the
high forest, things are much more complex.

"Anyway, a wizard owes all of her, or his, ability to the divine
bestowal. We may study for a long time. We may learn a lot about so
many fields from genetics to telepathy, from nutrition to dream
analysis, from mathematics to interstellar teleportation. Still, the
original magical force, the mana, is Ay-yar's."

"Yes, and he's quite a guy. He's almost able to make this old
atheist believe in gods."

"You're hardly old," she projected along with the visual of a green
butterfly with a smile on each wing. "And, I see that he has already
paid you a visit."

"Or, perhaps, he's let me visit him. I'm rather fond of him."

"One more reason," she projected and I could hear the softness in
the mental words, "for me to be rather fond of you."

I think at this point I would have reached for her. However, into my
mind came the visual of a finger held up. She projected, "First, let
us try the divination." That mental finger swung to indicate the
shells and she projected, "Close your eyes, both physical and
psychic."

I did as she suggested. I could sense only that she was swirling
those shells around, granting them randomness to use her expression.
"Now," she projected, "pick five of them, any five, one after the
other, placing them in whatever pattern you believe you are
choosing." This thought came in an altered tone, as she was using
the traditional cadence, as well as the very words, of ancient
Zih-hanian shell casters.

I reached out and while I clearly had a traditional tarot pattern in
mind, one card in the middle, with one card in each of the cardinal
points, I found that my hands almost on their own placed two in the
centre and left the bottom, the south, blank.

She didn't make a sound, physical or psychic. I opened my eyes.

First, I looked at the three outer shells. In the spot I would have
attributed to Will or Present Influence was a green respite shell.
In the past position was a green illness or death shell. And, in the
future spot stood a green action shell.

Then, I let my mind take in the nature of the two shells in the
middle. There. standing side by side were the green and purple
happiness shells.

"I guess I shouldn't be surprised," I projected to her.

"Nor I," she replied. "This has all the marks of a true reading,
from its recording the passing of the Wizard of Green to the
prediction that we'll be happy together."

I could read very clearly that now she wished for me to reach for
her, and I did...

Violet and I began to spend some pleasant time together. Although
there is that great difference in tourism here, one of the
reverential duties of every new Wizard of Green is to visit the site
of the Tower of Erissa. She accompanied me there, as well as to
several villages throughout the South, especially significant to my
colour. Another amazing aspect of this planet is that it is
posturban. The largest city, really only a town, consists of barely
twelve thousand people. The vast majority dwell in villages or
isolated unimposing cottages in the country. Yet, people here, tied
together by the high forest, are intently aware of events across the
Continent and Isles. Also remarkable here is the harmonious blending
of intense enthusiasm at great advances in knowledge and a stable
sense of serene traditional tranquility.

Violet guided me into the high forest and there showed me many
marvellous things, not the least of which was the a deep respect for
privacy combined with tremendous friendship and openness which so
permeates journeying within its expansive bounds.

However, fascinating as was my exposure to the vast complexity of
the constantly growing high forest, it could not hold my attention
when Violet invited me to have a look at her tower. It was in a mid
afternoon that we appeared in the sky above lofty Mt. Zhayroon. It
provided me with a spectacular prospect of the Awnizan steppe to the
southeast, the great forest to the northeast, the northwestern plain
and the drylands to the southwest.

"This is even more spectacular than the ring suggested," I
projected. However, what really drew my eyes was her tower,
especially the area immediately around it enclosed by hedges
spelling out the letters "health" in the Awnizan language.

"I can see that you appreciate the Garden of Health," she projected.
"I'm glad."

"On Earth it would be called a maze," I informed her.

She projected a visual of a geenee bird laughing. "Hardly a maze.
All a visitor needs to get around is the knowledge of how the word
"health" is spelled. Each area of the garden contains a number of
herbs especially influential in the treatment of a specific kind of
ailment."

"It's very impressive," I projected.

"Thank you. My predecessors and I have been working very hard on
this for millennia. I see from your mind your vision of modern
Terran medicine. I will not comment on that. However, here
experience has taught that the body itself has the ability to remain
healthy, provided the proper balance is maintained in nutrition,
exercise and relaxation."

"I agree," I projected. "It's not necessary to convince me, but some
other inhabitants of my planet. I believe one major factor is that
for most of us the future is so unstable that there is no real
incentive to avoid unhealthy diets or lifestyles. After all, when
one has doubts as to whether he's going to be alive in a week or a
year, how can he be expected to worry about behaviour which will
only affect him twenty or thirty years down the road. Here, where
the future has been so secure for so long, it's easier to realize
the relevance of being concerned about the state of health so far in
the future.

I received the visual of a dusty dirt road curving just ahead.
"Twenty or thirty years," she projected, "is such a short time."

"Here, perhaps."

"Come," she projected, "I'll show you some of my favourite herbs."

"I'd be delighted," I projected along with a visual of me smelling a
pretty flower.

"I didn't mean to imply this was a flower garden, though some of
them do smell nice."

After we had strolled through a part of the herbal garden, she led
me into her tower. This contained the same basic three storey
symbolic division as mine. There were, however, differences
displaying both the influence of nearby Awnizaw and her individual
character. It was more than the prevalence of the colour violet and
various other shades of purple. There were intricate art forms on
the walls and hanging from the ceiling. There were exquisitely
beautiful carpets on the ground floor, which was divided into
several rooms. There were musical instruments.

She took in my observation and assessment and I felt the warm glow
of her pleasure at my approval.

"Violet, Green," came a relaxed telepathic call. It was accompanied
by the image of the Indigo's visage.

"Greetings," we projected together.

"Hello," replied Indigo. "Don't worry. This is merely a reminder
that we'll be having a ceremonial gathering in six days time to
welcome more adequately the arrival of the new Wizard of Green
amongst us."

"Thank you," I projected.

"We'll be there," projected Violet, along with a visual of the me
walking with her, hand in hand, into the Tower of the Wizards. 

"This means," I asked Indigo, "there's no sign of trouble here or on
Earth?" I had been following Orange's regular reports. These,
indeed, included material on underwater archaeology and mystical
trances.

"Correct," Indigo replied.

"Thank you," projected Violet. Even though we were enjoying the dawn
and springtime of our romance, Violet and I were constantly aware of
the Eye of Zaymon, the Watcher spell. We knew nothing untoward was
now transpiring on Ardamar. We both were delighted that this
communication confirmed that it was the same with our fellow wizards
and their observations of the other trouble spots on this planet and
beyond.

"I am delighted, too," projected Indigo, beaming the visual of a
sunny glade with birds, insects and small mammals moving about
unconcernedly. "It is good to enjoy peace, even for me not just
beginning a romance."

I blushed as I realized that again I had not shielded my thoughts
from a wizard.

"Don't think anything of it," projected Indigo. "We'll see you in
six days time at the Tower of the Wizards. Farewell."

"Farewell," Violet and I projected together.

This pleasant time Violet and I were spending could have driven that
welcome party for me out of my thoughts. Indeed, I felt as if I could
easily have spent several years without noticing the passage of time.
However, this was not to be.
