<h2>History of the Former Han Dynasty</h2>

Pan Ku, transl. Homer H. Dubs, Waverly Press, Baltimore, v. 1 (1938), v. 2 
(1944), v. 3 (1955)<p>

<p>It is hoped a fuller consideration of this major historical source will
be posted to this site in future.

<p>Pan Ku (d. 92 CE) was a member of an influential family. His history of
the Former Han dynasty and of the reign of the usurper Wang Mang is
quite fascinating. Actually, much of the extensive primary source
material for Imperial Chinese history has yet to be translated,
rendering this presentation of the annals section of Pan Ku's work very
valuable.

<p>There are many absorbing details for the reader interested in this
subject. And, some general factors important throughout successive
dynasties may be noted: the influence of families of the consorts,
questions of succession, external relations, theory and practise in
governance, imperial responses to portents, eunuchs, etc.

<p>One of the details that seems to have touched the translator and may
move many a reader is the incident where an imperial executioner is
denied access to a prisoner and so that infant lived to become emperor.
Dubs considers this emperor, Hsuan, "The best ruler in the whole former
Han period." (v.2, p. 190) His reign did witness that visit by the
Shan-yu of the Huns. "Such an event had never happened before, that the
emperor of a powerful neighboring state should come to pay homage to a
Chinese emperor." (v.2, p. 192)    

<p>Here are three very rich volumes. It is a goal of this site to provide
more comment on them and on other early Chinese historical works.<p>
