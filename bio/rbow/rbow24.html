RAINBOW Michael McKenny

Chapter Twenty Four Gold 

We proceeded onward in the wake of the fleeing Kaylooree. We
continued blazing with the light of all the colours of the
rainbow as we flashed across the newborn brightness of the skies of
his realm. Brilliantly we shone in splendour as we approached this
latest of the blots of former darkness along his path, this most
recent patch of former gloom sought by the lord repelled by our
glorious glowing. The denizens of that dot of departed darkness
welcomed with trepidation the arrival of their master now coming
just ahead of so startling a combination of light rays. As we drew
near to this his latest and final refuge, we sensed a sphere whose
surface ignited and began burning almost as fiercely as burns a sun.
The surface of the world was covered by molten rock. We paid no heed
to that, as we had paid no heed to the initial stages of the
transformations of the other planets of this dimension.

We sensed his agitation and the turmoil heaving the hearts of his
subjects. As potently as the rains of spring, began the emanations
of our thoughts to him. "Has the time not come," projected the
united mind of our Council of Colours, our harmonious rainbow of
light, "for you to cease your needless flight from the beneficial
Light?"

At first, he reacted as though the melody of our thoughts was too
repugnant to his being, too inimical to his existence, to be
endured. We felt him holding up fingers that looked more like claws
and vigorously thrusting these into his ears. However, clearly this
was only a pose, a visual image he projected in desperation towards
us. He knew well, as well as we, that there was as yet no air here,
as we know air, no medium to allow the transmission of normal sound
and speech. We were dealing with thoughts.

We could perceive the wailing and the screeching of those all around
him. "Give us permission, master, to turn on them, to overcome them
with our darkness, to force them away. Allow us to arise and reclaim
our dimension."

"I shall do it myself!" came the mental affirmation of the master of
negation." We sensed the feeling of relief and expectation that now
began to swim upon the surface of the thoughts of the beings upon
this newest of the worlds being born within this lower realm.

Then, their lord, in an act of proud defiance, somewhat like a wild
animal brought to bay, prepared to make his last stand. With a great
and noble gesture, he removed his fingers from his ears. With a
lofty and regal pose, he raised himself and turned his resolute head
to confront us. As a monarch travelling in grandeur, he ascended
from the surface of the planet so swiftly evolving beneath him and
advanced towards us. He gazed at us in defiance and determination,
seemingly unaware that behind him trooped the many who served him
here. He continued until he came to within what seemed to be about
four metres of us, though distance was still an imprecise impression
here. As he approached us he allowed his form to flicker through a
variety of concepts of demons and monsters. Those behind him
followed his lead. It was a heart shaking scene which would have
driven to flight many others from the realms above. We ignored the
display and continued to shine in our full splendour.

We sensed his frustration, his regret, his sorrow that so heroic and
so spectacular an advance had failed to remove us from his presence.
He resolved to add his projected thoughts to this articulation of a
banishing ritual. We felt the mental vibrations of his sonorous
telepathic voice as it resounded in striding and menacing tones.

"I am the Lord of the Lower Realms," he asserted with all the
emphasis at his command. "I am the great master of darkness. I am
Azathoth, the Lord of Chaos. I am Belial. I am Satanas. I am
Kaylooree." As he projected this declaration, these enunciations of
his names and titles to supremecy within the Abyss, he hurled as
well visuals to underline his claim. We saw images of him potent,
clear and vivid, gleaming scarlet in the flickering flames of the
medieval Terran's nightmarish hell. We sensed the dim gloomy shades
and shapes he wore as he clung with his enormous retinue to the webs
of Gvihlih-hihn envisioned Kaylaar. These visuals arrived with such
an accent of projected hate and horror, surely no one, he hoped,
could endure them. 

He added the finale to this impressive spell of banishment from the
abode of the lowest and formerly the darkest levels of the Abyss. 
"Leave me be!" he exclaimed. "Depart my realm or face my irrevocable
wrath." And these telepathic words arrived with the visual of seven
little candles engulfed in massive webs. As the candles flickered
and went out, the webs flared darkly with anti-light and awesomely
flamed in a tremendous lightless conflagration.

Neither the specific thoughts projected at us, nor the accompanying
visual images achieved immediately his intent. First, we softly
dispatched to him the visual of an envoy arriving with a message.
Next, we offered him the scene of a cupbearer holding out a vessel
abrim with the tastiest liquid refreshment. Next, came the view of
a crowned lord, and he could feel that we intended him. This ruler
we projected as receiving a garland of honouring and delectable
flowers.

"Something isn't working," he projected in complete surprise. "Your
thoughts are failing completely. I am receiving exactly the opposite
of your intended mental offensive." And, we sensed the equal
bewilderment of the host of his followers. They were all wondering
how we could be so apparently powerful, so mighty as to force our
way to this lowest level of the Pit, scattering its darkness and
giving birth to planets, while incapable of communicating even a
hint of an intended psychic attack, which was so garbled as to
arrive in the garb of a tribute.

"Your understanding is exactly correct," projected the rainbow. 

We followed this up by dispatching through the astral atmosphere,
through the thought kingdom in which his mind abode, a vivid visual
of himself arrayed in regal robes and crowned with a magnificent
diadem. This image showed him lifting himself up, standing erect,
holding himself in as proudly a pose as now he strove to do. And, as
we shared this perception of him, gradually we allowed the reality
to dawn, the perspective to become evident that he was far more
impressive, significant and valuable a being than the words and
pictures he had hurled defiantly into the air.

Now, we presented him with views of his brilliance, of him as a
splendid torch blazing with wisdom, of him as the warm and guiding
illumination of the hearth fire, of him as the comforting and
brilliant light of a universe.

"You," we projected, "are Lucifer and nothing less than that. For
all the dwellers of the worlds around you, you are the Light Bearer.
We pass on to you this greatest of the gifts in existence. Receive
this torch from our hands. Emblazon the pathways, the lifeways of
all who pass this way, of all born into this, your land."

"I don't understand," replied Lucifer. "Are you saying that you're
going to let me keep my throne? What was the point of your invasion
if you're not going to replace me?"

"And did you imagine," projected the Rainbow, "that we planned to
arrive as an occupying force? We are but the rainbow shining after
the storm, reflecting the light of high heaven here below. Now, this
light has been reflected in the mirror of your spirit. Now, your
realm has been transformed and all the seeds are sprouting. You are
the gardener. Tend it well. Make sure the harvest is realized."

A look of such astonishment appeared on his face, as had never been
there before. We could see the rapid progression of his thoughts.
There streamed past our consciousness a flickering procession of
images. We saw an angel as glorious as the sun, wielding a sword as
thunderbolts drove his army from the lofty kingdom. We saw the
shattered spheres of unbalanced force tumbling from the sky. We saw
thantay covered webs dropping into a fetid pool. As many different
images as there are people and mythologies poured at light speed
through our awareness, and they all said the same thing. Here, was
the very embodiment of the fall. Here, was the ruler of the realm
of those reeling and defeated. Never would that change. Always would
the loser loiter here amidst the demon dregs, the husks of creation.

"Has not the rainbow shone here?" we asked. "Does it not shine here
now? Is this not the spot where we come to a halt, to the end of our
long journey? Tell us, what is to be found at the end of the
rainbow?"

"I don't know," he replied, obviously bewildered.

We openly displayed the contents of our united mind. There stood the
common image of the rainbow arcing through a cloudy sky, moving
towards the horizon, and then, just as it reached the ground, the
visualization of a pot of gold, gleaming in the rain.

"You are serious," he projected in astonishment, for he read the
sincerity of our true thoughts.

"Of course. You are the guardian and the protector of a golden land.
Now, it is time for us to return whence we came. May the Light which
has reached here, the torch which we have passed on to you, blaze
forever sheltered and fueled by your august sagacity, wisdom and 
understanding."

Then, after we had thought that, we turned. We could feel the
reflected light still shining behind us. We read the exhileration
that was beginning to course through Lucifer's soul, as he realized
that it was true. We were leaving and not only was he still in
control here, but he was, as his name implied, the Light Bearer for
all the immensity of this plane.

"I will try," he projected after us. We felt the surging emotions
within the host of his subjects, as the realization penetrated their
minds that we were going, and that what we were leaving behind was a
luminous creation, their Light Bearer and a life that was going to
be completely different from anything they had dreamed possible.

As we began to retrace our trail of light here, we could feel that
the time of our fusion was drawing to a close. We sensed that soon 
we would separate into the individual colours of the rainbow. We
experienced the natural resistence to that resumption of normal
individual consciousness. During the journey back through the new
immensity of this place, we remained one. We felt the scintillating
thrill and excitement as we approached the planet closest to where
we had left Kaylooree, the world most recently, save one, to have
felt the impact of our arrival.

Astonishing it was to soar past a planet of attractive oceans, green
and verdant vegetation, fragrant flowers, melodious avian life and
intelligent life forms abiding upon a surface of a home they found
so breathtakingly incredible. They noticed us and sent their
grateful benedictions towards us.

"Thrice three blessings be upon you for all that you have done. We
believed we were condemned eternally to live in hell and you have
transformed our habitation into heaven."

"We have done nothing," replied the rainbow, "except shine so that
you could perceive the reality of your environment. Live and live
well now that you see where you live."

It was the same as we passed planet after planet, perceived their
glorious beauty, felt the life thriving upon them in all its so
precious and multifarious diversity and received the gratitude of
those awakened to their completely altered condition of existence.
We gave them the same truthful reply and hastened on towards our own
dimension.

At last, we moved past the very first world we had encountered here,
exchanged felicitous thoughts with its inhabitants and arrived at
the portal out of this expanse and into our native dimension. We
soared onward and for a short period of time our essence remained
united. Then, a minute moment after our passage through the portal,
we were again our individual selves. Seven wizards we were stirring
within our bodies so gently resting in the air just above the snowy
wastes of Antarctica.

"Our gratitude I extend to thee, Ay-yar," projected Indigo, "that
you have allowed us to return safe and sound to bodies healthy and
well."

I was thinking my agreement and felt each of the other colours doing
the same. There was a tremendous sense of awe and humility that we
who had calculated so precisely the liklihood of our deaths, we who
had acted according to our understanding that we were making the
supreme sacrifice, found everything fine, discovered even our bodies
still warm and unaffected by the cold environment in which we had
left them.

"One hundred and forty four microseconds," came Red's thoughts in a
very amused tone. His mind was open and the sources of that
statement were verifiable. Correct he was. We had only been out of
our bodies for that length of time. The entire process of the blaze
into Kaylaar and the transformation of that abyss into a garden had
taken no more time than that.

"Time down there obviously flows at a different speed," projected
Orange.

"Right you are," projected Yellow, "though perhaps Ay-yar had
something to do with that, too."

"It feels very strange," I projected, "that now there's no need to
scan to see whether Terra is safe from Kaylooree's influence."

I could feel Violet scanning anyway and her sweet appreciation that
my home planet was now as truly free of inimical occult influence as
I'd deduced it must be.

"Let us return now to Gvihlih-hih," suggested Indigo.

"Agreed," projected Orange. All the rest of us really did agree with
her idea, and in a very short instant we had left Terra's southern
area and stood instead, in solemn and almost silent thought, with
our heads bowed, at the edge of the sacred Pool of Tears.

I could feel the presence of the high forest, the vast system of the
planet's telepathic Internet. It was quivering with an excitement
and concern I had never noticed previously. The staggering awareness
struck me that the population of this planet had just lived through
a unique occurrence. Even though we had been away for so short an
interval, still it was the first time in the incredibly long period
of our Council's existence that all of us had been offworld.

I saw a tiny indigo leaf floating all alone in the air among the
many towering trees blowing in the telepathic breezes there. "My
very dearest Gvihlih-hihns," came the soft voice of the oldest of
us, "we owe you a tremendous apology. We are very sorry that we have
not kept our word to you. We swore the most sacred oath that we
would constantly look after you, guard you and protect you. You know
that we have left our home planet. All of us went, and none stayed
behind to do our duty here. We believe we had cause for that, that
the threat we perceived elsewhere was very great, and it could have
come here had we not gone when we did. Nevertheless, we broke trust
with you. If you wish, we will turn over our responsibilities to
others chosen here, more capable and more favourable."

It was a statement that utterly surprised me. After so spectacular a
triumph what ruler on Earth would imagine issuing such a suggestion?
And, in amazement, I watched other coloured leaves, violet, red,
orange, blue and yellow appear beside Indigo's one. I had trouble
understanding this, but no trouble projecting a visual of a green
leaf floating with the other six. "Me, too," I thought.

There came a hum from the high forest and a sound as softly tinkling
bells and a deliciously sweet frangrance. "On the contrary," came
the harmonious and agreeable thoughts of individuals from all over
the planet, "you have proved your capacity and worth by going where
the need was. We choose none others to replace you. We could not ask
for more, and would be foolish to think we might find anyone better
than you."

"Thank you," Indigo projected to them. Then, she turned her thoughts
to the forest god. "Ay-yar, thank you as well for the marvellous
extent of your blessings." For a hundredth of a second, there was
silence.

Then, came a reply in the woodsman's deep and good natured voice,
"Thank you for fulfilling your purpose, though do not imagine that
your purpose is finished. Perhaps, the apology was needed. Perhaps,
the people of this planet were owed your confession of oathbreaking
and your preoccupation with very serious business. I am glad the
people were able to perceive the honourable and necessary cause of
your departure from this planet. I am happy to add my voice to the
wise planetary consensus, to agree with the entire population of my
people on this world that you continue your duties."

"Thank you," projected Indigo again.

"Welcome you are," came his cheerful thought. "Until we meet again."
And, then he was gone, or at least we were less aware of his
proximity. The visual of the high forest was still present, but off
to the side, as it were. Around us, present were we seven and the
awesomely lovely location in which we stood.

"I think," projected Orange, "that I'll take six days of rest. My
kyola will be retuned and strummed anew. After that, I shall invite
you all to a tournament of Enochian chess."

"I will look forward to it, after I spend some time sailing upon the
seas of Yattashdor," came Blue's thought. I felt her heart yearning
for the previous Green and realized some poignant and melancholy
lyrics were going to result from her intended boat ride.

"The normal kind of chess is so pleasant and stimulating," projected
Yellow, "that I can hardly wait to try out this newer version. I
will, though happily enjoy those six days of rest. I've a few
scrolls to read and a pub or two in town to visit."

"My concept of relaxation," projected Red, "includes intrigating my
studies on the neural network with the data we've now accessed from
the Terrans. After that, I'll be there, maybe the first to handle 
two sides in the chess tournament."

"Perhaps," projected Yellow, along with a visual of Red staring in
bewilderment at a solitary king all alone on his portion of a chess
board. Mental laughter came from all sides. Then, one by one five
wizards vanished, with the wave of the hand and a phrase, for their
towers and other destinations.

Then, I was standing with only one other wizard. "I would rather not
spend that time alone," she projected. "I hope you are of like
heart."

My heart was feeling very moved. I guessed she could feel the host
of emotions swirling within me. Openly I projected in an amusingly
apologetic tone: "I really only remember some of the herbs in the
first letter of your garden of health. If you don't mind so slow a
student, I would be happy at the opportunity to learn more."

"With pleasure," came her reply. Together we made the motions and
thought the words of the teleportation spell. And, then there we
were within her so attractive, aromatic and beneficial garden of
health.
