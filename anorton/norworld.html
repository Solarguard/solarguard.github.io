A Start of a General Consideration of the Vision of Andre Norton

This essay continues a process of examining the general background of
the Andre Norton stories set in an interstellar civilization. A number
of years ago, this was done within the framework of connecting, even
hypothetically, these stories together as happening within the same
universe.

Obviously Crossroads of Time, Quest Crosstime and Star Gate, novels
depicting travel across universes, took place in different universes.
Although, one could posit that each Norton novel with the background of
interstellar civilization took place in a different universe, it would
be more reasonable to identify a number of universes, sets, providing
the background of these novels. Such may be done at some future date,
It was an enjoyable intellectual exercise to attempt to connect them all
together, as much as possible, even though it feels more likely there
were groups of stories in similar universes.

This essay examines the author's imagination in respect to the kind of
existence she depicts within the universe(s) she offers her readers.

Writers may be said to take one of these two broad sets of attitudes in
crafting inspired stories, in describing invented worlds, in offering
glimpses of existing society and views of places and times beyond the
here and now. One is to tell it like it is, to convey the hard truth
about the real world; the other is to shine a light on what could be,
illumine ideal, possible and potential achievement.

Andre Norton, although she is placing her novels in a fictional setting,
many far in the future, when humans have attained higher technological
capacity, is very much of the hard reality school when it comes to the
kind of life lived within this advanced technological setting.

Observed in general terms, an Andre Norton SF novel can be stated as
telling the story of a young person having to make it on her/his own in
an unsympathetic, unfriendly and harsh reality. She is not at all one to
imagine human social potential uplifting the species beyond the history
of humanity's past.

In her defence, the technological advances humans enjoyed in the decades
and generations immediately preceding her own failed to lead to much, if
any, such increased social potential. Wars, intense competition among
self centred and group centred humans at the expense of humanity, etc.
were the evidence of her own eyes, despite practical gains in knowledge
and know how in many fields of human endeavour.

So, she simply attributed these common weaknesses of the species to her
stories set in the far future. The contentious American ideal (not at
all restricted to that segment of humanity, albeit the dominant faction
in America quite vigorously asserts this dogma) is presented as the norm
in Norton future stories. Her characters move through a hostile dog eat
dog environment and survive because of their own talent, wits and a dash
of luck.

An observer notes that, sharing failure of vision with the overwhelming
majority of human speculative fiction, Andre Norton's seems incapable of
considering a co-operative, harmonious and humane civilization.

This essay may be extended in future to note some of the common traits
of her stories, the use of common terms, artefacts, institutions, dates,
concepts, etc. For now, this single point is underlined, that in this
allegedly visionary genre of speculative fiction, this very popular and
successful author is representative in depicting far future life as more
of the same hard reality as is found in history and the news of her
times.
