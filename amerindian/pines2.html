Chapter Eleven, "War Songs and Black Wampum" (pp. 252-268), begins
with Louis Hall who created the flag of the Warrior Society in the
70s and played an early role in the emergence and early activity of
the Society. There are the several versions of the Great Law, the
relatively little influence of Handsome Lake (strong elsewhere among
the Iroquois) on the Mohawks of Kahnawake. The Mohawks, unique among
the Six Nations, are more in tune with an older oral version of the
Great Law with a heavier militant component than the somewhat
Christianized Handsome Lake.

Not only the determination to resist oppression by arms, but also
such policies as developing a strong economic foundation are seen as
essential. Akwesasne's Doug George is the leading counterbalancing
voice to the warriors. Strongly advocating alternatives to violence,
he has become caught up in Akwesasne's factional conflicts. The more
pacifist view (the dominant one held by such chiefs as Tom Porter
and Jake Swamp) emphasizes that chiefs are "peace" chiefs and resign
to engage in combat.

The similarity of this disagreement to Third World liberation
struggles (Gandhi's pacifism vs Mandela's militarism) is noted, as
well as the fact the aim of both factions (recognition of Mohawk
sovereignty) is identical.

Chapter Twelve, "Shock Waves" (pp. 269-287), begins with Brad
Larocque, an Ojibway from Regina who came with other students,
joined the Mohawks at Kanesatake and was the Native in the famous
photograph staring eye to eye with a Canadian soldier.

Tom Siddon's attempt to have moderate Indian leaders criticize the
warriors failed. The frustrating land claims process is discussed.

   The deep flaws in the federal land claims policy were a key
   reason for the outpouring of support across Canada for the Mohawk
   warriors in the summer of 1990. p. 278

There were blockades, protests and threats to infrastructure across
Canada. British Columbia action achieved the first significant
admission from the provincial government that Natives have land
rights. Ojibways in northern Ontario blocked railways and highways
to back the Mohawks as well as to press for recognition of Ojibway
land rights. In Alberta the Peigan opposed damming the Old Man
River. The massive Quebec James Bay project is metioned.

Chapter Thirteen, "Rolling Out the Razor Wire" (pp. 288-318), begins
with Walter David Sr. signing a paper at a table with the federal
and provincial ministers and the perception this process was
recognition of Mohawk sovereignty. The signing ceremony included the
unexpected participation of a masked warrior and this enraged many
in Quebec. There was a riot at Chateauguay with a mob attacking a
police station and battling with police at Mercier Bridge. Quebecers
expected a quick move from the Canadian army, but the army respected
the military quality of the Mohawks and preferred a peaceful
resolution. Although Premier Bourassa, Claude Ryan and John Ciaccia
were level headed, others in the cabinet required some specific
military explanations to calm them down.

Some 2,650 soldiers were brought in. International observers
arrived. Two new government negotiators were brought in. Culture
shock struck when they encountered fifty four Mohawks. The
governments gave their negotiators no substantial capacity to
achieve agreement. They learned Mohawk history and were surprised
when Loran Thompson produced an Iroquois Confederacy passport
stamped by Canadian customs. Premier Bourassa was surprised, too,
when a negotiator showed it to him.

When the army arrived at the Kahnawake barricades, its commanders
met with leading warriors, demonstrated respect and began a viable
relationship. The troops sent to Kanesatake wanted to establish a
post closer in from the north. The Mohawk hesitation to agree to
that was due to their realization the army would then learn that
place was not guarded by the Mohawks. When the army advanced part
way, this was resented. Negotiations halted. Three leading warriors
from Kahnawake went to calm things down and attempt to set up a
working relationship between the Kanesatake warriors and the army.

White mob violence continued. An international observer escorted
clan mother Eba Beauvais at the docks in Dorval when a mob moved on
her. The army edged forward from the north. Unarmed Natives,
including women and children, tried to block the advance, but were
bumped aside.

Quebec's negotiator, Alexander Peterson, informed Bourassa that he
was finished, unless he was given something new to say to the
Mohawks. Bourassa called on the army to remove the barricades.
Preparations were made.

Chapter Fourteen, "Disappearing Act" (pp. 319-371), begins with the
some seventy five vehicles carrying the old, women and children out
of Kahnawake. This was delayed by police and set upon by mobs.
International observers were also targetted and stated they'd
received decent treatment only from the Mohawks. Bourassa ordered
the observers out. Clergymen stepped in to fill the gap, but they
encountered opposing mobs and uncooperative police.

The Iroquois Confederacy and others of the Six Nations had been
helping the people of Kanesatake and Kahnawake in a number of ways,
including by meeting with government officials such as Ciaccia, the
Quebec minister. On August 28th, Confederate negotiators brought
government and moderate Mohawks together. A Confederacy proposal was
largely accepted. Ciaccia's consideration of the outstanding
sticking point ("the question of legal protection for the warriors"
p. 327) was not supported by Bourassa.

Meanwhile, there was a verbal agreement that the army and Kahnawake
warriors would jointly dismantle the barricades at the Mercier
Bridge, that if the warriors put away their masks and guns, the army
would not look for them and that neither army nor police would enter
Kahnawake.

There were Kahnawake community meetings until 5 AM and it was agreed
their barricades come down. Jointly the Mohawks and army took down
the barricades. Military helicopters at night on August 28th flew
missions to create the impression the warriors had escaped by air.

The removal of Kahnawake's barricades came as a surprise to
Kanesatake. Some three hundred Mohawks left the territory. Quebec
police beat some Mohawks. The army advanced on Kahnawake territory
and placed razor wire at all its entrances. At Kanesatake the army
suggested warriors escape through an unguarded section of bush. The
warriors distrusted the offer, suspecting Quebec police would be
waiting. They also felt that simple escape would erase the political
statement they were making. However, there had been internal
conflict. The army advanced. Some hundred and fifty people were in
the community centre when the troops approached.

Chapter Fifteen, "Bayonets and Helicopters" (pp. 347-371), begins
with the army's advance, with some hundred and fifty people in the
community centre when the troops approached. Both Mohawk warriors
and Canadian soldiers refrained from armed combat during the
advance. Church leaders declared the community centre a church,
protected by sanctuary. It was not assaulted.

   The Mohawk women kept trying to calm the warriors. "We can't
   shoot," one of the women told the warriors. "The medicine people
   say we can't shoot or nothing is going to be on our side." p. 354

Oneida faithkeeper Bruce Elijah held healing ceremonies for the
warriors, while Oneida chiefs Terry Doxtator and Bob Antone
convinced army officers to allow time for these beneficial
ceremonies to work.

The advance on Kanesatake led Kahnawake warriors to move against the
Mercier Bridge. This drew a prompt military response. The soldiers
followed the withdrawing warriors into the territory and, following
a scuffle with some defending women, into the Longhouse.

There were confrontations in Kanesatake: army flares and bright
lights, Mohawk mirrors, determined women, verbal exchanges, loaded
rifles, sleeping Spudwrench captured and beaten by soldiers and then
recsued by Splinter. Spudwrench was in bad shape and the distrustful
circumstances were very unhelpful. Dr. Gorman drove in from New York
state and went with Spudwrench on the circuitous route of an
ambulance. Spudwrench was arrested on his release from hospital.

Chapter Sixteen, "Walking Home" (pp. 372-400), begins with the
feeling the Mohawks had won and their determination to overcome any
incitement to get mad. An eagle flew silently above, a good sign.
The army interfered with journalists (preventing supplies from
entering, cutting phone lines, attempting to stop cellphone
communication, interference with water and electricity). The
European Parliament protested.

At Kahnawake soldiers probing further into the territory unleashed
pent rage. Some three hundred unarmed people rushed the troops who
were going to Tekakwitha Island. June Delisle went in her wheelchair
to inform military officers that they were firing teargas not far
from a hospital.

At Kanesatake there was the wedding of Dennis Nicholas and Cathy
Sky. Parliament resumed with a very vociferous opposition on the Oka
crisis. The consensus among the Mohawks at Kanesatake was for
disengagement. Some simply walked around soldiers and escaped.
Quebec police attempted to nab them. Others were beaten by soldiers.

The Epilogue (pp. 401-422) begins with police beatings. Mohawks were
initially denied legal representation. Interrogations were conducted
with lawyers excluded. Some one hundred and fifty Mohawks were
charged.

   Most of the Mohawk spiritual objects, including the wooden masks,
   disappeared into the custody of the police or the army. The
   Mohawks pleaded with the authorities to give back the masks, but
   they were never returned. p. 404

   Corporal Marcel Lemay was the first victim of the Oka crisis, but
   he was not the last. An elderly Mohawk died of heart failure in
   early September, just a few days after he suffered the terror of
   the stone-throwing mob on the outskirts of Kahnawake. Another
   elderly man in Oka was poisoned by the tear gas that wafted down
   from the Pines on July 11. He never fully recovered, and died
   several months later. p. 405

Quebec and Canadian governments showed little significant interest
in seriously considering what had happened, including abuses of
civil rights or the more fundamental and long unresolved issues that
had precipitated Native unrest in 1990. Quebec police continue to
intrude in the territory. The golf course had been prevented. Mohawk
factionalism continued. The epilogue mentions also what some of the
participants have moved on to do at the time the book was written.

This book is a decent effort to provide some background information
and a somewhat detailed look at the confrontation at Kanesatake and
its consequences. It can't hurt for more people to encounter the
realization that this was not an isolated incident springing up out
of the blue, but one more chapter in a multi-generational story of
incompletely ethical relations by Whites towards the original
inhabitants of this land. The book is highly recommended.
