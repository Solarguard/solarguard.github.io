RAINBOW Michael McKenny

Chapter Five Theft 

I gave a mental start. My physical features were responding, at a
much slower pace, to our overt discussion about chess.

"No," I replied. "I am most intrigued by the Phoenician name. They
have exerted a certain fascination on me since I encountered mention
of them, and I've made a special study of them."

"Phoenicians?" asked Orange.

"Ancient sailors here," I replied, "far ranging voyagers, who
preferred trading and exploration to the more usual human occupation
of warring against other human cities and societies. The Phoenicians
are quite similar to the sailors of Sitoh."

"Then," projected Orange, "Yellow will be especially interested in
anything you have on them."

"You can ensure she's fully informed," I projected.

"Yes," continued Blue. "I knew that the Phoenician name of that
talisman would have been enough on its own to attract your interest.
And since I had no memory of you mentioning it, I suspected you
hadn't yet learned of its existence."

"What is it?" I asked.

"It is a magical implement of enormous power," she replied. "It was
supposedly found by Phoenicians on one of their voyages into the
Atlantic. They were said to have come upon it simply floating on top
of the water as they sailed by. That explains the name. They called
it 'The Gift of Yam Nahar'. That's the name of their seagod. This
was later altered a bit, after it was discovered that the god's gift
turned out to have magical capabilities. However, what records I've
been able to find of it suggest there's little godly about it.

"Its history from the time of its discovery is quite long and
varied. I've received a meg of data, straight text, on this. However
interesting the early material is, it's the more recent stuff which
is of greatest relevance."

I was receiving fascinating visuals along with this portion of her
exposition. There was an ancient trireme sailing over the blue
Atlantic and an object floating there drawing the attention of the
sailors. Then there followed a quick kaleidoscope of the known
stages of the artifact's journey from Melqart's gleaming temple at
Tyre, past the lighthouse that was a wonder of the world, through
the most famous library to, "a rose red city half as old as time,"
to a splendidly mosaiced study in a villa in an Antiochan suburb and
on towards the present.

"Well," Blue was projecting verbally, "Dee said that ever since his
time it has been kept secure and secret in England. First it was in
the Tower of London. Then it was transferred to New Scotland
Yard.

"It seems somehow he came across the thing during his travels on the
Continent. There's a gap in its history prior to his discovery of
it. He doesn't even know where it was before he found it. The last
previous trace the magicians have of it is in Venice about ten years
before Dee left England. He found it in Venice and on his return he
handed it over to Queen Elizabeth. He also gave her a letter in his
own hand as to the talisman's dark power and the need to keep it in
a safe place. This was in 1589."

"He certainly couldn't have felt very secure in keeping it himself,"
I mused, nodding mentally, "even if he did live almost twenty years
after that."

"Why's that?" asked Orange.

"He never really felt sure of his own safety," projected Blue. "One
mustn't forget how superstitious the people were here in those days.
A mob had plundered his house just after he left for Europe. So,
especially considering its potential for harm, he didn't want to
take any chances. He felt it would be far more secure if the Queen
put it in some unsuspected location and never let on that it even
existed.

"She hid it, along with his explanatory letter, in the Tower of
London, where they remained until someone stumbled across them in
the reign of Edward VII. When that monarch read the letter, he had
them instantly transferred in secret to Scotland Yard. It's kept in
a special safe, and no one at the Yard even knows what's in the box
they're guarding so carefully. They have never opened the safe, let
alone the box, once in all the time it's been there."

"Interesting," I projected. "It sort of reminds me of the way Yellow
has been entrusted with keeping an eye on the Talisman of
Yattashdor, which is quite different from how you maintain
guardianship," I added with a mental glance at Orange, "over the key
of Tanarath."

Orange nodded.

Blue projected, "Exactly."

"And, just where is all this leading?" I asked, though I had a very
dreadful suspicion that I already knew the answer. I was thinking
about the unnatural doubloon in the bookstore.

"There was also some disturbing data John Dee obtained from the
Akashic records concerning the origin of the thing, and the extent
of its capacity for harm. The most alarming aspect of this is that
he felt the Akashic record was incomplete. As you've no doubt
guessed, we were almost in time to try to stop it being stolen."

I glimpsed the visual impression of the opaqueness in the brilliant
astral record chamber, widely believed to contain all the knowledge
in the universe. I gazed with my mind's eye at the empty box
enclosed within a locked safe at Scotland Yard.

She did not conceal the extent this worried her. She clearly
considered this Phoenician talisman, so recently stolen, to be the
most ghastly and deadly object on the face of this planet, not
excluding stockpiles of nuclear and biological weapons. I had a very
great respect for the clarity of her perception and magical
awareness. As a result, I felt a wave of dread despair begin to
sweep over me. I quickly performed a mental calming spell and
waited.

"So you failed?" asked Orange. "I'm sorry to hear that."

"Do you know anything at all about the thief or theft?" I prompted.

"I know that it occurred," replied Blue. "That puts me ahead of
Scotland Yard."

"You mean they don't even know that it's gone?" asked Orange.

"No. And I myself don't know much beyond that. John Dee told us he
felt it was threatened. This was the reason Ay-yar, if that's who he
was, allowed him to communicate with us. We had already promised to
avoid spectacular use of magic, such as teleporting, or even
travelling in the astral to Scotland Yard to have a look at it and
try to guard it. It was John Dee's idea that some high level
magicians he was aware of in London would be able to either initiate
inquiries of the police or scan with their psychic eyes to assure
its protection. He provided me with several e-mail addresses.

"I had fortunately received your report of the Internet connection
at the Public Library, knowledge I must confess I never thought I'd
have a practical use for. I hope you don't mind that I made use of
your account."

Despite my internal agitation, I was able to send her a mental
smile. "No trouble at all. I'm glad my report was complete, password
and all."

"Many thanks for that. Anyway, I went at once to the library, and
fortunately was able to find a terminal there that was not being
used. This planet's Internet is hardly the High Forest, but still I
was quickly in touch with a couple of the British magicians Dee had
told us about. They instantly acted on the warning. They, being
native to this planet, could do all the magic they wished, without
unduly alerting the entities Dee was worried about. The British
magicians got back to me after barely twenty minutes. They had
quickly sent their astral bodies to the place Dee had said the
Talisman of Yam Nahar was kept. They said it had indeed been there,
but we were just too late. There was nothing in the box but the
psychic impression that had they arrived even an hour earlier, they
would have found it."

"Okay you two," I projected, "just what is this thing? You speak of
it as if it had the might of one of our rings. Just how powerful is
it? Blue, I don't think I'm reading you wrong in feeling this is
almost as bad as a nuclear war."

"Well," she replied, "we were just talking about the Talisman of
Yattashdor."

"You can't mean it's as powerful as that?" I asked. I mentally
looked from Blue to Orange, waiting for one of them to say that of
course it wasn't." When this denial didn't come instantly I braced
myself and a feeling akin to awe descended upon me.

I gave a mental chuckle. "I'm supposed to be investigating the
magical potential of this planet and it has items of such magical
potency on it without me even being aware of them."

"We wouldn't have known either," projected Blue, "if it hadn't been
for the spirit of John Dee and just maybe we'll be able to get it
back, whereas had we proceeded in blissful ignorance, the liklihood
for great harm would be far higher. It is as powerful as the
Talisman of Yattashdor," she continued very soberly. "And it was
made for evil as the Talisman of Yattashdor was made for good. It is
said that it was conceived and created by means of the most dark and
potent spells by Zandala just before his death."

I gave a mental start. "That's very disturbing," I projected. "I had
occasion to encounter that vile name just before I got here. Just a
few hours ago someone was asking at your friendly neighbourhood
magic store for Zandala's grimoire."

"They were asking for that!" projected Orange, mentally carving a
sign of light to ward off any unwholesome influence from those
mental syllables. "Ay-yar help the people of this planet, if that's
here, too."

"There's more," I projected. "There's a coin or whatever it really
is. I guess there's a good chance it's the missing Talisman of Yam
Nahar." I filled them in about the entire incident at the bookstore.

"I don't understand," Orange pondered, "what these offworld
artifacts are doing here. This is a planet bound culture. How did
they get here?"

I gave a mental shrug. "I don't know whether Blue has anything
specific. This place, though, has a very long history of belief in
higher civilizations having existed in the past. Plato lived almost
two thousand five hundred years ago and he wrote about the lost
continent of Atlantis. One of the old second hand books I picked up
is called LOST CONTINENTS. This is an examination written around
1960 of the very large number of individuals and groups who have
accepted Plato's postulated continent or others, such as the one
that was supposed to exist in the Pacific, and which is known as
Lemuria or Mu. A number of people feel that twenty thousand or more
years ago there was a higher civilization here than there is now.
Offworld contact could have occurred at that time. An even larger
number believe that there is significant extraterrestrial contact
taking place at the present time."

"Undoubtedly correct," came Blue's thoughtful smile. "It was the
report of the Thalian scout and the request of the Federation
Council that got us involved here."

"One scout ship," projected Orange, "and one, well, three now,
wizards, and we didn't bring evil grimoires and talismans along with
us."

"The universe is a big place," she replied. "Just because the
Federation has no record of previous visits is no proof they haven't
taken place."

"Do you have anything else," I thought to her, "either from Dee or
his magicians?"

"No," she replied. "I can ask them when I'm back on the Internet.
Whatever their personal beliefs on the matter, I don't expect
anything more than theory. Red, no doubt, will be very interested.
You know how he has the whole unconscious mapped out, and perhaps
correctly attributes to it most of the supramundane intelligences
whom our magicians believe they can contact."

"Right on," I projected. "We'll have a hard time ascertaining that
these Terran magicians have been in touch with anything other than
different segments of their own minds, even if they swear they've
been talking to aliens. Yet, the demon those sorcerers came up with,
and the entity asking after Zandala's grimoire cannot be dismissed
so easily."

"Yes," agreed Orange. "Why don't we wrap this up. We'll send a
complete mental record of our discussion here to those back home.
Then we better prepare to face anything."

"What about Dee's suggestion that we avoid the open use of magic
here?" I asked. "Should we continue that, and, if so, up to what
point?"

There was a brief fraction of a second of mental silence, though at
the speed of thought, this seemed like a fairly long lull in the
discussion. Each of us was letting his own thoughts range quickly
over the information, which had been exchanged and was weighing the
options. By the end of that time the three of us were mentally
nodding. We had agreed, which was often what happened, when we met
in telepathic meetings.

There was no need to state that agreement formally. Each of us could
see it in the minds of the others. Orange was thinking about the
various details and complexities involved. Blue and I followed his
thoughts carefully. We obviously were going to need magic to track
down the talisman and possibly the evil Grimoire of Zandala. Could
we do that using only magic native to this planet?

I considered that doubtful. Suddenly the image of Kevin popped into
my head. I tried to shake that aside. After all, Blue was already in
touch with the leading London magicians who had come with the
recommendations of John Dee. Even if the thing really was in Ottawa
would Kevin, despite his evident potential, be able to do anything
significant? He had only started studying magic within the last two
years, since his move from Nova Scotia. And I couldn't even be sure
the talisman wasn't back in London, if the coin really was the same
item and had really been here.

Orange and Blue noticed my thoughts. "Don't be so sure it's still
in London or gone back," Blue projected.

"And don't be too quick to underestimate Kevin," projected Orange.
"He could have quite a role to play in this before it's over."

At once, I heard a mental chirp. I recognized it as the call of the
gadara bird. Among the people of the island of Zih-han that call is
held to be the harbinger of great events. A curious mental calm
descended upon me, and it was with a sort of detachment that I
resumed our conversation. "Okay, if you agree, I'll contact him. He
promised to be home by six. We've got time to contact whomever is on
duty now..."

"Yellow will likely be the one. It was agreed she and I could be in
touch as you two have been, though not, I hope, for as long."

"Agreed," Blue and I projected together.

"After you contact Yellow," I resumed, "we can head out for the
Public Library, and, if you're up to it, we can continue on over to
Kevin's place."

"How far is that from here?" asked Orange.

"I'd say about three quarters of an hour by foot."

"All the way across town," he projected.

"Hardly," I returned. "This is a Terran city."

"Yes, cities as large as small forests," he projected in mock
complaint. "No doubt that's the reason they wander around dressed
like forest rangers, backpacks and all. Not really what I'd consider
in keeping with the dignified bearing of this aged sage." He
projected a picture of himself, wrinkled and with a long beard,
garbed in ranger blue, and leaping with a backpack flapping on his
back out of the way of Terran cars as they raced down forest trails.

"Come on, Orange," I projected along with my mental laugh. "You're
the youngest one in the room."

Blue joined in the laugh. "Orange, I think you make a fine forest
ranger."

"I didn't have the impression from your reports, Green, that forty
minute walks were the norm here," Orange projected, becoming
serious again.

"Many of the locals would consider that too far for them," I
replied, "though there's a lot of students, like us, who consider it
quite normal."

Blue beamed another telepathic smile at me. "Green, I'm looking
forward to this walk. I think this great city is fascinating. I'm
glad we'll get a chance to stroll through as much of it as we do."

"Me too," I projected. "Also, it's probably a good idea to go now to
avoid a long lineup for the library's Internet terminals. The sooner
we get to the library, the better chance we have of getting a
terminal before the really rushed evening hours. Many people won't
yet have finished work and supper."

"So," projected Blue, "fasting is one way for some students to
stroll through Terra's finger version of the High Forest."

"Blue," I replied, "I'm happy to invite you to a typical Terran
student's supper, after we do what has to be done."

"I'm looking forward to it," she projected.

"I'm going to contact Yellow now," came Orange's thought. Blue and I
became silent, as Orange reached deeper to project the message
through interstellar space. We could see the words and visuals as
they appeared in his mind. First, there came the image of the dark
yellow seashell rising from the sandy shore a hundred leagues west
of Awm. This was the larger than life sculpted covering of Yellow's
tower, patiently embellished with continuing carvings by successive
wizards of that colour.

Then, we could see her in his mind's eye, not within the tower, but
carefully walking along just inside the sea. The water rose two
fingers' length high from the soles of her feet. She was studying
the vegetation rising from the seabed and the exquisite harpflies
nesting there.

"Yellow," called Orange softly.

"Orange, what's wrong? Delighted as I am to receive your thoughts,
you're two hours early."

"I'm okay. We've got in touch with Green and just finished a fairly
comprehensive briefing. Are you ready for a tight beam of what we've
learned here so far?"

"Send," she projected.

We felt the tight pulse sent and could perceive Orange's awareness
of Yellow's studious expression as its contents began to enter her
consciousness.

"I'll relay this to the other members of the Council," she
projected. "Orange, you come back to me safe and sound. Give my
greetings and the same message to Green and Blue."

"I will. Till we stand again on the same shore, I'm yearning."

"Till then, Orange, I'm waiting."

Then, the telepathic link faded and Orange was fully present in the
room with us. He beamed a psychic smile at us. "You read her
greeting in my mind. She'll let the others know." I felt his empathy
for Blue and I separated for more than two months.

"Now," projected Blue, "we can set out for the library."

"Let me call Kevin first," I urged. "Just in case we get delayed. He
won't be there now, but I can leave a message on his answering
machine. He promised to be home by six. He's also thinking of going
over to Ottawa University later to try the library there. He may not
wait for us, if we don't get in touch by the time he expects."

"Fine," projected Orange.

Had our lengthy consultation been conducted verbally, it probably
would have taken perhaps an hour or two. Had we simply exchanged
data at maximum telepathic speed, it would have lasted barely a
second. Since we had done this as a leisurely telepathic discussion,
it lasted long enough for us to conduct a few overt verbal exchanges
on the topic of chess. We never had time to get to Blue's lyrical
descriptions of the pleasures and benefits of role playing games.

I had not forgotten that someone might be observing us. I raised a
finger and said out loud, "Good point. By the way, I just remembered
something I forgot to check with Kevin. Where's your phone?"

"Just over here," Orange said.

I went to the phone he indicated and tapped the number, which I had
memorized. It rang and then rang again. Then there was a click and I
could hear Kevin's voice reciting: "Greetings. Thank you for
arriving at my abode, even if only in a virtual sense. I'm virtually
here myself, which I suspect is not satisfying you. Why not leave
your name and number and any message you may wish, and I'll get back
to you as soon as possible."

The beep sounded almost at once. "Greetings, yourself," I said. "You
know who I am. I've been visiting my good friend Mr. Orange. I
mentioned to him the question you raised with me earlier this
morning, and he's a bit interested in meeting you. We're planning on
dropping over as soon as possible. We hope to be there no later than
six. We would appreciate it if you'd wait for us, just in case we
get delayed on the way over. The number here is... Kevin, I doubt
I'll be home for the next few days, so there's no point leaving a
message for me there. Take care."

I hung up and walked back to my seat. "It was only an answering
machine," I said out loud.

"Now," said Blue, "how about letting me show you something cool I
found at the library."

"Good idea," said Orange. "Let me turn off the CD player and get
my jacket."

Blue threw on her jacket and tossed her backpack over her right
shoulder. I wasn't wearing a jacket, so I simply threw my own
backpack over my shoulders and followed the others outside.
