This summary was prepared by Michael McKenny for his personal study. So, if he was not necessarily always precise in placing quotation marks around some places where he is quoting Walter L. Dorn, this is due to his thinking that the entire summary, apart from WilliamL Langer's introduction, is of the author's words.

. (ix-x)  Introduction by William L. Langer: Standard intro for the series followed by specific for this volume: This period has two great wars, but Professor Dorn, rather than give them two detailed a treatment, examines the dynamics of the Eighteenth Century state and covers well the intellectual, artistic, etc. currents of those years.

(xi-xii) Preface by Walter L. Dorn: Painful excissions include Scandinavia and the Ottoman Empire, as well as the topic of enlightened despotism. There remains discussion of the functioning of the competitive state system and the Enlightenment.

I i. (1-3) The Balance of Power System: In 1740 Europe was calm, though a highly competitive attitude held sway amongst its component states. A balance of power helped preserve the peace. Europeans, abiding within different independent states and speaking a variety of languages, were conscious of being one people. Europe's great powers applied balance of power only to themselves, not to lesser states.
ii. (3-12) Social Structure and Politics: European states had classes. Aristocrats controlled policy. Kings ruled for and by the pleasure of aristocrats. Aristocrats were warriors. Peasants, cratsmen, even bourgeois, lacked political inluence. Money was required to fight. Prudent kings supported business interests. English aristocrats largely were middle class. England lacked a warrior class. Believing in limited markets, England and France fought for their greater share. Continental powers drew armies from their lands and sought to expand these. In theory, continental kings had power and were the centers of intrigues by those seeking influence, while in England Parliament had power and kings intrigued. Peasants supported powerful monarchs, who could restrain capricious aristocrats.
iii. (12-16) War and Progress: Recent historians, reacting against previous emphasis on militarism, focus heavily on peaceful elements of national progress. However, the military did play a substantial role in the structure of evolving European nations: controlling internal dissent, defending from external threats, enabling territorial expansion and influencing to a great extent economics and taxation. The traits of the professional army (punctuality, discipline, precision, etc.) influenced wider culture, including capitalist business, especially in factories. Supplying large armies consumed considerable resources and greatly impacted taxation and the economy, including agriculture and ship building.

II i. (17-23) Feudal Versus Bureaucratic Officialism: Across Europe administration increased. There are parallels in all countries. Frederick the Great was the only true autocrat. All other rulers had a bureaucracy. Also, feudal aspects continued. Centralization proceeded, with some exceptions, e.g. Bohemia, Humgary, Ukraine and the Baltics. Also, the Estates were strong in Hungary, Poland and Sweden.Selling offices weakened rulers. Officials were now efficient and accountable. Kings saw themselves as laboring for their people. Bureaucracy expanded state control over the details of life.
ii. (23-35) France: France's king's theoretical absolute power actually encountered judicial insistence on a required form of registrating decrees. Louis was unassertive. France felt heavily conflicting intrigues. Banking interests were powerful. Parliaments were strong, sometimes passing laws beyond their jurisdiction. Enforcement was problematic. Selling offices led to a large number of offices. Administrators were selected from magistrates, giving them a sense of independence. Higher administrators were wealthy, not telying on their salaries for their livlihood. Despite the theoretical primacy of the royal council, six ministers (justice, finance, war, navy, external and royal household) conducted much of the business. Their letters did not require registration. Provincial and local governance was by intendants and much more stable than the central administration. Intendants often provided a human, reasonable face to the realm's relationship to its people. Intendants applied Roman law, assessing private vested interests as lesser than the public good. They employed experts in canals, roads, medicine, etc. and even opened technical schools to train engineers, etc. A significant flaw in France's administration was a farfrom exact accounting procedure, with books frpm previous years remaining open. 
iii. (35-42) Spain: Bourbons brought a new spirit to Spain, energizing it above previous indecision.The Catholic Church continued to exert influence; King Ferdinand VI had a Jesuit confessor conveying the order's advice. Spain's economy remained feudal; money making and wealth lacked the esteem these had in England. Spaniards preferred joint to individual responsibility. Six ministers (external, justice, navy, Indies, war and finance) exercised administrative control. These could work at cross purposesFrom 1743 to 1754 Ensenada controlled four ministries, including finance. He made progress, even balancing the budget briefly. The Council of Castile was central, considering matters great and small. Two councils and viceroys (Mexico and Peru) administered Spanish America. They were effectively managed for military defense of the colonies. An attempt to transplant the French institution of the intendant to Spain was not very successfel.
iv. (42-52) The Hapsburg Monarchy: Hapsburg measures to weld their disparate domains into one centralized state had not succeeded. Maria Theresa and advisors Haugwitz and Kaunitz accomplished this. She entrusted Haugwitz with reorganizing Hapsburg administration. He created a local, provincial and central administration inspired by Prussia's. The five departments (external, commerce, justice, war and internal)  were topic focused. The council of state offerred advice often followed. A state wide supreme court was established. Provincial administration was enhanced, reducing the estates' power. The Bohemians, having just been pardoned for backing Charles Albert, could hardly complain. They also lacked the military value of their Prussian counterparts. Hapsburg district officers, protecting peasants' paying capacity, clashed with nobles and monasteries. Maria Theresa now conducted more Hungarian matters in Vienna, Hungary's new capital. She attracted Hungarian nobles to state service, appointing some ambassadors, generals, etc. She founded the Order of St. Stephen.
v. (52-62) Prussia: Prussia, through supreme organization and social discipline, accomplished the wonder of transforming from a disparate state to a great power. Prussia, uniquely among great European states, balanced its budget. Frederick alone came into daily contact with all government agencies. He alone made policy. He corresponded with his efficient bureaucracy only in writing. He applied himself to his work undisturbed by family, religion, etc.  He had agents observing his appointed by merit bureaucrats. Each candidate for office spent one to two years on a royal farm. Prussian civil servants had the respect of their people. Frederick consulted directly with provincial officials, who provided him revenue and effective agriculture, etc. There were two kinds of local officials, commisary visiting six to ten towns and landrat. Commisary set local budgets, food prices, etc. and ensured freedom of religion, adequate medical care, etc. The landrat, a noble, provided police services, etc. Prussia's bureaucracy's most brilliant achievement was managing its public finances, enabling Frederick to wage three wars without significant debt. Prussians, in general relatively poor, but disciplined achieved this. 
vi. (62-70) Russia: Under Elizabeth Russian nobles became more European. Moscovy had been a service state. Peter the Great made all nobles' land hereditary, while retaining nobles' military or administrative duty. Elizabeth lightened the duty. Peter III removed it. Peter the Great founded a Baltic capital and began systematic application of mercantilism and Western trade. While predominantly agricultural, Russia had some early large scale industry. Peter the Great's efforts to establish Western bureaucracy failed. Elizabeth assigned much responsibility to Peter Shuvalov. In 1754 he removed internal tariffs, stimulating trade. Lower officials were more feudal. Despite five hundred secret investigators, a considerable amount of tax money raised never reached the treasury. 
vii. (70-79) EnglandL Insular England had simple administration. Judges had power elsewhere given to officials. Individual rights were emphasized. England was a landed aristocracy. Education continued this. Ambitious merchants acquired land. Cabinet developed. George II disliked England preferring Hanover. He held to one party, the Whigs. George III was moew flexible. He also exerted greater personal control than had George II. Newcastle's large parliamentary majorities demonstrated his adept use of patronage. This was all that united Whigs. Tories then were largely literary, e.g. old nobility's Squire Weston and the Church's Dr. Johnson. The central government did not oversee county and local administration. This fostered self reliance at these levels. Hereditary and unpaid justices of the peace implemented parliament's laws. Sometimes, as in quarter sessions, these joined together. Single justices had considerable power. Parliament often heeded justices' advice.

III i. (80-84) Armies: Movement was relatively slow. Unproductive society members composed armies, officers from nobles, lower ranks from the unemployed. Service was enforced and discipline was strict. Scavaging was forbidden, for fear of mass desertion. Mobility was limited by the distance the army could be supplied. Armies contained diverse nationalities, including many mercenaries. Soldiers were poorly regarded. They were of low quality. Some middle class officers appeared without improving overall officer quality. Russia had a national army, each landowner supplying one soldier for so many peasants.
ii. (85-90) The French Army: Marshal de Saxe was France's sole brillian general of this period. Bourgeois and noble officers clashed. The army was poorly funded. Prussia's army was more formidable than enemies of Louis Xiv's day. There was an over abundance of officers, many more often at Versailles than with the troops. Discipline suffered. France had brilliant military writers, including Maurice de Saxe. Voluntary enlistment was inadequate. France used mercenaries and militiamen. In 1745, conscription was introduced. Elite units were created to the detriment of the main force. Drill was not standardized. 
iii. (90-99) The Prussian Army: Prussia had a well armed, drilled and organized national army, commanded by Frederick the Great, the greatest general of his day, except perhaps Maurice de Saxe. As king, his commands could all be promptly obeyed, without need for higher approval. He considered good officers essential and drew on Prussia's landed nobility (Junkers) to obtain them. Officers faced a strict, studious existence, married to the army and seldom on leave. They were elite royal companions with precedence over all. Prussia's small population resulted in mercenaries and press gangs. Soldiers were strictly disciplined and drilled. Desertion was high, imposing restriction on mobility, including pursuit of a fleeing enemy.
iv. (99-102) The Dilemma of the Anti-Militarists in England and on the Continent: England bourgeois considered its navy adequate for defence and armies a means to despotism. The militia Parliament established was of poor military quality. Soldiers, their numbers annually set by Parliament, garrisoned colonies and combatted smuggling. French philosophers preferred a citizen militia to a standing army to avoid despotism. 
v. (102-108) Navies and Sea Power: Seafaring nations with merchant fleets were the naval powers. These were: England, France, Spain and Holland, this last in decline. Trading posts became colonial settlements, provisioning ships and requiring protection. England first departed from seasonal naval presence in colonial waters by permanently stationing ships in the West Indies. England and France were the two great naval rivals. England was significantly superior, though not in shipbuilding. Navies deteriorated in peace time. Commercial interests significantly determined naval actions. Many merchant vessels sailed in convoys.
vi. (108-114) British Naval Officers and Crews: British naval officers often began as captain's servants 13 to 16 years old. Captains chose midshipmen, who after six years and a passed exam became lieutenants. Influence generally decided captains. Officers were young and experienced. The Admiralty lacked a good grasp of strategy. England began to apply blockades more effectively. England could not afford wartime naval strength in peacetime. Sailors seldom volunteering, meanr there were press gangs. Sailors were paid little and late. Diseases, including scurvey, took a high toll.
vii. (114-121) The French Navy: France, unlike England, could not focus primarily on her navy. France had considerable overseas commercial interests, some of it carried on foreign ships. French merchant ships lached full naval protection. The French naval minister urged a strong navy as essential in confronting a naval power and even as a deterrant to war. French naval officers were perhaps better educated than English ones, but lacked their experience at sea. France had naval conscription, though inadequate for wartime. France used press gangs, though these also impressed peasants who had no experience at sea. French authorities considered sea battles inconclusive, preferring privateers damaging enemies' commerce. While England's commerce was damaged, England's surviving navy enabled quick recovery.

IV (122) Continental dynastic struggle and the clash of colonial empires occurred overlapping, intermingled and interconnected.
i. (122-130) The Anglo-Spanish War: Spain's colonial expanse was so vast, its colonists' needs and wants exceeded her capacity. Tarifs to satisfy the imperial budget encouraged contraband. Spain's attempts to control imports and British merchants seeking new markets led to war. Some wanted conquest. Some, including British sugar interests, were not so keen. England's attack on Cartagena failed. The Dutch stayed neutral.French diplomacy gained support for France and denied it to England. France sent ships to the West Indies.
ii. (130-134) The Austrian Succession: Hapsburg possessions were scattered, even core territories connected only by personal rulership. Minority Germans dominated, drawing on Germany for military, etc. strength. The German crown had symbolic merit, even after it had lost much actual power. The various parts of the Empire lacked cohesion. Charles VI named Maria Theresa his successor, leaving her little military, etc. support. She was charming and devout, but only twenty three and without astute advisors. Initially she was widely accepted.
iii. (134-141) The Prussian Invasion of Silesia: Prussia rose. Frederick II became ruler in 1740. He was 28 years old. He considered the state his priority. He seized Silesia, disregarding advice against this rash act. He considered Silesia essential and offerred Maria Theresa compensation. She refused to accept. The Prussian army was successful, prompting others to advance claims to Austrian territories.
iv. (141-147) Belle Isle and the Continental Coalition: France's Fleury failed to convince the French nobility that traditional anti Austrian policy was no longer in France's best interest. Belle Isle's intrigues forced war. French invaders prompted Maria Theresa to appeal to her Hungarians. Although previously belittled, they responded to the charming, wronged woman. The price was her acceptance of the independence of the Hungarian realm. Belle Isle did not follow Frederick's advice to swiftly attack Vienna. Under English pressure, Austria accepted Frederick's possession of Silesia. France withdrew. Austria took Bavaria. Maria Theresa pursued the French.
v. (147-153) British Intervention and its Consequences: A succession of British cabinets faced internal discord, divided between advocates of a strong land and a strong sea policy. George II's Hanoverian roots caused English distrust. Walpole was not the one to organize a strong continental effort. Carteret replaced Walpole in early 1742. He failed to justify his continental policy to cabinet. His general (Cumberland was inferior to France's Marshal de Saxe. Carteret failed to grasp German complexities. 
vi. (153-158) The Italian War: Spain's Queen Elizabeth Farneses placed her eldest son, Don Carlos, on the throne of the Two Sicilies and sought Milan and Tuscany for her second son, Don Philip. Sardinia's Charles Emmanuel was courted by Austria and Spain. He helped beat off Spanish forces. England pressured Austria to give him much of Lombardy. This provoked Genoa, France and Prussia. Frederick invaded Bohemia, reaching close to Vienna. When Louis XV's illness kept France from engaging Austria, Frederick, keen and agile in adversity, extracted his forces. Pressed hard, Frederick demonstrated his military acumen with victories over Austria. Then, with his resources, depleted, Frederick ceased helping France.
vii. (158-164) D'Argenson and the End of the Continental War: D'Argenson, France's new minister, wanted peace. England's new minister, Pelham, was somewhat agreeable. D'Argenson was idealistic, envisioning far reaching solutions, for example, an Italian federation. This cost Sardinia's support and and frustrated Spain's hopes. In the Netherlands, Marshal de saxe scored brilliant victories. Scotland's Prince Charles led a rising against England. He failed, though his distraction helped de Saxe.win his resplendent victories. D'Argenson wished to negotiate with the Dutch, but Louis XV and De Saxe preferred a military resolution. The Dutch elected William of Orange, William IV. A top military commander, Holland was financially exhausted. 
viii. ((164-173) Thr War on Commerce: Preoccupied on the Continent, England poorly attended to America. Colonists helped take Louisburg. France captured Madras in India. French efforts to retake Louisburg failed. France took Mauritius. British attempts in India were unsuccessful. More serious were the predations of provateers, though their severity has been overstated. The French suffered more. England's blockade of France was highly effective, inclining France to peace. The threat of England's bankruptcy had similar results. 
ix. (174-177) The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle: The Peace largely restored territories lost: Madras to England, Louisburg to France. Frederick received Silesia, significantly weakening Austria. England had lost two traditional allies: Holland and Austria. The old system had failed as William Pitt and Count Kaunitz realized. 

V i. (178-187) Its Social Milieu: The Leviathan state had enlightened and actie administrators. Yet, absolute monarchy at its head threatened its vigor and adaptability. Fresh currents of thought eroded tradition and remade the foundations of Western Civilization. There were diverse trends and individuals. There was reason and also sensibility and pre-romanticism, philosophes and founders of mystical movements. The Enlightment dissolved the unity of the religious and intellectual system preailing since the Fifth Century. The Enlightenment appealed to the autonomy of human reason, the belief in perfectability and progress, the confidence in causality uncovering principles governing man, nature and society. Modern critical judgement on the Enlightenment fluctuates. There is gratitude for its heroic effort to free humanity from fetters of authority and tradition. The source of the Enlightenment is often traced  to Seventeenth Century England, especially Locke, Shaftesbury and Newton. In Germany mentioned are Liebnitz, Thomasius and Christian Wolf. Only in the last third of the Century did German thought achiee full maturity with Lessing, Goethe and Herder. In England only deism and Daid Hume were significant in this period. France was intellectually supreme, its philosophical influence emerging rom its linguistic and cultural influence in general. The salon was the setting for cultural and literary conversations, though this was often relatively shallow. Though the philosophers spoke of striving for humanity,  they and the Enlightment  were largely middle class bourgeoisie striving for liberty of commerce and freedom from state regulation. Economic prosperity enriched the middle classes and boosted their self confidence. New inventions appeared in England. Every type of modern trading association was known. France also saw adances in science and technology. . Its road transport and port systems, its technical education, etc. improved. Traditional and legal restraints were inadequate to block ascending capitalists, whose use of interests (usury) violated religious morality, leading them to sever their concept of ethics from the Church's. Publishing transitioned from patronage to the modern reader supported system. In France, strict conformity to Counter-Reformation creed and standards forced alternative thought, especially criticism, to appear anonymously and abroad. Despite suppression philosophcal ideas spread. France's unity, in contrast to Germany's disunity, helped propel scientific and technological advance.
ii. (188-193) The Intellectual Setting: Descartes' logical rationalism, French Classical prose and natural science led to the Enlightenment. Newton in his law of gravitation had discovered a natural, a fundamental cosmic law. Henceforth, scientists could depend on obseration, experiment, measurement and calculation. Maupertus and Voltaire spread Newton's ideas widely in France. French science, aided by the microscope, pursued biological and psychological questions. Buffon, ignoring the Bible and considering fossils, pushed back geological time. Linnaeus (1707-1778) introduced his system of biological classification. Natural laws indicated human inclusion with other animals. Rational thought brought contending religious groups to higher Biblical criticism. Disputes, internal and international, fostered historical studies and the writing of national histories. Economics attracted philosophical attention to mineral resources, commerce and agriculture. Europe was inluenced by its interaction with the wider world, from noble savages to the highhly refined Chinese. By 1750 the social scientists were examining institutions and societies. The Enlightenment gave them the concepts to perceive their order and harmony.
iii. (193-198) Its Methods: The philosophers felt themselves on the crest of a new wave in European civilization. They sought to understand its origins and direction, and to guide it beneficially. "Reason" vitalized it. This was reason based on observation and analysis, not in the possession, but in the acquisition of truth. The philosophers then did not distinguish between the natural and the social sciences. Condillac traced perception, memory, idea, imagination, judgement and knowledge to sensations or revived sensations. Many then accepted historical and sociological determinism, that the state could be decomposed. Many today criticize their inexact analysis and the facile remarks prompted by salon conversation. Condillac and Montesque did seek constant and universal characteristics. They and D'Alambert recognized truth's relativity, that each solution was a point of departure for further exploration. The philosophes were not a break from, but a development of, Seventeenth Century philosophy.
iv. (198-214) The Enlightenment and Religion: The Enlightenment compelled established Churches to adapt, to turn from physical coercion to moral suasion, to accept religious diversity and freedom of expression. It advanced appreciation for intellectual honesty, individual initiative and dissent. In France, Spain and Austria Churck and State were keenly linked. There intolerance and physical compulsion were prevalent. The Church's dogmatic sphere included science. Philosophers sought scientific enquiry and rational analysis. They were keenly interested in science on its own, independent of the Bible and theology. Buffon's geology first achieved the Church's acceptance of science's independence. Philosophers saw religion as an impediment to progress. There were French materialists, determinists challenging both God and human will power. Diderot was a determinist, but one who believed in man's potential for good. Diderot was humanistic, secular, modern and scientific. In England, many educated people were deists, conceiving of God as rational, reliable, wise and benificent. They studied all the great religions for common elements, for a universal, natural religion that could unite humanity. David Hume, the radical sceptic, opposed them, asserting study of human nature disclosed not unity, but discordant and chaotic impulses. Hume rejected natural religion and the rational foundation of the entire Enlightenment. Voltaire stood between the deists and Hume. Voltaire articulated enlightenment, justice, tolerance and intellectual freedom. Others had satirized religion, but none with his imagination and literary genius. Voltaire accepted the oneness and brotherhood of man and deism's universal morality. Voltaire was the greatest humanist of the French Enlightenment, a cosmopolitan in the best sense. Here we reach a key point of the Enlightenment, its passionate desire to humanize religion. The Enlightenment was a resumption and development of the humanistic theology of the Renaissance. Pascal, with analytical reason, sought to prove original sin and the necessity of faith. Voltaire, while satirizing Pascal the misanthrope, faced Pascal's argument re the existence of evil. Voltaire rejected Pascal's way of certitude, happy to live with scepticism and doubt. Rousseau asserted the natural goodness of man, holding that human degeneration (evil) resulted from depraved society.
v. (214-221) History: The Enlightenment popularized history, enriching its content and extending its scope. Voltaire, Hume and Gibbon produced impressive histories. Classical literature had been intently studied. Substantial medieal material had been published. Pierre Bayle demonstrated historical criticism. Enlightenment historians presented human civilization, the spirit of the age, the national spirit. Voltaire perceived European civilization, evidenced by the republic of scholars. He viewed reason emerging in human activities. He was impatient and did not carefully analyze the history he surveyed. Enlightenment thinkers produced impressive historical studies, emphasizing the universals of humanity. Hume was an exception. He seemed more aware of process and change. He focused on facts and avoided broad generalizations.
vi. (221-236) Social Science and Political Thought: The philosophers saw themselves as restorers. Their social science aimed at understanding the evils of contemporary society and ascertaining realistic remedies. Montesquieu, a monarchist in his 1748 Esprit des Lois sought restitution of France's ancient constitution. His work is the first modern study in ideal sociological patterns. The Encyclopedia began to appear in 1751. It did much to deelop the idea of progress. The physiocrats were founded by Francois Quesnay. They asserted the primacy of agriculture and the existence of natural economic laws. They sought scientifically to better humanity, to understand wealth's creation and extend it to the greatest number. As the philosophers, their viewpoint was global. They opposed international conflict. Quesnay began with observational facts, carefully studied, of France's agriculture. He always retained his practical, utilitarian reformist outlook. Physiocrats considered agriculture primary and essential. They articulated the rights of landowners and decried state preferrence of businessmen. Quesnay held that reason must ascertain and uphold society's natural laws. Rousseau was the radical, calling for a moral reformation and societal revival. There remain intense differences of understanding concerning his writings. His life was quixotic. The strict social order stirred in him a yearning for freedom. He urged a return to a simple, honest, sincere state of nature that he realized may never have actually existed. He proclaimed need for an all powerful state. He asserted the unity of his thought, denied that he opposed civilization and said that he merely wished the return of a simple, honest virtue. He defined freedom as voluntary consent to state law, a decision to be a citizen. He felt that reason and science were not a threat, if they were founded on morality, a moral law that applied equally to all. Previously, physical necessity had driven man from primeval simplicity. Society had been imposed, a society that was a field for conflicting ambitions. Now an application of basic morality was required.
vii. (236-245) The Emotional Revival: French art and literature had lost some of their freshness and vigor. Artifice was also widespread in salon conversation. There was yearning for more emotional sincerity in life, literature and art across Europe. In Germany, religious stirrings prompted a move from speaking French to the more authentic German. Count von Zinzendorf and his Moravian Brethren sought religious tolerance and personal religious experience. Similar was England's John Wesley's Methodism, which spread widely. Wesley was a good organizer. He travelled and preached much, influencing a great many people. Methodism provided sincere religious emotion. Emotional lyricism had reached English literature. A new sympathy arose for things medieval. The Age saw the emergence of the modern English novel. Especially significant was Samuel Richardson resonating across the Continent. Rousseau crystallized the new sentimentality. He not only described it, he lived it.
viii. (245-250( Art: French art reigned supreme. France produced many artists and Diderot a keen critic. Boucher was a good representatie of the gallant taste of the age. Diderot considered Boucher decadent and loked Greuze. Chardin became the age's greatest painter, one who greatly impressed Frederick the Great. England's William Hogarth, who first discovered mass production, sold hundreds of engraings of a painting.

(251-252) Mercantilism and the old colonial system were fading. England and France were the two great colonial powers. They faced each other in North America, the West Indies, Africa and India, contending for slaves, sugar, tobacco and indico.
Vi i. (252-257) Colonies and National Economy: The colonies had become integral parts of both English and French economies. French ports rapidly grew and colonial products, e.g. sugar, arried no longer luxuries. Sugar refining was now a major French industry. Much colonial import was exported to Eastern Europe, the Leant and the Baltic.French population exceeded England's: twenty-three millions to six and a half. England faced the land enclosure process. Colonial trade boosted England's economy, helping to enrich some merchants. England was better positioned for imperialism with her more mobile population, more open and unrestricted trade. Large scale production already existed in some industries, e.g. textiles and metals. The Bank of Englsnd set the pace of banking. Credit, including back credit, stimulated British industry and trade.
ii. (257-268) The French and British Imperial Systems: French imperialism was a state affair, a mercantilest endeavour; British imperialism was more an expansion of British society to escape state control. France appointed a civilian and a military administrator of each colony, both under strict central control. The Ministry of the Marine ran the colies as if they were ships. That central planning scared away potential investors. The prevailing mercantilist attitude saw value in colonies only to the extent that they could enhance the national diet and be economically viable. This explains the disdain for Canada and the preference for much smaller islands in the West Indies. Both England and France manned large colonial plantations, with African slaves. This slave labour was considered economically essential, and attacks on slavery on etical grounds were resisted on economic grounds. Mercantilist colonial policy prioritized colonial trade and favoured vested interests. Colonies were treated as branch plants of the motherland and moves towards colonial economic self sufficiancy keenly opposed. The system broke down when the motherland could not supply colonists, or could not do so as cheaply as foreigners. Smuggling was rampant. People at the time thought that the system worked, that trade flourished and that colonies were a major factor in that flourishing trade and general economic prosperity.
iii. (268-273) The West Indies: The West Indies were pivotal in the competition between England and France. French islands with better soils were more productive. There was substantial illegal trade between French islands and British continental colonies. British islands had problems. Many small white farmers were in debt. Only Jamaica had more capacity for increased cultivation. The higher price of sugar and molasses from British islands led colonists in North America to buy smuggled French product. The British were more successful in controlling African trade. They had fourteen forts on the Gold Coast The French moved further south and their trade in slaves reached highest levels.
iv. (273-281) India: India was not integral to the British or to the French. India received much New World bullion in exchange for cottons and calicoes. In Bengal both British and French were strictly supervised. In the south, Dupleix exerted aggressive force, spending his own money, exercising a protectorate over native rulers and collecting revenue from them. Paris, king included, did not supprt his policy. England intervened. Britain's commanders, Robert Clive and Stringer Lawrence, were of superior ability. Bussy, Dupleix's best subordinate, held the Deccan, but then could not help in the south. British success's led to Dupleix's recall. .
v. (281-291: North America and the Outbreak of the War: French occupation of the waterways of the St. Lawrence, the Great Lakes and the Mississippi indicated her military and absolutist tradition. Every habitant fifteen to sixty years old was in the militia. Effective French settlement was a narrow corridor from Montreal to Quebec City (population 65,000). Canada was a financial liability. The fur trade was unreliable. The Catholic Church was dominant. Agriculture was primitive.  French colonists had respect and loyalty to the motherland; British colonists resented English interference. British colonists were thrusting west. The two colonial powers clashed in the Ohio River Valley. Virginia's governor  called for England's assistance. France and England preferred peace. More pacific British leaders were not well informed on colonial affairs and easily influenced by those wanting war. England sent an expedition. France matched it.  England captured Fort Beausejour in Nova Scotia, England began seizing French ships. France denounced the pirace and demanded their return. France planned a direct attack against London with diversions to Halifax and Minorca. London held, Minoorca fell. Englanl declared war on May 18, 1756, though they had been fighting for two years. 

VII (292): Changes in alliances indicate a weakening of French influence, the rise of Russia and the cunning of Austria's Kaunitz.
i. (292-295): The British Initiative:Although traditional ties connecting France with Prussia, Denmark, Sweden and Turkey and England with Holland and Austria seemed set, things were stirring. Newcastle poorly understood continental matters. He believed that England could buy anything. He retained initiative in the face of French inactivity. England focused diplomacy on Hanover and Holland, seeking continued Austrian assistance, but refusing Austrian requests to join with Russia in destroying Prussia. England turned to Russia, a substantial trading partner, signing a treaty on September 30, 1755.
ii. (296-300) Count Kaunitz's Grand Design: Austria's Kaunitz, an ideal Enlightenment diplomat, believing he had completely calculated contigencies, convinced France to join against Prussia. He also convinced pious Maria Theresa, despite his impiety. Aware of the impace of Prussia's rise, he envisaged the enticements to each potential destroyer of Prussia, himself willing to cede the indefesible Netherlands. He offerred France various favours for financial assistance. He suggested Prussia was allied with England. Aware that French ministers were pro Prussian, Kaunitz had a letter from Maria Theresa directly given to Louis XV by Mme de Pompadour. Louis approved. His minister, understanding that Austria would not attack England, required proof. Prussia was allied with England.
iii. (300-306) Prussia and the Convention of Westminster: Despite the addition of Silesia, Prussia lacked the population and the geographical cohesion of a true great power. Frederick realized that adding Saxony, West Prussia and Pomerania would be ideal. He understood that the other great powers distrusted the suddenly risen Prussia. He knew that Russia's Elizabeth disliked him and that Russia would reasonably oppose any further Prussian gains. He felt his supperior army could  handle Russia and Austria, but not them in addition to a Western power. He saw France as an essential ally. France's remarkable restraint in face of English provocation convinced him that France was unreliable. He needed to ensure Prussia's security. There was no other reason, in his opinion, to either aid France or stand by in any Anglo-Franco conflict. He sought an alternative. Seeing England's financing of German states as a sign that England intended a continental war, he suggested that France seize Hanover and Flanders. France's refusal assured him that French policy was to avoid a continental war. Frederick signed the Convention of Westminster on January 16, 1756 to maintain peace in Germany. He would defend Hanover, which France had refused to attack. He felt Russia without British support would not attack him, nor would Austria without Russia. 
iv. (306-313) The Reversal of Alliances: Maria Theresa was shocked on learning that England had signed a treaty with her mortal enemy. France was upset less with the terms than with not having been consulted beforehand. France now distrusted Frederic. France, against her national interest, signed a defence treaty with Austria. Russia was upset. Russia insisted its troops only be used with Austrians against Prussia. Elizabeth was eager to attack Frederick. Kaunitz informed her of his French connection and restrained her attack fir a year. France moved closer to Kaunitz's design. Frederick struck first, invading Saxony. This strengthened the alliance against him. France readied a large aeny against Prussia, reversing her long standing anti-Austrian policy.
v. (313-317) Frederick the Great and the Origin of the War: Frederick, learning of plans to attack him in 1757, struck first. Asking Maria Theresa for assurances, he received none. Many warned him against attacking first, as waiting might find Austria unable to focus its allies. Military calculations led Frederick to attack Saxont before the alliance could assemble its forces. He offerred to withdraw on Austrian assurances. Maria Theresa refused.

VIII i. (318-325) The Strategy of Diversion: Attacked, Austria called on France and Russia. Prussia appealed to Eng;and. George II and Pitt hesitated. Hanover surrendered. Frederick failed to take Prague, was defeated by Russia, then attacked near Leipzig. Frederick won the Battles of Rossback and Leuthen. Frederick dazzled Europe gaining praise from the philosophers. England broke the Hanoverian peace and greatly strengthened that force commanded by one of Frederick's best generals. England funded Prussia. Hanover held off French armies.
ii. (325-342) Prussia's Struggle for Existence: Frederick's survival has long guaranteed speculation. Coalition errors were matched by Prussian mistakes. Frederick enjoyed interior lines. His opponents had difficulty co-ordinating their movements. Austria's Daun was slow and defensive. Frederick could move quickly and effectively. Frederick was often outnumbered. He maneuvered and exhausted his enemies. He balanced dashing offence with prudent defence. He faced combined forces at Kunersdorf(August 12,1759). His oblique attack technique succeeded partially, but the terrain proved too much for his exhausted troops. Russians fell back. Patriotism replaced his losses. He financed his needs from Silesia and by debasing his coinage. Frederick shared military hardships with his troops. He was resilient. As combined forces hesitated to attack him. Elizabeth died (January 5, 1762), saving him from complete defeat. 
iii. (342-350) The Dictatorship of William Pitt: England's rebuilt navy struck at France across the globe. Initially, France was successful in North America, etc. Admiral Byng was executed for losing Minorca, etc. Pitt and Newcastle formed a coalition government. Pitt enjoyed effective rule. He energized and directed a unified war effort. He was popular. He raised and sent large forces to North America, the West Indies and Africa. He carefully retained Spanish, Danish, Swedish and Dutch neutrality.
iv. (350-357) The Duke of Choiseul: France was divided. Louis XV's efforts to raise taxes to support the war were resisted. France had a navy and for three years reached her colonies. Montcalm landed with two thousand men in Canada. Foreign minister Bernice was pessimistic. His successor Choiseul was more determined. He engaged in ardent diplomacy. He failed to attract Spain. He dared a direct attack on England. It was delayed. England alerted prepared. French ports were blockaded. One fleet which slipped through was defeated near Lagos (August 19, 1759).
v. (357-369) The Colonial War: Canada: Pitt launched a massive three pronged attack against Louisburg, Canada and the Ohio Valley. There was strong popular support and victories. Numbers and scarce provisions told against the French. Montcalm was an ideal Eighteenth Cenrury French gentleman and officer. He had trouble with the governor general. Montcalm appealed to France for desperate aid. France did not respond. Quebec fell on September 13, 1759, Montreal on September 8, 1860. 
The West Indies: French privateers caused scarcity on British islands, prompting strong support for sction against French islands. Guadeloupe and Martinique fell. England took French trading posts in Africa. 
India: British naval superiority and Robert Clives 's acumen defeated France.
vi. (369-378) Between War and Peace: George II died on October 25, 1760. Pitt resisted George III's efforts to bring Bute into the Cabinet. George and Bute planned to remove Newcastle and Pitt. France's Choiseul offered peace. Choiseul and Pitt both wanted Canadian fishing. Spain supported France. France asked England to address Spanish issues. England refused. An Anglo-Spanish war erupted. England took Havana and Manila. Bute was now in control of England. He ended the alliance with Prussia. Then Russia's Elizabeth died. Peter III admired Frederick and ended hostilities against him. Peter III was assassinated. His wife, Catherine the Great, ascended the throne, uninterested in fighting for or against Frederick.
vii. (378-384) The Peace of Paris: The Peace of Paris was signed on February 10, 1763. France's Choiseul focused on his country's national interests, was able to accent the differences among England's politicians. He retained the heart of France's commercial empire. He began reorganization of the French navy. England's Bute failed to follow the prevailing attitude of retaining conquests, unless obtaining an appropriate sybstitute. England keenly discussed the advantages of Guadeloupe and the little value and heavy cost of continuing to hold captured Canada.  Yet, Canada, not Guadeloupe, became British. Elsewhere, Choiseul achieved France's advantage. Bute secured Parliament's approval. Spain accepted less favourable terms, On February 15, 1763, Prussia and Austria signed a separate peace.
