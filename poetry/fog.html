Just around the time I learned of traditional Irish 7 and 9 syllable
lines with two and three syllable ending words I wrote a poem about a
quite spectacular car "accident" on the 401 in southern Ontario, the
major highway in the country. I think it was sixty two cars involved
in the accident. At least seven were killed and dozens were taken to
hospital.

The amazing thing about it was that it was so unnecessary. People
crashed because they continued driving fast despite the fog which
deprived them of visibility. People nearby said it was terrible to
hear the crashing through the fog.

I wrote this poem on the day the "accident" happened. It will be
noticed that this poem has stanzas of regular line lengths. When I
wrote "Patricia and the Bear" a little later, I had been informed that
that 7 and 9 syllable thing was intended for the same poem.

Mourning a Foggy Morning

Ending with tears descending,
Rending minds beyond mending,
Warning of doom adorning,
Mourning a foggy morning.

Speeding from life receding,
Feeding tombs without needing,
Racing to graves embracing,
Chasing death, sightless pacing.

Searing the sights appearing,
Fearing the sounds we're hearing,
Blazing the flames amazing,
Gazing at wreckage dazing.

Deeming it ill-beseeming,
Teeming the fog with screaming,
Greening the lives careening,
Meaningless loss we're keening.

Michael McKenny, September 4, 1999
