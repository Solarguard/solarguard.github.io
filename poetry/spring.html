Spring

A quest for fire to hold at bay the night,
A grounding seed to gain a gift of grain,
A round of prayers for timely sun and rain,
Awesomely raising walls of urban might.
In shrines of glory, gods receive their right,
And shielding forces lead to clashing pain,
As meet the clansmen born in Babel's bane,
And Eve's garden became a place to fight.
With all we know before an age of ice,
And life today remains a frozen game,
Who'll light the torch to show the human face,
Who'll plant the seed for need beyond a price,
Who'll tell the brawling kids their Mommy's name,
So peaceful spring can reach the human race?
