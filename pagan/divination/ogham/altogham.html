The Ogham Dance by Michael McKenny

(The ogham reading that is described in this alternate history story is
one in which all three fews are considered as applying to the near
future, or at most for the coming year)

   "The game will now pause for the scheduled intermission."
   Bran smiled as he caught muttered complaints and even a loud, "Stupid
archaists." Gaul was ahead one to nothing, a fact which did not ease the
tempers of the Irish patrons of Saphonazar's most popular far viewing
mead hall, the Goblet and Lens.
   Bran took a sip of mead, moved a fidchell piece and looked up at the
big screen. He could see his father and his two older brothers, prominent
among the dignitaries. He spotted the other Celtic high kings and their
sons and the envoys from other lands. The ambassador from Ch'ang-an was
surely attired in robes as splendid as Liu Pei's own.
   Then the camera shifted and Alana in a simple green cloak and a
verdant headband was looking at him, or rather not looking at him. She
was holding her eyes tightly shut.
   "Live from Tara, we bring you this year's Bealtaine divination."
There was not a word about the rest of the ritual. Those interested were
there; those not there didn't care. These days many grumbled at the
media prominence given to this annual divination.
   Alana took a pace forward.
   "Your move," Sheila said, "or would you rather watch a shapeless one
dance."
   Bran shot a look at Sheila, smiled and quipped, "You've a more
captivating shape, as well you know, but I'd best not turn my luck by
missing this divination."
   "Bran, you archaist..." she began, the rest of her words fading from
his mind as Alana began her dance. She moved across the wooden tiles,
spinning, twirling and leaping. No doubt she could have kept it up for a
long time, but the far viewer had a strict schedule and there were three
phases to this dance, the ancient triad of random choices.
   She stopped, opened her eyes and looked down to read the ogham
character illuminated on the wooden tile at her feet. She broke into a
lively little ditty:
   "It's dawn; it's spring.
   It's time to bring
   To birth something
   That's new, to ring
   Awake the day.
   Commence away."
   Bran was always impressed by the ability of a seer to whip up one of
these hexagram lines. It wasn't that they memorized a score of such
poems. Each divination called for its individual verses.
   "This is the beginning," Sheila explained, "and I intuit a vast door
opening, the seed of a great tree planted, the start of something
special, unheard of, unique, wondrous."
   Bran felt a chill run up his spine. He could remember each Bealtaine
dance from the time he was five years old and he could not recall such a
stress for this normally quite ordinary wood.
   "I wonder what innovation old Niall's cooking up," came a voice.
   "Him? He wouldn't know the word if it bit him," came a reply. "It's
likely another scheme from New Town."
   "And we'll be asked to pay plenty for it," came a third voice.
   Bran almost wished he were at Tara, so he could scan the features of
the Carthaginian ambassador to see if there was any sign of substance to
that. However, the far viewer remained focused on Alana. She had closed
her eyes and started to dance again. She halted quickly and a tile lit
up.
   "Oh, oh!" exclaimed Bran catching sight of those two slanted lines.
   "Must be randomly generated after all," Sheila said. "She'd not
deliberately choose that."
   "So I'm not the only archaist here," Bran shot back.
   Then Alana broke into an eerie chant:
   "I hear a drum.
   Hoofbeats now come.
   Arrows can hum.
   Let's not be dumb.
   Excess tossed, flight,
   Or peace, or fight."
   She barely paused before continuing with her explanation, "I intuit
that this warning is highly significant. The need now is for alert and
possibly quick consideration of the arriving situation." That said she
closed her eyes and immediately leaped ahead. She couldn't be aiming for
something. The integrity of the randomness of the tile symbols was
guaranteed. Even if she stepped back where she had just been, the odds
were nineteen out of twenty that another symbol would be there.
   Bran saw her stop, open her eyes and look down. This time her feet
and what she stood on were kept out of the vision of those watching on
the far viewer. She sang vigorously in a vaguely martial tune:
   "Let's step ahead,
   Go despite dread,
   Lift shields instead,
   Be safely led.
   Tossed the light,
   Assured, do right."
   Only now could the viewers see the symbol lit up at her feet, three
lines to the right of the large central one.
   "Let us carefully, as quickly as may be needed, choose a course of
action that is worthy, assured that our alder shields, our virtue will
see us safely over any opposition and difficulties."
   "And there you have this year's Bealtaine divination from Tara:
Birch, Ivy, Alder. We now return to the Irish Gaulish match."
   Bran looked down at the fidchell board and made a quick move.
   Sheila laughed nervously. He could tell that she was affected by the
omen. "I knew you'd be too preoccupied to catch this," she said as she
quickly moved and removed one of his pieces from the board.
   Bran smiled at her, took a sip of mead and to lighten her mood and
his spoke calmly. "Well, I'll just have to be more careful." However,
his mind was still very much on that ogham dance. His brother Finn and
the royal guards Finn led were sure to take a lot from the military
language of the last wood and the martial air Alana had sung it in
hadn't helped any.
   Bran took a deep breath, shook his head to clear it of his worries
and really looked at the game pieces. There was Sheila one move away
from a fork and darting off the board, if he didn't move thus to block
her.
   "Drat," she said in a mocking tone. "You're just too good at this
game. If that gloomy seer's oracle can't distract you more than..."
   "Neither will your excessive praise," Bran finished with a laugh.
She joined in and the game went on for another third of an hour during
which Gaul scored again. The hall's patrons, all Irish supporters, were
noisy in their dissatisfaction. Then a tense voice from the far viewer
cut through the din.
   "Could you please pause this game."
   Bran looked up startled and saw a bardic type in a cloak of five
colours. The bard was holding a talker.
   "What, by Lugh's Spear, do you think you're doing!?" shouted the
referee.
   The players were stopping in confusion to look at the distraction.
   Ignoring the referee the bard swung to face the viewers and spoke
into the talker. "We apologize for this unscheduled delay of the
championship match, but something astonishing is happening at Tara. We
are switching to live coverage at the royal site."
   Another bardic voice (Bran recognized Kevin MacLyr, the Chief Bard
himself) speaking the purest Classical Irish began:
   "We apologize again for delaying the match. As you can see, though,
an airship has just arrived and is hovering half a manlength from the
ground. Not only do the various ambassadors, including those from New
Town and Ch'ang-an, deny this is one of their airships, but the Chuang
Tsu observatory in the Heavenly Mountains has just confirmed that this
airship left another and larger one still several thousand leagues
high, where it arrived several hours ago from further out in space."
   There was absolute silence in the mead hall. Everyone present fully
understood the ramifications of that announcement. Despite Pan Piao's
quips about the unlettered Westernmost barbarians, everyone in this
room had at least basic education. All knew that there were no habitable
planets in this solar system. That ship had not travelled leagues; it
had come light years. There was life among the stars and it was now
beginning relations with humans.
   "So that's what Alana saw!" exclaimed Bran. "First time I've seen so
quick a fulfillment of a seer's foretelling."
   "What?" asked Sheila, her eyes fixed on the motionless alien airship
on the far viewer.
   "Let's go," said Bran, scooping up the fidchell pieces and board.
   "Where?" she asked.
   "Tara, of course. We'll take my personal flitter. It's got far
hearing. I fear that Alana and MacLyr will be needing my support even
before we arrive.
