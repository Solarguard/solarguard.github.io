INTRODUCTION TO AFRICAN RELIGION, John S. Mbiti, Praeger, New York,
1975.

This is a high school text book, and, as such, a very good basic
introduction to the topic of traditional African religion.

The book begins with a reference to the richness, variety and
influence of African heritage. It defines culture:

   The word culture covers many things, such as the way people live,
   behave and act, and their physical as well as their intellectual
   achievements. Culture shows itself in art and literature, dance,
   music and drama, in the styles of building houses and of people's
   clothing, in social organizations and political systems, in
   religion, ethics, morals and philosophy, in the customs and
   institutions of the people, in their values and laws, and in
   their economic life. p. 7

It mentions the diversity of African cultures, and some widespread
aspects: polygamy, round houses, herding, growing yams, bananas,
millets, "Stories, proverbs, riddles, myths and legends, " (p. 7)
music and crafts. It introduces the five elements of religion:
beliefs, ceremonies, sacred items and places, values, and holy
people. It states the absence of a founder, or of sacred scripture
for African religion. It then challenges the simplistic use of
attributive terms as definitions of African religion: hence, the
author rejects calling African religion ancestor worship, fetishism,
and animism, although ancestors are honoured, fetishes used and
spirits perceived in natural features.

Chapter Three, "Where African Religion is Found" (pp. 19-30), lists
rituals, sacred places, art and symbol, proverbs, names, myths and
customs and then mentions Africa south of the Saharah where, even
among converts to Islam or Christianity, may be found elements of
traditional African spirituality.

   For example, in Nigeria the name Babatunde means 'father
   returns'. It is given to a male child born immediately after the
   death of his grandfather. For a girl it is Yetunde, 'mother
   returns'. The meaning of these names shows the belief that death
   is not the end of life, and that the departed return to be 'born'
   in their family p. 25

   Some shrines belong to a family, such as those connected with
   departed members of the family or their graves. Others belong to
   the community and these are often in groves, rocks, caves, hills,
   mountains, under certain trees and similar places. People respect
   such places, and in some societies no bird, animal or human being
   may be killed if it or he or she is hiding in such places. p. 19

Chapter Four, "African Views of the Universe" (pp. 31-39), begins
with humans' long observation of the natural world, the forming and
sharing of ideas and their complexity and diversity. It mentions
creation, sky and earth, unending natural cycles, order and the
importance of man.

Chapter Five, "Belief in God" (pp. 40-53), begins by stating all
Africans are theists, possibly from considering creation, from
realizing human limitation and from observing natural forces,
especially storms, lightning and thunder. There is a page long list
of names for God. It examines God as creator, as sustainer, as
provider and as ruler. It sees him as father and as friend. Such
attributes as just, merciful, good, omnipotent, omniscient,
omnipresent, etc. are stated.

Chapter Six, "How God is Approached by People" (pp. 54-64), looks at
worship, prayers and sacrifices.

   African traditional prayers generally include praise,
   thanksgiving, a declaration of the state of affairs in which the
   prayers are offered, and requests. Such prayers always have
   concrete intentions and people do not 'beat about the bush' when
   saying their prayers. They request such things as: good health,
   healing, protection from danger, safety in travelling or some
   other undertaking, security, prosperity, preservation of life,
   peace and various benefits for individuals. For the community at
   large, prayer may ask for rain, peace, the cessation of epidemics
   and dangers to the nation, success in war or raids, the
   acceptance of sacrifices and offerings, and fertility for people,
   animals and crops. pp. 55-56

Sacrifices are defined as blood offerings. There is mention of
sacrificing in time of need an animal of one colour, belonging to an
upright person. What has been sacrificed may be consumed by priests,
by participants in the ritual, left at the ritual site, or returned
to the owner. There are intermediaries, gods and spirits, between
God and humans.

Chapter Seven, "The Spirits" (pp. 65-76), begins with the two kinds
of spirits, nature spirits and human spirits. Nature spirits are
associated with the sky (weather, celestial objects, etc.) and the
earth (natural features, including those dealing with water). Human
spirits are those departed recently (four or five generations) and
those who died earlier than that. The ones who died a long time ago
(outside of prominent and known personages) are generally met with
distrust and apprehension. It is different for those who have died
more recently.

   They are considered to be still part of their families. They are
   believed to live close to their homes where they lived when they
   were human beings. They show interest in their surviving
   families, and in return their families remember them by pouring
   out parts of their drinks and leaving bits of food for them from
   time to time. The living dead may also visit their surviving
   relatives in dreams or visions, or even openly, and make their
   wishes known. pp. 72-73

Chapter Eight, "The Origin and Early State of Man" (pp. 77-81),
begins by mentioning the significance of oral tradition, the great
number and variety of myths and the sky as the home of the first
humans in some myths. Others have man created on earth. In some
myths, sky and earth were connected and became separated.

Chapter Nine, "Birth and Time of Youth" (pp. 82-97), conveys the
importance and joy of birth. The mother takes certain measures to
ensure the saftety of the expected baby. These include refraining
from some kinds of work, dietary observations and wearing charms.
There are celebrations and rituals to welcome the baby and to
protect it. Charms are often placed around the baby's arm, waist or
neck. There are naming ceremonies and names are taken seriously. A
baby can be named for the day of the week on which it was born, for
a departed relative, to show the gratitude of its parents, after an
animal, even a demeaning word so as to avert harm. As twins have a
reduced chance of survival, they are considered an ill-fortune. The
shedding of blood in the circumcission initiation ceremony makes one
an adult, binds one to the land and includes one in the community.
This ceremony can be preceeded by a period months long during which
the young person is educated in traditional matters.

Chapter Ten, "Marriage and Family Life" (pp. 98-109), begins with
the obligation of an initiated adult to marry.

   Marriage is the meeting-point for the three layers of human life
   according to African religion. These are the departed, the living
   and those to be born. The departed come into the picture because
   they are the roots on whom the living stand. The living are the
   link between death and life. Those to be born are the buds in the
   loins of the living, and marriage makes it possible for them to
   germinate and sprout. p. 98

The author mentions that he has written a book called LOVE AND
MARRIAGE IN AFRICA. He mentions the involvement of parents in the
selection of marriage partners, visits, gifts, customs conerning the
bride's change of residence, marriage ceremonies and celebrations.
The importance of children means a childless couple may take steps
to ensure offspring, such as an additional wife or another bed
partner for the first wife. Children have errands when young, added
to as they age.

   When the parents become old and weak it is the duty of the
   children, especially the heirs or sons, to look after the
   parents and the affairs of the family. Finally when the parents
   die it is the duty of their surviving children to bury them
   properly, to remember them, to look after their graves, to give
   bits of food and pour libations to them where this is the custom,
   and to keep a good relationship with their departed parents who
   are now spirits of the living dead. p. 109

Chapter Eleven, "Death and the Hereafter" (pp. 110-125), begins with
reference to the many and varied myths about the origin of death.
The cause of death may appear physical, but usually a spirit or
human magic lies at its root. The importance of death means funeral
ceremonies are performed attentively.

   Generally the disposal of the body takes place the same or the
   following day. This is mainly because of the tropical heat which
   makes the body decompose fast. In most parts of Africa burial is
   the usual means of disposing the body of a dead person. It may
   take place in the back yard of one of the houses of the village,
   in a family burial place, or at the original place of birth. The
   grave may be rectangular, oval, cave-like, or even a big pot made
   for that purpose. pp. 113-114

Some belongings of the deceased are buried, too, to be of service in
the journey to the next world, or after arriving. There are funeral
rites, simple or ornate, depending on the person concerned. The
funeral is generally followed by feasting. Sometimes white clay is
applied by mourners as a sign of grieving. Sometimes some residences
may be abandoned.

The next world is often viewed as close to this one, though we
cannot see it. For four or five generations, while remembered, the
recently dead are included in respectful ways. Afterwards, they may
be of aid to diviners or enter into natural features or be the cause
of fear among strangers who encounter them.

Chapter Twelve, "Rituals and Festivals" (pp. 126-140), mentions
again the various rituals concerned with the individual's life
cycle. It continues with community rituals related to the cycle of
the year agriculturally, which includes seeking or moderating rain
consecrating and protecting new fields, as well as accompanying
planting and harvesting. There are herding rituals, including for
milking. There are rituals for health and healing, for the building
of new homes, for hunting, for smithing and for rulers. Nigerian
masquerades are mentioned.

Chapter Thirteen, "Religious Objects and Places" (pp. 141-149),
starts with personal items, moves on to items of community ritual,
such as costumes, masks and staffs, and touches on sacred colours.

   The commonest ritual colours are black, white and red. These
   colours signify different things in different parts of Africa.
   For example, only black animals are sacrificed in certain parts
   of Uganda, Nigeria, Rhodesia and many other places. Black for
   such people is the colour of purity and sacredness. On the other
   hand, elsewhere, black is associated with death, danger and evil.
   White animals only are sacrificed in other parts of Africa, thus
   signifying that white is the colour of purity and sacredness for
   those people. Yet there are parts of Africa where white is the
   colour associated with death, spirits, and evil. p. 143

There are also ritual numbers, and, for example, the
circumambulation of a sacred tree seven times in places. Offerings,
including sacrificial offerings, are sacred. There are man-made
places (altars, shrines, temples and graves), but most sacred space
is natural.

   They include groves and forests, trees, waterfalls and rivers,
   lakes, rocks and mountains. They are symbolically the
   meeting-point between the heavens or sky and the earth, and
   therefore of the invisible and visible worlds. People use them
   for rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices, offerings and praying. Such
   places are not put to common use; this would desecrate them.
   Where necessary there are people who look after the general
   tidiness of these places. In any case there are ritual and
   religious leaders who take charge of any public use of these
   places, and see to it that they are kept in order where and when
   necessary. p. 146

Chapter Fourteen, "Religious Leaders" (pp. 150-163), begins by
underlining the importance of people performing sacred functions,
even part time. There are medicine-men (male and female) healing the
sick, through physical and spiritual means and providing advice for
a broad range of personal perplexities. There are seers divining to
discover the unknown. Page 155 has two photos, top showing a Kenyan
diviner holding his divination gourd, bottom showing the pebbles and
stones of the gourd. The Ifa divination system of Nigeria is
mentioned. Mediums, trained in special schools in such countries as
Nigeria and Ghana, are possessed by spirits, and communicate in
another's voice what generally requires an associated diviner to
interpret.

There are other special people: seers seeing without special
training, elders in charge of rituals, rain-makers, traditional
rulers, and priests:

   Traditional priests are found in Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, Ghana
   and other parts of West Africa, where people had or have temples
   and cults associated with major spirits (or divinities). p. 159

Chapter Fifteen, "Magic and Medicine" (pp. 164-174), begins with the
widespread abhorrence of those who abuse magic. People, conscious of
potential magical repercussions, tend to treat others well. Medicine
is used to remedy the abuse of magic, and to promote the well-being
of the one using medicine.

   Whether this medicine functions in every case or not need not
   matter very much. It is the belief in the efficacy of such
   medicine which inspires hope in the sick, confidence in the
   hunter and businessman, courage in the sufferer and the
   traveller, and a sense of security in the many who feel that they
   are surrounded by mystical and physical enemies. p. 174

Chapter Sixteen, "Morals in African Religion" (pp. 175-181), begins
with the largely social and community nature of African morality.
This includes: respecting parents and elders, bringing up children
well, hospitality, honesty, reliability, courage, etc. Natural
calamities are often considered punishment for moral failing.

Chapter Seventeen, "The Meeting of African Religion and Other
Religions" (pp. 182-194), begins with early Christianity. Then, it
mentions response to Christianity with the arrival of the Portuguese
and later Nineteenth and Twentieth Century conversions. Christianity
is growing rapidly despite its associations with colonialism.

   Another major problem facing Christianity in Africa is the large
   number of Church divisions, denominations, groups and sects. Many
   of these were imported from abroad. Many more were started by
   African Christians themselves, partly because they did not wish
   to remain indefinitely under the domination of foreign
   missionaries, partly because of personal wishes for power, partly
   because of wanting to make Christianity reflect African culture
   and problems, and for various other reasons. p. 184

The chapter continues with reference to Islam, spread by the sword
and facing the present problem of its highly legalistic nature.
There is mention of Jews, Hindus, Sikhs with virtually no African
converts and of Baha'i. Many African ways have remained even among
people converted to other religions.

The last chapter, "The Value of Religion" (pp 195-202), begins with
the time, material resources, even life itself, that many people are
prepared to offer religion. It mentions freedom of religion in many
lands, religious holidays, spiritual understandings and morality. It
notes the communal nature of festivals, the marking of transitions
and the celebration of life. It concludes with a mention of the
value of religion in conveying a sense of humility to humans.

This is a high school text book, replete with four pages of
questions, chapter by chapter, and many appropriate photos. It is an
easy to read, sympathetic and good introduction to the topic.
