EVERYONE'S UNITED NATIONS, A Handbook on the Work of the United Nations
Department of Public Information, United Nations, 1986 (1948)

This highly informative volume begins with a two page foreward by
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuillar stating the choice humanity
faces between, "almost infinite promise and terminal deastruction."

Part One, "The Structure of the United Nations" (pp. 3-34):

Arising from the devastating wars of the first half of the 20th Century,
named by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, its Charter signed in San
Francisco on June 26, 1945, the UN officially began existence on October
24, 1945, when that Charter had been ratified by a majority of the
membership, including all five permanently on the Security Council.

A list of members, as of the date of publication, occurs on pages 11-13.
UN organs: the General Assembly of all members, the Security Council
(fifteen, including China, England, France, Russia and the US), Economic
and Social Council and the International Court of Justice are briefly
outlined.

UN administration is presented.

Part Two, "The Work of the United Nations" (pp. 37-428), describes UN
efforts at peacekeeping, peacemaking, disarmament, economic and social
development, human rights, decolonization and international law. It also
briefly sketches global agencies, such as the International Atomic
Energy Agency, International Labour Organization, Food and Agriculture
Organization, UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,
World Health Organization, World Bank, International Monetary Fund,
International Civil Aviation Organization, Universal Postal Union,
International Telecommunication Union, World Meteorological Organization
International Maritime Organization, etc.

Appendices provide the UN Charter, Statute of the International Court of
Justice and Universal declaration of Human Rights.

As the new century continues, when many, including those at the highest
levels of US government appear to have forgotten the reasoning, purpose
and resolve of those who founded this fundamental instrument for global
security, it does well to remember the Preamble of the Charter:

We the peoples
of the United Nations
determined

to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in
our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to

reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of
the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations
large and small, and

to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the
obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law
can be maintained, and

to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger
freedom,

and for these ends

to practice tolerance and live together with one another as good
neighbours, and

to ensure by the acceptance of principles and the institution of
methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common
interest, and

to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and
social advancement of all peoples,

have resolved to
combine our efforts to
accomplish these aims.

Accordingly, our respective Governments, through representatives
assembled in the city of San Francisco, who have exhibited their full
powers found to be in good and due form, have agreed to the present
Charter of the United Nations and do hereby establish an international
organization to be known as the United Nations.

This Preamble, this book, the organization it describes and the world
viewpoint, perception and understanding embodied within in remain very
good basics for healthy human existence.
