Hindu Myths, transl. Wendy O'Flaherty, Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1975

This volume presents some seventy five Hindu tales translated into
English prose. The translator begins with an introduction (pp. 11-22)
straightaway presenting the depth of Hindu thought:

   Every Hindu myth is different; all Hindu myths are alike. In spite
   of the deep-seated, totally compelling world-view that moulds every
   image and symbol, every word and idea of any Hindu myth, inspite of
   the stress placed upon traditional form at the expense of the
   individual artist, each myth celebrates the belief that the universe
   is boundlessly various, that everything occurs simultaneously, that
   all possibilities may exist without excluding each other. p. 11

The sources (including Rig Veda, Mahabarata, Ramayana, Puranas) are
mentioned. The vast time scale is stated, ranging from c. 1200 BCE to
the 1500s CE. Some guidelines in making the selection of material from
so vast a corpus are stated (some myths from each major period, focused
on deities, presenting various lengths and types, all enjoyed by the
translator).

There is a guide to pronunciation (p. 9) and acknowledgements (p. 23).

The book concludes with appendices: abbreviations (301), bibliography
(302-309), notes (310-338), glossary and index (319-358).

The tales begin with creation myths, concern such deities as Indra,
Agni, Shiva and Vishnu, draw also on the vedas and the puranas.

This inadequate beginning hopefully will become a more complete Michael
McKenny summary before the New Year.
