To Sansoucy Walker

Brilliant the leaf that lies upon the ground,
A leaf that sought no cares; seasons spin round.
The leaves will fall, yet you were one I knew,
A green that throve alive within the blue.

Brilliant the leaf that lies upon the earth,
A source of joy, of song, of art and mirth.
This leaf inspired a flock of birds to fly,
To raise their eyes, to send their voices high.

Brilliant the leaf that fell and bared the tree,
For those that stay are grey compared to thee.
At thy falling fled sun and pours the rain.
The eyes are wet, the hearts are filled with pain.

Brilliant the soul a box cannot enclose,
That soars above the ground and skyward goes.
The first of us, the best of us has gone
And without cares now soars towards the dawn.

Michael McKenny, November 9, 2005 C.E.

In January 1980, an SF and fantasy writers' group formed in Ottawa. It
meets monthly. I was one of the founding members and some of my poems
and stories were my response to assignments for this writers' workshop.
The originator, leader and driving force behind this writers' group
died on Saturday. This imperfect poem inadequately mourns her passing.
"Without cares" in the poem refers to her pen name, Sansoucy, which may
be translated "Without cares" in English.
