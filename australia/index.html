<p>The original inhabitants of Australia dwelt longest in isolation from the rest of humanity. At present, this site contains Michael McKenny's reviews of two key anthropological works, a good book surveying Australian archaeology, a fourth and more popular treatment of Aborigines, as well as links to the links page of the Australian Archaeological Association and an Aboriginal links page. This Solarguard Australia section was last updated with minor edits on April 26, 2008 C.E.<p>
