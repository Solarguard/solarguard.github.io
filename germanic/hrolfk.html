HROLF KRAKI'S SAGA, Poul Anderson, Ballantine, New York, 1973

This volume in the celebrated Ballantine Fantasy Series begins with
a splendid six page introduction by series editor Lin Carter (author
himself of such sword and sorcery as the six Thongor books) who
mentions the overlap of the Northern thing and modern Fantasy. Thus,
William Morris translated two sagas (Eyrbyggja and Grettla), E.R.
Eddison (of THE WORM OUROBOROS etc) translated Egil's Saga and many
other prominent Fantasy writers evidence the influence of
Scandinavian literature. Lin Carter minimizes what has survived
about Hrolf and there is no doubt that Poul Anderson, one of the
most popular SF and F authors of the Twentieth Century, has produced
an entertaining telling of the tale.

There is a five page introduction by Poul Anderson comparing Hrolf
to Arthur and Charlemagne, mentioning various tellings of Hrolf's
Saga (one sung to St. Olaf, one rendered into Latin by Saxo
Grammaticus, Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla etc. and the Icelandic
HROLF'S SAGA.

   All the sources contradict each other, and occasionally
   themselves, on various points. Moreover, they are too sparse,
   leave too much unexplained, for the modern reader who is not a
   specialist in the early North.

   I have long wanted to make a reconstruction, if not the
   reconstruction: put together the best parts, fill in the gaps,
   use the old words where they seem right and otherwise find new
   ones. My gratitude is great to Ian and Betty Ballantine and to
   Lin Carter for this chance to try. p. xviii-xix

He speaks of the Saga's grim time, different pre-Christian mentality
and mythic quality. He provides a guide to the pronunciation of Old
Norse.

The beginning of Anderson's novel shows a woman telling the tale to
King Aethelstan. She starts with Denmark, the Skjoldungs descended
from the babe in the boat whose father was Odin, the rivalry of
Skjoldungs and the Frey-descended Ynglings centred at Uppsala, the
Gotar who produced Beowulf, Frodhi forcing two troll-women to grind
his millstone and the Viking host they summon in three pages of
verse. Frodhi's son Halfdan ruled and after him Halfdan's sons,
Frodhi (in Scania) and Halfdan (in Zealand). Halfdan had three
children, two the brothers Hroar and Helgi. Frodhi attacked, slew
his brother and forced the chiefs to vow by Njord, Frey and Thor to
support him. The boys were taken to Vifil's Island. Vifil agreed to
look after them. The word Kraki is defined ("a fir trunk whose
stubbed-off limbs made a kind of ladder" p. 17)

When Frodhi couldn't find them, he suspected magic and sent for
those skilled in it. They said the boys were not on land. Frodhi
had the island searched in vain. They went to Uncle Saevil, a jarl.
A typical Northern hall is described:

   It is a long wooden building, with a roof of sod or of shakes,
   oft-times a clerestory; the beam-ends are apt to be carved in
   fanciful shapes. If there are two floors, a gallery runs around
   the walls. Windows are shuttered in bad weather, and belike
   covered by thin-scraped skins. Inside, one enters through a
   foreroom, where feet are wiped and outer garments left hanging.
   Unless the lord is suspicious and commands his guests to leave
   their weapons here as well, these are brought into the main room
   and hung up, that the luster of metal and of the painted leather
   on shields help brighten its gloom.

   The ground floor of the hall is hard-packed earth, thickly strewn
   with rushes, juniper boughs, or other sweet things, often
   changed. Down the middle run two or three trenches, or sometimes
   only one, wherein roar the longfires, that servants feed with
   wood taken from stacks at the far end. Flanking them goes a
   double row of great wooden pillars, upbearing the top floor, or
   the rafters if there is none. They too are graven and colored, to
   show gods or heroes or beasts and intertwining vines. Against the
   wainscoted walls, earthen platforms raise the benches a foot or
   two above the floor. In the middle of one wall, commonly the
   north, stands the high seat of the master and his lady, held by
   two lesser posts which are especially holy. Straight across the
   chamber is a slightly lower seat for the most honored guest.
   Between the weapons ablink behind the benches are other carvings,
   skins, horns, torches or rushlights flaring in their sconces.

   At mealtimes the women and servants set trestles in front of the
   benches and lay boards across them. On these go meat and drink,
   prepared usually in a separate cookhouse for dread of wildfire.
   Later the tables are removed, and when men have drunk enough,
   those of higher standing stretch out on the benches to sleep;
   their followers use the floor.

   Shut-beds for the master, mistress and chief guests may be at
   either end; or there may be upper rooms; or there may be a bower
   standing aside from the hall, a narrow building of one or two
   floors where women spin and weave by day in well-lighted
   airiness, and at night the well-born sleep free from snoring and
   eavesdropping.

   Around a courtyard cluster the outbuildings. Beyond them may lie
   the homes, byres, and worksteads of humbler families; and a
   stockade may enclose everything. pp. 23-24

The boys wearing hooded cloaks became Saevil's servants. After three
years they went along with him to Frodhi's Yuletide feast at a hall
built near sacred oaks. Yule especially honours Thor, guarding us on
the longest night. At the feast, Frodhi had a seer on a high three
legged beech stool (with one leg ash, one elm and one thorn) speak.
She recited verses meaning there they are and will take revenge.
They escape to the woods, return and burn the hall.

The two brothers remained on good terms while they lived. The Hammer
hallowed the marriage of Hroar and of Valthona whose father was jarl
in Gotaland. Helgi went to the island of Als where he told Queen
Olof he'd have her for his wife. She replied she knew of none better
than he. When he insisted they spend that night together, she plied
him with rare southern wine and when he toppled onto the bed in a
drunken stupor, she had all his hair cut, pitch smeared on him and
he was stuffed into a sack of rags which was borne to the shore.
When he was discovered in the morning, her forces had assembled, and
he sailed away.

He returned the next year and lured her out to see treasure chests.
She promised to wed him. Instead he took her to his ship where he
kept her for a week before he let her go. Hroar presented with the
talk of war, arranged peace. He was told war produces fame.

   "May not a fame better and longer-lived come from building the
   land? We've work for many lifetimes--nailing down peace within
   and without this kingdom, clearing fields, raising houses,
   launching ships for fishery and trade, making good laws and
   seeing that they're kept, bringing in outland arts.... Well,
   kinsman, I need not talk as if I stood on the Thingstone. p. 59

Olof hid her pregnancy, gave birth secretly, named the girl after a
dog and gave her to commoners to raise. Hroar offered all claim to
the Danish kingdom to Helgi for a ring. Helgi gave him the ring.
Hroar moved and founded Roskilde. This novel states there was no
hall greater than this save Odin's, but surprisingly the Christian
veneer that Hroar and Helgi paid little heed to Northern gods is
retained. Helgi went off a-Viking and the creature Grendel ravaged
Hroar's hall until Bjovulf slew it and its mother.

Helgi went in disguise to Als, saw lovely Yrsa and took her back
with him. He wed her and they had a boy born at Yule.

   Next day, being sure Yrsa would live, he slaughtered a herd of
   horses and oxen in the holy shaw, and called men to a feast only
   less mighty than his wedding. Himself he poured water upon the
   boy and named him Hrolf. Warriors who had fared beside him from
   end to end of the known world, clanged blade on shield and hailed
   their atheling. pp. 74-75

Gotar king Hugleik fell fighting Franks. Bjovulf supported the young
heir. Swedan's Egil fell gored by a rampant sacrificial bull.
Bjovulf ended up Gotar king, Adhils Sweden's. Olof told Yrsa her
parentage and took her daughter to Als. There Adhils came courting.
Yrsa became his queen. Helgi drank lonely in a fort. At Yule he lay
with an elf-woman. She bore him a daughter named Skuld. Helgi went
to Uppsala, timing his arrival to coincide with the absence of
Adhil's twelve beserks.

   On a height outside the burg lifted the mightiest temple in the
   North. It was made in the wonted way of a building raised to the
   gods, roof piled upon roof as if the whole were about to fly
   skywards. But these gables and monster-headed beam-ends stood
   clear against the shaw which lowered behind, being neither
   tarred nor painted but sheathed in gold. Inside were the images,
   wooden but tall and richly bedecked, of the twelve high gods --
   Odin with the Spear, Thor with the Hammer, Frey on his boar
   brandishing the huge sign of his maleness, Baldr whom Hel has
   taken to rule beside her over the dead, Tyr whose right hand the
   Fenris Wolf bit off, Aegir of the Sea whose wife Ran casts nets
   out for ships, Heimdal bearing the Gyallar Horn which he shall
   blow at the Weird of the World, and others of whom there go
   fewer tales. At holy times, most of the shire could crowd within.
   Then the foremost men slaughtered horses, caught the blood in
   bowls, sprinkled it off willow twigs onto the folk; in great
   kettles seethed the meat, of which all partook. Otherwise women
   tended the temple, cleaned it, washed the gods in water from a
   holy spring. pp. 98-99

He and his men were received courteously. He remained a week telling
Yrsa he'd come to take her back. She refused. He left with Adhil's
honeyed words and rich gifts. Adhils' beserks attacked, slew Helgi
who fell valiantly. Adhils paid weregild to Hroar. At Yule, Hrolf
now twelve swore by the boar passed round to be brave. That summer
he bravely fought Saxons. Hroar's hall burned down by accident.
Hrorik tossed overboard the ring Hroar refused to share with him.
Hroar died that winter. Hrorik died fighting. Hrolf was acclaimed
king.

Svipdag son of Svip sought to join King Adhils. The beserks wanted
to fight Svipdag. Adhils calmed them, though on the morrow there was
a holmgang.

   This is a usage among the heathen, when men wish to fight out a
   challenge. They go onto a holm, a small island, where few or none
   can watch them and maybe get to brawling. Four willow wands mark
   off a field, and he who is driven beyond them is deemed to have
   lost. Otherwise the blows go by turns. The business can be until
   first blood, or yielding, or death. p. 117

Svipdag slew four beserks. Queen Yrsa's warriors joined him when
King Adhils bade the rest to attack all together. Adhils called them
off. Later, they attacked Svipdag. He slew one. The survivors were
banished. Hrolf fought and restored his kingdom, weakened before he
took charge. Hrolf was like a wildcat in speed, agility and
cleanliness. Hrolf heard Skuld's foster parents complain of her
uncany nature, her interest in magic more than a rune cut in a
fingernail. He spoke with her. Later he followed her beneath the
full moon. An elf-woman stopped him and gave him the sword Skofnung.

   With Gram, which Sigurdh bore against Fafnir, and with Tyrfing
   the accursed, and with Lovi of which more later, Skofnung was one
   of the magical swords, that never rusted and always bit. Goodly
   it was to see, long and broad, shimmering now brown and now blue.
   The haft was of a black, hard, unknown wood, gold-entwined, and
   on the pommel was a many-faced stone, clear white but splintering
   light into fiery hues. Runes were graven in the crossguard which
   none could read. p. 129

The beserks led an attacking force. Svipdag led defenders and with
caltrops and courage routed the invaders. The beserks tried again.
Adhils stood by while Svipdag fought outnumbered. Waking from a
dream, Svip sent out his other two sons to help their brother. They
turned the tide. The three brothers left Adhils and went to Hrolf's
new hall. Hrolf's beserks were set to fight them when they would not
state inferiority. Hrolf forbade it. Skuld was wed to Hjorvardh who
ruled now at Odense.

Hvit, who knew Finnish magic, married king Hring in Norway. When the
old king went off, she sought to seduce his heir. As Bjorn rejected
Hvit, she turned him into a bear by day man by night creature. His
lover, Bera, stayed with him in his cave. He told her his time was
come, to ask when he was slain for that under his left shoulder, not
to eat his flesh, lest that harmed the three boys she carried and of
the three weapons he left his sons. Bera got the gold ring, but
unbelievably ate his flesh. Three boys were born Frodhi (half-elk),
Thori (dog's feet) and Bjarki (wholesome).

Grown, Frodhi went to Bjorn's cave and obtained a short sword that
could bite rock. He became a robber. Thori got an axe and became
king of the West Gotar. Bjarki learned his parentage, slew Hvit,
obtained the longsword Lovi and went to join Hrolf, strengthened by
drinking some of Frodhi's blood given him by Frodhi. Bjarki stopped
at a hut and learned that the old couple's son lived in Hrolf's bone
pile a sport for Hrolf's men. Bjarki arrived when the others were
out, extracted Hott from the bone pile and set him beside himself on
a bench. When Hrolf's men returned and one tossed a large bone at
Hott, Bjarki hurled it back slaying the one who'd thrown it.

Yule came and Hrolf forbade his men from facing the beast that
ravaged at that time. Bjarki and Hott went to face it. With the
magic blade Lovi, Bjarki slew the troll. He made Hott drink its
blood. Hott alone proved willing to approach the motionless form of
the beast when Hrolf and his men saw it on the morrow. He was now
reckoned a stalwart man and armed with the sword Goldhilt.

Hrolf led his men towards Uppsala. They came to a hut. Its uncany
master took them all in, served them well and advised concerning the
route to Uppsala. Some men found it a cold night. The host advised
that these be sent back. Hrolf complied. Hrolf travelled all day and
came to a hut whose master was the same uncany oldster. There was
fine hospitality this night, too. Some of the men woke thirsty. The
host suggested that these be sent back. Hrolf complied.

Hrolf came to Uppsala with his dozen greatest warriors. Bjarki asked
that their horses be stabled well. Adhils abused them. Adhils' hall
was dark and cold. There were pits there and armed men were hiding
behind tapestries. The Danes threw back the attack, slaying many.
Fires are stoked high. Stokers were tossed in. Hrolf tossed his
shield on a fire and leapt over. Danes followed. Swedes fled. Adhils
sent a troll-boar inside against the Danes. Hrolf's warhound Gram
slew it. Adhils had his hall set ablaze. Using benches Danes broke
through a wall. Hrolf's hawk slew Swedish hawks. Hrolf's men
slaughtered Adhils'. Yrsa refused to leave Uppsala. She did bestow
gifts, including Adhils' famous ring Pig of the Swedes. She gave
horses to replace those abused by Adhils. Foemen pursued. Danes
slowed these by tossing treasure behind them. Even Adhils stopped to
retrieve Pig of the Swedes. Hrolf struck him. Swedes fled.

Danes rode until they came to a hut and that same uncany old host.
He offered them old black weapons. Foolishly fearing evil spells,
they refuse to take them, thus angering Odin. So, when Skuld struck
one Yule they died. Among the flaws in this reconstruction is that
both here in the rejection of the weapons of Allfather and at the
close of the saga when the heroes inconsistently in the same breath
speak of being soon in Valhalla and of Odin being an evil enemy, the
Christian veneer is glaringly retained. Another flaw is the courtly
unsatisfied love between Svipdag and Queen Yrsa, more a product of a
Christian medieval troubador than of a skald of the heroic age.
Despite its flaws this book is an entertaining story and contains
interesting glimpses of the early North.
