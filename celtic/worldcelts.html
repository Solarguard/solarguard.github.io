<center>THE WORLD OF THE CELTS</center><p>

Simon James, Thames and Hudson, London, 1993.<p>

The first chapter, "Who Were the Celts?", begins referring to Celtic
speakers (p. 7), mentions their geographical extent, "Not just in
Britain and Ireland, but from Spain and France to Southern Germany and
the Alpine lands, Bohemia, and later in Italy, the Balkans and even
central Turkey." (p. 7) He mentions that the application of the term
Celt to inhabitants of the British Isles originated in 17th and 18th
Century studies in linguistics and writes that, "The kilt itself is
known to have been invented as late as about 1730 by an English
industrialist, Thomas Rawlinson..." (p. 9) He would restrict the use of
the term Celt for the period commencing with the first use of the term
by Classical authors. (pp. 10-11)<p>

He mentions three sources of knowledge: documentary, linguistics and
archaeology. He outlines the Hallstatt and La Tene cultures, the attacks
on Rome (c. 390 BC) and Delphi (279 BC) and pressure on the Celts from
Germans and Romans. "Roman rule seems to have virtually extinguished the
culture and, very slowly, the languages of the continental Celts." (p.
12) He moves on to refer to the further pressures by the Vikings,
English and French. He briefly describes the archaeological sites of
Hallstatt and La Tene and their identification as evidencing two
distinct chronological periods.<p>

The second chapter, "The Earliest Celts", takes a closer look at the
archaeological remains of the Hallstatt and La Tene cultures and
discusses such topics as wide-ranging pre-historic trade, the rise of
chiefdoms and Celtic migrations.<p>

Chapter Three, "The Celtic Lands", surveys the various Celtic
regions. "The Celtic world was not an empire, but a mosaic of tribes, a
rich and diverse pattern of chiefdoms and kingdoms." (p. 33) He
questions Roman accounts that Rome was not completely taken by Celts in
c. 390 BC, discusses Celts in Italy, for example the Insubres whose
capital was at what is now Milan and the Boii one of whose centres is
now Bologna. He continues with a look at the La Tene homeland across the
Alps under pressure from Germans. He considers the Danubian lands whence
the Celts thrust into Greece and what is now Turkey. He mentions, "The
existence of the central shrine, Drunemeton ('oak santuary')" in
Galatia. (p. 41) He finds Iberia interesting as, "There was no general
adoption of La Tene art or other aspects of material culture." (p. 42)<p>

He proceeds to consider Gaul, opining that, "Celtic tongues were
already widely spoken during Halstatt times," (p. 44) including in
Britain, Ireland and Spain. (pp. 43-44) He concludes from paucity of
archaeological evidence an absence of Gaulish trade with the Classical
Mediterranean from c. 400 BC to the Second Century BC. He then mentions
Roman entrance into Gaul in the late Second Century BC. He continues
with a look at Britain, observing that earlier archaeological dating of
putative remains of the Belgae in Britain has now been revised
("Post-Caesar" p. 48) and, "The Belgae in Britain are invisible
archaeologically." (p. 48) He proceeds to dispute the accounts of
immigration to Ireland in THE BOOK OF INVASIONS.<p>

Chapter Four, "The Patterns of Life", mentions the division of Celtic
society into Warriors, Men of Art and Freemen, discusses agriculture,
buildings, hill forts, physique, health, characteristics and
accoutrement of each sex, feasting and clientage.<p>

Chapter Five, "The Celts at War", considers arms, armour, nudity in
battle ("Sensible for an unarmoured man in that wounds contaminated with
dirty cloth are highly prone to infection." p. 77), chariots and
cavalry, "Challenges to single combat," (p. 81) taking heads and,
"Celtic lack of discipline or tenacity," (p. 83) He takes a special look
at the great Roman victory at Telamon in 225 BC. The Celts were, "Equal
to their foes in courage, and inferior only, as a force and
individually, in their arms." (p. 85)<p>

Chapter Six, "Gods and the Afterlife", mentions multiplicity of gods,
triads, reincarnation, druids, sacred groves and sanctuaries,
sacrifices, burials and cremations.<p>

Chapter Seven, "La Tene Art and Technology", mentions the high
quality of Celtic accomplishments in metalwork, glasswork, pottery,
carpentry and shipbuilding. He adds, "The richest La Tene art is
concentrated on items of personal adornment (jewelry, mirrors, elaborate
weapons), on transport (horse and vehicle harness), and on equipment for
aristocratic feasting. Most of it was designed to be seen on or
immediately about the person, and it is probable that the display of the
wealth and taste of the owner was its principal raison d'etre." (p. 115)<p>

Chapter Eight, "The Celts and the Classical World," informs the
reader, "Under Roman rule, many Celtic speaking regions maintained much
of their identity for a surprisingly long time, and achieved a degree of
political stability and material prosperity far beyond that of the Iron
Age." (p. 117) He mentions changes in Gaul, including the growth of the
oppida even prior to the Roman conquest. He mentions the expansion of
Rome into Celtic regions, including Caesar's conquest of Gaul and the
conquest of Britain. He then considers Romanization with increased
urbanization, service in the Roman army and some Gauls entering the
higher classes at Rome, including the Senate.<p>

The chapter continues with a consideration of religion under Roman
rule. Tolerant in general, the Romans moved against the druids,
"Ostensibly because of their association with human sacrifice, but more
probably arising from the fear that such a supratribal organization
might foment rebellion." (p. 143) The Empire brought not only the
Graeco-Roman pantheon with the application of correspondences to Celtic
deities, but also more exotic deities. It also fostered man made
structures for worship, as well as sculptured representations of those
worshipped.<p>

There is a look at agriculture under Roman rule and the disorders
that attended civil wars, external invasions and the collapse of the
Empire.<p>

Chapter Nine, "The Celts in Ireland", repeats his opinion that La
Tene culture was adopted without large scale immigration. Writing, "The
surviving Irish tales are as close to the ancient Celtic world as we can
get," (p. 158) he quotes several passages mostly from THE TAIN. He then
mentions Christianization, Christian art and ogam.<p>

Chapter Ten, "The Celtic Renaissance", looks at the Dark Ages, the
Arthurian legend, the arrival of immigrants from Ireland to what is now
called Scotland after them. the Celtic Church and the impact of the
Vikings.<p>

Chapter Eleven, "To Modern Times", observes both the disintegration
of traditional societies with large scale emigration and, "Growing
consciousness of identity, leading eventually to the reassertion of
Celtic nationhood." (p. 177)<p>

This well-illustrated volume is an interesting consideration of the
topic, and the reader is advised to note what here is fact and what is
opinion.<p>
