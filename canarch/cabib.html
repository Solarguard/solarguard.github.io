A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF ARCHAEOLOGY IN CANADA, C. Michel Boucher

Guide to the Bibliography

This bibliography contains over 1500 items that deal almost exclusively
with Canadian archaeology. An attempt has been made to include as 
many of
the older (pre-1900) publications as possible, especially newspaper
articles.

Titles are listed by author and date, in alphabetical, then numerical
order. The system is commonly used in anthropological publications.

Generally, one will find that, in a single year, published articles
precede books, which in their turn precede manuscripts. Items where no
date is provided follow all dated items. Books edited by an author will
follow his own publications under a separate heading.

There will sometimes appear to be repetitions (i.e. manuscript and 
article
or thesis and publication), but only in cases where the manuscript has
been judged to be longer. Where there is an even choice, publication 
only
has been entered.

All journals and organisms whose names occur frequently have been 
reduced
to acronyms, the list of which follows.
