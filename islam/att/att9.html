Mecca and the Hijaz. He also covered Egypt, northern Syria and
eastern Anatolia. From 813 to 819 the major theme is the war in
Iraq. After al Mamun's arrival in Baghdad, there were uprisings, his
splendid marriage ceremony and his campaigns against the Byzantines.
Sources are discussed, acknowledgements rendered.

A.H. 198 (1/9/813-21/8/814): War ended; easterners, Iraqis, those in
the Hijaz obeyed al Mamun. He named Hasan ibn Sahl governor of

Saraya met and destroyed this army. Abu as Saraya took Basra and
Wasit. Hasan sent Harthamah who inflicted several defeats on Abu as
Saraya.

to Babak's defeat and Mazyar's rebellion, as well as al
Mutasim's conquest of Ankara, etc. He omits mention of Sind,
Transoxania and the west, including Sicily. Also left out is
al Mu'tasim's continuation of al-Mamun's examination of
judges.

Al Mu'tasim demonstrated military skill, acquired Turkish

Abdallah ibn Tahir suppressed this rebellion. Mazyar was
brought to al Mu'tasim. There was evidence implicating al
Afshin in involvement because of al Afshin's wanting to
replace Abdallah ibn Tahir as Khurasan's governor. The
caliph provided for guests at al Afshin's son's wedding.
