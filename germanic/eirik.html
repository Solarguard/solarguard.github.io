EIRIK THE RED AND OTHER ICELANDIC SAGAS, transl. Gwyn Jones, Oxford
University Press, 1980 (1961)

The book begins with an introduction by the translator, noting the
hardy nature of the noble settlers of Iceland whose deeds were told
and later recorded.

   The long dark winters provided all the time in the world, the
   need to kill off most of their cattle ensured a large supply of
   week-old calves' skins for vellum, and the coming of Christianity
   in the year 1000 provided a practicable alphabet and a
   conventional format. p. x

Outlined is the extent of Icelandic literature, native and
translated, and its departure from absolute historical veracity.

   One of the most striking features of recent saga scholarship has
   been the dispassionate assessment of their historicity; many
   cherished beliefs have been ruthlessly overthrown, and many a
   fond prejudice painfully discarded. Thus, Hrafnkel the Priest of
   Frey, long celebrated as a record of fact, has been shown to be
   quite unhistorical--to be, in fact, a brilliantly realistic
   novella. p. xiii

Mentioned is Germanic heroic, appropriate behaviour and a few words
are said about the nine sagas selected for this volume.

Hen Thorir's Saga (pp. 3-38) starts with the peddlar Thorir, who
made money by his trading, although he was unpopular. He offered
half his money to foster Helgi, son of Arngrim the Priest. A ship
arrived in Borgarfjord, and they declined Odd Onundson'e offer to
set the price of the goods. Odd then forbade any to deal with them.
Blund-Ketil helped them out.

There was a poor harvest of hay. Blund-Ketil helped out some of his
farmers who had not slaughtered as many of their animals as he'd
suggested. Blund-Ketil even slaughtered some of his own and gave the
hay those horses would have eaten to his tenants. And, he went with
two men to ask Thorir for hay. Although he had the hay to spare,
Thorir was very reluctant to part with it. Blund-Ketil put down
money and took the hay anyway. When Thorir told others all his hay
had been stolen, Helgi told the truth and no sympathy was there for
Thorir.

Thorvald Tunga-Oddson sailed in and would not be disuaded from
backing Thorir. He rode out to Blund-Ketil's place and thought the
offer for the hay a generous one, but Thorir refused it. An arrow
was fired at Thorir's group, but it was Helgi who was struck. That
night Thorir burnt Blund-Ketil and his people in their house.

Thorbjorn, known as Strider and reputedly a wizard, was foster
father to Blund-Ketil's son Herstein who dreamt of the fire.
Thorbjorn and Herstein informed Odd and asked for his advice.

   Odd rode to the only one of the buildings which was not entirely
   consumed, reached for a birch rafter and pulled it off the house,
   and then rode widdershins round the house with the burning brand,
   crying out: 'I take this land here for my own, for I see no
   inhabited dwelling here. Let those witnesses who are hereby pay
   heed to it.' And finally he spurred his horse and galloped off.
   p. 20

Thorbjorn then moved the valuables to Thorkel Trefil. Then Thorbjorn
and Trefil went to see Gunnar Hlifarson and Thord Bellow and they
quickly had Herstein betrothed to Gunnar's daughter Thurid. At the
wedding, Herstein and Gunnar swore to have Arngrim and Thorvald
declared outlaws, but Thord wouldn't swear the same for Odd. Thorir
became very hard to find, but the others, accused and accusers,
gathered lots of men. There were a couple of clashes and an
arbitrated settlement that went against Odd. Thorir tried to
ambush Herstein, but Herstein spotted the ambushers and prevailed,
himself chopping off Thorir's head.

Those involved in the burning were declared outlaws, though Thorvald
only had to leave Iceland for three years. He became a slave in
Scotland. Thorodd asked Gunnar for the hand of Gunnar's daughter
Jofrid. Gunnar refused. Later Odd led a force against Gunnar, but
Thorodd got there first and his offer was accepted this time, and,
though Odd was far from pleased, there was a wedding instead of a
battle. Later Thorodd went to rescue his brother and neither of them
was seen again in Iceland. Odd aged and died. Jofrid married again,
this time Thorstein Egilsson.

The Vapnfjord Men's Saga (pp. 39-77), begins with Helgi, son of
Thorgils, son of Thorstein the White. When Helgi was young he fought
and slew Svart the sheep stealer. Helgi had a very close friend
Geitir Lytingsson. A man named Hrafn from Norway was killed at the
winter games. He had been staying with Geitir. Geitir and Helgi
divided his goods. Hrafn's shipmate Thorleif came while they were at
the Assembly and took Hrafn's goods to bring to Hrafn's kinfolk.
Geitir and Helgi were not pleased. Each thought Thorleif hadn't
taken all. Helgi thought Geitir had a box and Geitir thought Helgi
had a ring. Thorleif returned and settled on his farm.

   There was a women named Steinvor who was a temple-priestess and
   kept the head temple to which every householder must pay
   temple-tax, and this Steinvor came to see Brodd-Helgi because she
   was related to him, and told him her troubles, how Thorleif the
   Christian would not pay temple-tax like other men. Brodd-Helgi
   promised to look after the matter and pay her what she was due,
   and he took over from her the case against Thorleif. p. 47

Thorleif, though, was very hospitable. Helgi did not see that case
go anywhere. Helgi's wife Halla got old and ill. She offered to make
room for a younger woman. Helgi accepted an invitation from a young
widow named Thorgerd Silver and Halla went to her brother Geitir.
Geitir wanted her goods, but Helgi wasn't quick to hand them over.
Helgi then became involved in a dispute. He killed oxen, felled
trees and had men beaten and killed. He asked for the aid of
Gudmund, but then didn't pay Gudmund, thus losing his friendship.

Then Thorarin Egilsson arrived with a ship. He rebuffed an offer of
hospitality from Helgi and sent back five horses given him by Helgi.
When he returned from another voyage, he encouraged Geitir to stand
up to Helgi. Helgi was to travel to the Assembly with Geitir. Helgi
first went to see his foster-mother and she was weeping from her
prophetic dream of his death. Geitir rode out with eleven men, three
of them, Thorarin, Hallbjorn and Throst, sons of Egil.

Helgi's son Bjarni slew Tjorvi the Big, one of those who had killed
Helgi. Bjarni had gotten along with Geitir. However, Geitir spoke of
red clothes and later Thorgerd showed Bjarni the bloody clothes in
which Bjarni had died. Bjarni slew Geitir. Geitir's son Thorkel
returned from voyaging. He did not accept compensation. When Bjarni
prepared to go the mountains, Thorkel did, too. However, Thorvard
Leech warned Bjarni and Bjarni stayed home. Another time Thorvard
noticed Thorkel seeking the strength at Bjarni's place, told Bjarni,
conveyed to Thorkel's men news of a supposed large force at Bjarni's
and again peace continued. A third time Bjarni escaped by having a
block placed on his horse and it was this which Thorkel and eight
men chased.

On the way home from the Spring Assembly, Thorkel caught Bjarni at
Eyvindarstadir. Thorkel struck at Bjarni, but the blow hit a
necklace Bjarni's sister had insisted Bjarni wear. Eyvind and his
people arrived and threw clothes over the weapons to stop the
fighting. Four men had died on each side. Thorvard Leech healed
first the wounded on Bjarni's side and then Bjarni sent him to heal
Thorkel. Thorkel was watching a game of "chess" when Thorvard
arrived. The healer examined his wound and cured him. After that,
Bjarni offered to help out Thorkel when he was short of hay.
Thorkel's wife, Jorunn Einarsdottir, encouraged her husband to
respond and the feud was ended.

Thorstein Staff-Struck's Saga (pp. 78-88) begins with Thorstein
Thorarinsson getting his nickname when Thord, one of Bjarni's
servants, hit Thorstein with a staff during a horse fight. Thorarin
goaded his son. Thorstein went and asked Thord if it had been an
accident and otherwise to pay compensation. Thord mocked Thorstein.
Thorstein killed Thord. Bjarni had Thorstein proclaimed an outlaw.
Thorstein lived as before. Bjarni overheard two of his men, Thorhall
and Thorvald, mocking Bjarni for not acting on the matter. Bjarni
sent them against Thorstein. Thorstein killed them.

Bjarni's wife goaded her husband, who went to Thorstein. Thorstein
didn't want to fight him, offering to sail away. Bjarni insisted on
fighting. Thorstein fought so well and nobly, Bjarni said he'd
consider he's recompensed for the three servants, if Thorstein will
be true to him. Thorstein agrees.

"Hrafnkel the Priest of Frey" (pp. 89-125) centres on the oath this
priest swore, that he'd kill anyone riding his horse Freyfaxi. His
shepherd, Einar Thorbjornsson, rodes the horse and Hrafnkel killed
Einar. He was unusually repentant offering amazing compensation.

   I shall provide your household with milch cows in summer and with
   meat in the autumn, and I shall do this for you season by season
   as long as you want to keep on your farm. Under my management
   your sons and daughters shall be taken off your hands, and so
   endowed that they can make good matches as a result; while
   anything at all you know to be in my possession that you have
   need of from now on, you must tell me and never again go short of
   whatever it is you need. You shall keep on your farm as long as
   you please, but come here to me as soon as you grow tired of it,
   whereupon I will look after you to the day of your death. p. 97

Thorbjorn rejected this and had his cousin Sam take the case to law.
As Hrafnkel had a reputation of making short shrift of opponents in
court, it wasn't easy to find any to stand up to him. For the same
reason, Thorkel Thjostarsson wanted to oppose Hrafnkel. Thorkel
convinced his brother Thorgeir, who had a priesthood in the
Westfirths, to support Thorbjorn. Hrafnkel was outlawed, didn't take
it seriously, was taken at his place, but not killed. Against
Thorgeir's advice, Sam merely expelled Hrafnkel from his land. The
stallion Freyfaxi was killed. And:

   Lower down stood the temple which had belonged to Hrafnkel.
   Thorkel wanted to have a look at it. He had all the gods
   plundered, and then set fire to the temple, and burnt the whole
   lot together. p. 115

Hrafnkel went elsewhere, cut timber for a new house, and became more
prosperous and influential than before.

Sam's brother Eyvind returned from seven years abroad. He was seen
and pursued by Hrafnkel. Advised by his five men that he should
flee, he refused to run from one he had not harmed. Hrafnkel
attacked and killed Eyvind and Eyvind's men, losing a dozen men of
his own. Hrafnkel later surprised Sam, but spared his life.

   But Hrafnkel lived on his farm and kept his honours. He died of a
   sickness, and his burial mound stands in Hrafnkelsdal, down the
   valley from Adalbol. Great riches were laid on the mound
   alongside him, all his armour and that good spear of his. His
   sons succeeded to his authority, Thorir living at Hrafnkelsstadir
   and Ashbjorn at Adalbol. They shared the priesthood between them,
   and were reckoned very able men. pp. 124-125

Eirik the Red's Saga (pp. 126-157) begins with Olaf the White, who
took Dublin and was killed fighting in Ireland. His widow, Aud, and
his son, Thorstein, went to Scotland, where Thorstein fell in
battle. Aud went to the Orkneys where she found a husband for her
daughter Gro, later mother of Graelada, wife of Earl Thorfinn
Skull-Splitter. Aud sailed to Iceland.

Eirik the Red and his father, Thorvald, came to Iceland from Norway.
When Eirik asked for the return of his hall-beams, Thorgest, who had
them, would not give them up. A fight and killings ensued. Eirik was
outlawed and sought the land mentioned by Gunnbjorn Ulf-Krakuson. He
found it, stayed there three years, returned to Iceland and inspired
enthusiasm for the new land. Twenty-five ships set out and fourteen
arrived in Greenland.

Einar, son of Thorgeir, sought to marry Gudrid, Thorbjornsdottir.
Her father was not keen on the match. Thorbjorn decided to go to
Greenland. There was some rough weather. When he got there, Thorkel
took him in.

The next four pages are quoted here in full, though from another
translation:

<A HREF="eirik4.html">
Greenlandic seeress</a><p>

Leif Eiriksson went to Norway, where he was with King Olaf
Tryggvason. Leif had a son in the Hebrides and the boy later came to
Greenland. Leif's brother Thorstein married Gudrid, who had sung for
the seeress. Winter was hard with sickness and deaths. Thorstein
Eiriksson was among those who died.

Thorfinn Thordsson and Bjarni Grimolfsson sailed in two ships to
Greenland. They stayed at Eirik's place. There was a great Christmas
feast. Thorfinn married Gudrid. Thorfinn and Bjarni sailed west,
where they found Flatstoneland, Woodland and Wineland. It was a
rough winter and there was hunger. Thorhall went missing for three
days. They found him on a crag reciting a prayer to Thor. A whale
came in providing them with food.

Thorfinn and Bjarni sailed south and met Skraelings twirling rods
sunwise. This was considered a sign of peace and a white shield was
shown in response. There was trade. Then a bull emerged and scared
the Skraelings. They fled, returning three weeks later and twirling
rods against the sun. They attacked in such numbers and using slings
so fiercely that they drove the men off. However, when Fredis, a
pregnant woman, faced them with a sword they fled. Thorfinn sailed
south. A uniped slew Thorvald Eiriksson with an arrow. Two boys were
caught and taught Norse.

   They said that their mother's name was Vethildi and their
   father's Ovaegi. They said that kings ruled over the Skraelings,
   and that one of them was called Avaldamon and the other
   Avaldidida. There were no houses there, they said; the people
   lived in caves or holes. A country lay on the other side, they
   said, opposite their own land, where lived men who dressed in
   white clothes and carried poles, and were festooned with
   streamers, and whooped loudly. p. 156

Bjarni's ship in the Irish Sea began to sink. there was a boat
coated with seal-tar, impervious, thus, to worm. Lots were drawn and
one man, whose name is not worth recalling, wanted to live, so
Bjarni traded places with him in a manly gesture worthy of
remembrance.

"Thidrandi Whom the Goddesses Slew" (pp. 158-162) starts with the
Norwegian Thorhall the Seer, who refused to praise Sidu-Hall's son
Thidrandi, though everyone else did. Sidu-Hall planned a harvest
festival. Thorhall told him he feared a seer would die there.
Sidu-Hall said he planned to kill an ox called seer. Thorhall then
advised none to go out that night. All agreed. Then, that night
there came a knock. Thidrandi took a sword and went to the door.
He went out and saw nine women holding swords and nine others on
white horses. They are said to have slain Thidrandi as recompense
for the soon to come abandonment of the old religion.

"Arthan and the Bear" (pp. 163-170) describes Authan, who bought a
bear in Greenland and brought it by Norway's King Harald to
Denmark's King Swain. Swain gave Authan a ship, a purse full of
silver and a ring. Authan questioned by Harald told him of the gifts
and gave the ring to Harald.

"Gunnlaug Wormtongue" (pp. 171-217) begins with the Norwegian
Bergfinn arriving in Iceland and staying with Thorstein Egilsson.
Thorstein was displeased with Gunnlaug's interpretation of a dream
of Egil's, though I saw the same thing as soon as I read the dream
(the swan Egil had on his roof was Egil's daughter, the two eagles
who fought to the death over it were contending suitors, and the
falcon who flew off with the swan was the future husband of Egil's
daughter). The one thing I hadn't known was that the girl wasn't yet
born. Thorstein commanded his pregnant wife's child to be exposed if
it's a girl. Instead, the girl's mother sent her to be brought up
secretly at Thorstein's sister's place. When the girl was six,
Thorgerd told Thorstein that it is his daughter. So, Thorstein took
Helga home with him.

When Gunnlaug Wormtongue was twelve, he had a falling out with his
father and went to stay with Thorstein. Thorstein taught him law.
When Thorstein was eighteen, he got along better with his father,
who agreed to fit him out for a journey. Before he left, Gunnlaug
had his father ask Thorstein on Gunnlaug's behalf for Helga's hand.
Thorstein said she'd wait three years for Gunnlaug to come back
having made something of himself. Gunnlaug's tongue riled Earl Eirik
in Norway. Gunnlaug went to England and recited a praise poem to
King Ethelred. Thororm borrowed some money from Gunnlaug and refused
to repay it. Gunnlaug challenged him to fight on an island. King
Ethelred warned Gunnlaug that Thororm's eyes blunted swords and gave
Gunnlaug a sword to keep secret until the fight. This prevailed and
Thororm was slain.

Gunnlaug sailed to Dublin, where he recited a praise poem to King
Sigtrygg Silkbeard, who said no one had done that for him before.
Sigtrygg was very pleased and rewarded Gunnlaug richly. Gunnlaug
went then to the Orkney's, where Earl Sigurd Hlodvisson gave him an
axe for a praise poem. He went to Sweden and recited an appreciated
poem to Earl Sigurd. At Yule, he even umpired a dispute between
Norwegians and Swedes that pleased both. He went to King Olof and
met there the Icelander Hrafn Onundarson. Both recited praise poems
to Olaf the Swede.

Hrafn returned to Iceland and had his father ask Thorstein for the
hand of Helga. Thorstein replied that she was waiting for Gunnlaug.
Time passed without the appearance of Gunnlaug, so it was decided if
he did not appear before the beginning of winter, Hrafn would have
his wedding then. Gunnlaug had been in England, where they were
expecting Knut's invasion. At last, he returned. However, Hrafn
had married Helga much to her displeasure.

Gunnlaug challenged Hrafn to fight on an island. Hrafn struck the
first blow. His sword broke and nicked Gunnlaug on the cheek. This
was declared a wound and Gunnlaug, displeased, judged defeated.
There was then a vote to ban such island fighting. Later Hrafn
suggested they go to Norway to duel. They were forbidden to fight in
Norway. Hrafn proceeded towards Sweden with Gunnlaug travelling
after him. They met at Gleipnir's Fields. With the fine sword given
him by Ethelred, Gunnlaug cut Hrafn's legs. Gunnlaug brought
vanquished Hrafn water, but unmanly Hrafn then dealt him a death
blow. This despicable behaviour led to feuding back in Iceland.
Helga was married to Thorkel Hallkelsson, but still pined for
Gunnlaug till she died.

The book closes with the hundred page saga of Danish Hrolf. This is
