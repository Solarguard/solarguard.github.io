Michael McKenny's Ogham in Verse

The birch is first, the right receives a line.
Lil' baby born, advancing time is thine.
A bird is heard as dawns a newer day.
Resounds a horn announcing we're away.

Anchors are raised and breezes swell the sail.
The milk begins to splatter to the pail.
A hoe is forged and starts a lamb to bleat.
Begins a life, a while, a worthy feat.

The rowan, right receives another stroke,
A torch alight, attentive eyes awoke.
A guard's alert upon a lofty wall;
The watch is here and shouting out their call.

A shining mind unwinding binding knots,
Perceiving truths, a focused gaze that spots
The hiding places, facing forth aware,
Discerning how and knowing what is there.

The alder's third, a firm unyielding shield.
Onward, ahead in gale or battlefield.
A ship secure upon a stormy sea,
A safe, a forceful charge to victory.

Epona, Oghma guarding sure the land.
Let all rejoice and know they're here at hand,
Lat's cast away the fears of direst dread.
Let's feel assured and bravely step ahead.

Willow is fourth, a girl, a surging dream,
A leaping gleam, a feel, a swirling stream.
It's life around, the turning wheel we live.
Arising radiance intuitive.

It's bright, it's sight ashine in seer's mind.
It's light aflight, delight with finest find,
Vision revealing psychic paradigm
As surging tides, as mystic maritime.

The ash is fifth, a bridge above the world,
A flying steed with sweeping wings unfurled,
A key releasing doors to lofty keeps,
A means to soar upwards in bounding leaps.

A climb to Tir na n'Og as rung by rung
We rise aloft to stare at stars astrung,
To peer into the eyes of gods and bow
Perceiving reaches o'er the here and now.

With huath a swath leftward to form repose,
To heave an easing sigh, relief from blows.
It's time to rest, abide withdrawn a while,
To heal the wounds, regain vigor and smile.

A shelter strong, at night a flaming fire.
Secure inside a hold, relieved respire.
Whitethorn relaxes till the coming morn.
Action to come, but now our cares are shorn.

The oak, another stroke leftward is lord,
A royal liege, a leader wielding sword.
His heart is brave, his arm is sure and strong.
His mind is keen, his view is true and long.

As host he greets his guests with meet and mead.
His folk he knows, responds to each one's need.
In peace, at war he guides his people well.
Serene and roaring, chieftain, all can tell.

The holly calms extremes to moderate,
A central bole of tree, a balanced mate,
The scales of law equable, fair and just,
As trade, an honest deal that all can trust.

Along the Golden Mean, a reasoned walk.
It's good in food, in work, in play, in talk.
It's sleep as needed, being hale, in health.
It's knowing harmony's the highest wealth.

The hazel's fourth leftward, a forge gods fired,
Amazing blaze creating minds inspired,
Revealing treats that meet the timely test,
It paints resounding sounds that dance with zest.

The tubes of blue and red and green release
In more than mortal hand a masterpiece.
Beyond canvas and stone and words and tunes,
The coll's the call of gods, creative boons.

The queirt's a choice of joys, it's youthful love,
A smiling sun from happy heights above,
A harp that's played in halls of kings and elves,
Supreme the lays that please the gods themselves.

Let's taste the sweetest fruit, regard her face.
inhale the fairest rose. Let's feel, embrace
A girl and hear her say it's me she loves.
Let's choose the Youthful Isles and cooing doves.

The muin's a vine, a slanting warp and woof,
A tapestry to hang from future's roof,
A winding seed that's grown, a twining probe,
A garden gown, a verdant shining robe.

The joys received, injuring blows that pain
Conjoin as soil combined with sowing rain
Propelling growths, extending wide and high,
Embracing then and now, a thriving tie.

Ivy's a drum, a warning loud and clear
That danger's coming, looming doom is near.
Reflect at once, decide the way to ride,
To choose if safely you can race inside,

Or bravely whirl to face the foe's advance,
Or speech unsheathed allay the pointing lance.
Alarm, alert, on guard, beware. The drum
Advises danger's near, about to come.

The healing broom renews the wounded soul,
Allows the tired repose, becoming whole.
It sweeps away the piles of old refuse.
It makes a place for goods for future use.

Our body, home, our land, our minds, our lives
Acquired what's faded, now no longer thrives.
The broom's the sign the time to sweep arrived.
With waste removed there's room and good survived.

Blackthorn is fate, what's sure cannot escape,
A robe that comes, our choice the way we drape
What must be worn, the way we place our shoes
On paths we have to walk, cannot but choose.

Let's greet the change; let's ride the raging storm.
Let's feel the cleaning rain, remaining warm.
We move along. No choice a safe harbour.
Let's face the gale with courage and valour.

Elder is life, the turning wheel atwirl,
The falling leaves the seed of spring can hurl,
Revealed to all recalling cycling ways.
A babe will pace with cane in coming days.

The freshest life, the brightest spark will fade
As tool, as thought, as homestead mortal made
Will serve its use and cease to be of worth,
Will die away as comes a newer birth.

A line across, the peering pine perceives
Horizon's wide, lil' needles, furthest leaves.
We're fine receiving energizing flow.
Vigorous sight discerningly we know.

To rake inside our view the deeper roots,
Our ancient heritage, today's best fruits,
Emerging soon, distant, as planted seeds
Will surge above the ground answering needs.

The onn is gorse, a ranging honey flight,
Gathering tools, the goods, the books, the light.
It's search for people, ways and means to learn.
It's finding how and when and where to turn.

There's toil required and many tasks to do
Enduring hard and striving sure and true.
And onn's acquiring needed helping tools
Transforming dearth into radiant jewels.

Heather is romance, dream, ideal or real.
Designer's plans, heralds of things we feel,
It helps transform this world of ours, supports
Improving lives, inspires brilliant efforts.

Romance is more than failing now to cope.
The ur's a blur, a misty haze of hope.
Aware that all may not be what it seems,
Let's try to make substantial highest dreams.

The aspen cries, "Hurray!" We've gained the prize.
Just hear the crowds, the shouts, just realize
This triumph's ours. Against the odds we won.
We stand acclaimed beneath the smiling sun.

Edad salutes the goal that we achieved,
Unheeding cheers, rewards and wreaths received.
The greatest aims are often those that failed
To gain us praise and stay always unhailed.

Idad is soul, our whole from age to age,
Eternal yew, the true and central mage.
From life to life immortal we extend
Our tries as worthily we learn, ascend.

In flowing water, golden fire it cleans.
It reaches back, embracing through our genes,
And lives we lived before, pivotal keys,
Discerns ahead essential centuries.
