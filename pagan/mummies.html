THE MUMMIES OF URUMCHI, Elizabeth Wayland Barber, W.N. Norton and Company,
New York, 1999

This is a popular presentation by a textile enthusiast of some remains
found in the Tarim Basin of Western China.

Chapter One, "Mystery Mummies" (pp. 17-21), introduces the finds, the
remoteness and inhospitable nature of the region and questions posed by
the discovery of early Indo-European types in the same area as the later
Tokharan manuscripts.

Chapter Two, "A Man With Ten Hats" (pp. 23-45), mentions details
concerning clothing:

   By way of decoration on the plain-weave fabric, the tailor of Cherchen 
   Man's suit whipped bright red yarn as a sort of piping over the seams
   on both the shirt body and trouser legs and around the neck and front
   opening of the shirt. It produces a very subtle but effective
   ornamentation -- subtle both because the piping is so fine and because
   its bright red color rests against the purply-red-brown background. 
   p. 27
 
There is mention of preservation both of bodies and clothes, and
references are made to remains from Egypt and Peru. Phrygian style hats
are mentioned and Indo-European issues raised. Next comes the less
demanding herding lifestyle and the impact on herders of adverse climatic
conditions and the consequences for neighbouring settled agricultural
societies. There's a return to clothing and references to pants, sleeves
and reddish dye added to brown wool. Cherchen Man's face had been painted
with yellow ochre. The chapter closes with the introduction of Uyghur
archaeologist Dolkun Kamberi and reference to the dig at the cemetery near
Zaghunluq.

   The ancient burial ground of several hundred graves stretched for
   three-quarters of a mile in length and roughly half a mile in width
   (1.1 by 0.75 km). pp. 43-45

Chapter Three, "Plus Three Women and a Baby" (pp. 47-69), examines the
three women found in the same pit as Cherchen Man as well as the baby
(perhaps three months old or less) found in a nearby pit covered by a slab
of poplar.

   A pair of unusual gifts lay with the child: a small cow's horn cup and
   what may be the world's earliest preserved nursing bottle, fashioned, 
   nipple and all, from the udder of a sheep. p. 52

The baby had two blue stones over its eyes and was dressed in cloth like
that of the adults. There is consideration of cloth and techniques in
making it both here and in other sites, including at Pazyryk, five hundred
miles north of Urumchi, where there are kurgans with wood, permitting
dendrochronological dating from c. 480-430 B.C.E. The author ponders the
similarity of the Japanese cord-making technique kumihimo to products
found at Urumchi. She mentioned being informed that she has been able to
examine about one-fifth of the cloth at the museum. She reminds the reader
of the great problem of damage to archaeological sites from local treasure
seekers. She provides between pages 64 and 65 sixteen pages of plates,
demonstrating in brilliant colour the human, cloth and other subject
matter of her book. She states that there is no archaeological indication
that the Tarim basin had permanent settlement prior to 2,000 B.C.E.

Chapter Four, "The Beauty of Loulan" (pp. 71-87), begins with a look at
this woman and the technique of making her clothes, including her
"hoodlike woolen cap." (p.72)

   The four-thousand-year-old woman also possessed a neatly woven bag or
   soft basket. Inside it the archaeologists found some grains of wheat,
   and those who had laid her to rest had covered her head and chest with 
   a large, flat basket in the form of a winnowing tray, used to clean
   wheat of its chaff. p. 74

There's mention of wheat coming from the west; millet and rice lay to the
east. Another woman, similarily attired, and a child of about eight years
are mentioned. Next there's reference to burial custom and tomb
construction. 

   The ancient gravediggers laid out the corpse, wrapped in its cloak or
   shroud, full length in a pit in the sandy ground with the head pointing
   east. Usually they used small boards to form a sort of coffin, often
   lidless and always bottomless -- more like a low fence to hold back the
   restless sand long enough to lay the body in. After arranging a few
   gifts, such as a bag-shaped basket of wheat, a comb, or small bundles 
   of ephedra twigs, the burial party covered the corpse against
   predators, sometimes stretching hides or a broad winnowing basket over
   the top or laying a row of small planks crossways. Then they filled the
   pit. Such graves generally contain neither pottery nor metal. p. 81

There were other graves, more impressive, with a sun pattern of poles
marking them. However, as these were deeper they did not dry so fast and
hence decomposition was greater. The poles lead to the topic of the shift
of the river's course c. 330 C.E. and the resultant loss of vegetation
around the former Lop Nor. There has been apparently a series of such
movements of the river and the lake across the nearly level plain.

Chapter Five, "The Early Explorers" (pp. 89-108), begins by describing the
travels of Sven Hedin and Marc Aurel Stein. It discusses the linguistic
factors in Kroran perhaps being the original from which Prakrit derived
Kroraina and Chinese Loulan. It mentions Stein's find of remains similar
to more recent Urumchi mummies.

   He also remarks that one edge of the shroud had been formed into a
   pouch that held twigs of ephedra, a plant prized in both ancient and
   modern times for its stimulant properties. (Ephedra still provides an
   important asthma medicine, ephedrine. See Chapter 8.) Twigs of it also
   occurred in graves excavated in the 1980s at Qawrrighul. pp. 95-106

It refers to modern dating by radiocarbon and dendrochronology. It
mentions findsby Folke Bergman whose bringing of remains back to Sweden
led Vivi Sylwan to write her 1941 book WOOLEN TEXTILES OF THE LOU-LAN
PEOPLE. Her descriptions there lead to loincloths both in the Tarim and as
far west as the Celts.

Chapter Six, "Tokharians and Other Hairy Barbarians" (pp. 111-129),
introduces the concept of related languages, of the Proto-Indo-European
language and of the two Tokharian languages.

   Linguistically these twins show features lumping them most closely with 
   the westernmost Indo-European languages: Celtic and Italic, and to some
   extent Germanic. But they are not particularly similar to their nearest
   geographical neighbors, Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic (see fig. 6.3).
   This is all the more surprising because other Tarim Basin people in the
   first millennium A.D. were writing and speaking Indic and Iranian
   languages. And indeed, the twins have many loanwords from these
   neighbors. But their basic structure is neither Indic nor Iranian, nor
   that of any other Indo-European daughter group. the pair forms a
   separate branch of the tree and on the face of it, one that originally
   hobnobbed with the most westerly branches. pp. 115-116       

There's a look at Chinese accounts of the Yuezhi who had been powerful
until their defeat by the Hsiang-nu in the 2nd C.B.C.E. when the Yuezhi
king contributed his head as a drinking glass and his son moved to Daxia
(Bactria), whence the Chinese envoy Zhang Qian found him unwilling to take
up old eastern conflicts. There's some linguistic discussion, such as
Indo-European words in Chinese, for example, the Kunlun Mountains coming
from Tokharian klyom or klyomo, likely cognate with Latin caelum.

   Our Tokharian manuscripts consist mainly of random scraps of translated 
   Buddhist literature and shreds of local business dealings -- not a good
   cross section of the total vocabulary, But we do have a few relevant
   terms, including a clearly Indo-European word for "weaver" (wawattsa or
   wapattsa, cognate with English weave, web -- see fig. 6.4). So we know
   the Tokharians came to the Tarim Basin with an ancient knowledge of
   weaving. p. 128

Chapter Seven, "Hami and Hallstatt" (pp. 131-145), looks at the remains of
the fair haired people of this important oasis area some three hundred
miles east of Urumchi. The plaid garments are reminiscint of the Celts.

   For Tokharian shares more linguistic features with Celtic than with any 
   other branch. Since the similarity extends to textile technology too, 
   the case warrants careful investigation. In fact it was this puzzle
   that had drawn me to Chinese Turkistan in the first place. p. 133

She distinguishes relatively modern tartan design from Celtic plaid twills
dating from at least the early first millennium B.C.E. I got a little
Sliders' twitch when I read her assertion:

   Much of Caesar's fame and power, in the first century B.C., came from
   subduing Gaul and southern Britain and annexing them to the Roman 
   Empire. p. 135

She says she didn't see much Hami material and what she did see, though
quite similar to finds from Hallein, varied from Hallstatt cloth. This
similarity is shared by a find at Tsarskaya in the Caucasus, near the
generally believed PIE homeland. This chapter has an appendix commenting
on looms.

Chapter Eight, "The Oasis Hoppers and Their Kin" (pp. 149-167), begins by
mentioning the inhospitable nature of the area and the difficulty of
accessing archaeological reports before perestroika. She mentions American
participation in 1989 at the dig at Gonur Depe, differences in procedures
(horizontal versus vertical) and the indication:

   that people of a single Early Bronze Age culture had begun to spread
   across the oases of Russian Turkistan two or three centuries before
   2000  B.C., -- moving from southwest to northeast -- that is, headed
   directly toward the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges and (if one could get
   over those huge hurdles) the Tarim Basin. p. 151

There's consideration of routes into the Tarin basin and the ease, or
rather difficulty, of moving in with sheep. And, there's a look at the
significance of ephedra in the burials and the whole issue of the sacred
drink haoma (Persian) or soma (Sanskrit) and the suggested use of ephedra
with an hallucinogen, the ephedra being taken to stay awake for the
journey into the overworld.

Chapter Nine, "Pulses in the Heart of a Continent" (pp. 169-194), begins
by mentioning the current inhospitable nature of the Tarim Basin, varying
conditions since the last Ice Age and the existence of archaeological
sites requiring not jeeps, but helicopters and global positioning
equipment. There's a quick look at human evolution and the development of
language and the concept of some areas as linguistic "spread zones" and
others as "residual zones."

   The great spread zones include, for example, Mesoamerica, the South
   Pacific islands, part of sub-Saharan Africa (accounting for the recent
   spread of Bantu languages there), and -- the most famous, perhaps the
   most active spread zone of all -- the central Eurasian steppes...
   p. 184

She lists Indo-European, Hungarian, Turkic and Mongol pulses from the
steppes. She enters the PIE homeland controversy by stating:

   The proto-Indo-Europeans must have lived east of the Dneipr River (map
   7.6, 9.9) -- must, because they did not know of an important tool that
   developed in Central Europe from 5500 B.C. on: the warp-weighted loom.
   As one moves east, the Dneipr is where the archaeological evidence for
   that tool stops. Those Indo-Europeans who ended up farthest to the
   south  and east used other looms, and those who ended up west of the
   Dneipr borrowed from other languages all the words to do with the
   warp-weighted loom. So they could hardly have spent the Neolithic
   living right there in Central Europe, where it was invented. p. 191

The chapter closes with a mention of DNA analysis expected to play a
greater role in 21st Century archaeological research.

Chapter Ten, "Sands of the Silk Road, Sands of Time" (pp. 197-214), begins
by mentioning more recent burials than those previously the focus of the
book. There are some from 700 B.C.E. and later at Turfan.

   ...a second man displayed the most interesting sewing job yet dug up in
   the Tarim basin. He had undergone chest surgery, and the two incisions
   were sewn up with horsehair. p. 200

Then comes the linguistic correspondence of magic, magi and myag.

   Ancient Chinese myag denoted powerful individuals at the Chinese courts
   who according to Mair's researches, "were primarily responsible for
   divination, astrology, prayer, and healing with medicines" -- pretty
   much the same list of specialties that the magi had. p. 201

There's mention of the Iranian origin of the Old Chinese word for chariot
and of Tarim burials of horse skulls and legs. There's a survey of the
contact between Persia and the West, including the invasion by Alexander
the Great and the Hellenization of the Central asians, including the
Tokharoi (Yuezhi) and the fusion of Buddhist and Hellenic styles into the
Gandharan. There's comment on the stimulus of cross-cultural
interaction. There's reference to the Silk Road and the import of Roman
glass into Han China. The author mentions the accounts of Marco Polo and
the doubts some people have, due to errors he made and things they feel he
ought to have mentioned ("Chinese calligraphy, the Great Wall of China,
tea drinking, bound feet, or a host of other things..." p. 210), whether
he actually made the trip into China. The book closes by noting the
continued presence of Caucasians in the Tarim Basin.

Besides the striking coloured plates, there are some two dozen maps. The
book is written in a popular style. I could have done without the 1000
B.C.E. Tarim Times and the rubies in the cereal, but, even I must admit
the diagrams of the spider effectively convey the meaning of plain weave,
twill and long hop twill. This work is an interesting contribution to
those interested in PIE, Central-Asian, textile and archaeological
studies.
