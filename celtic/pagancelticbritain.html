<center>PAGAN CELTIC BRITAIN</center><p>

Anne Ross, Academy Chicago Publishers, 1996 (1967)<p>

On page 25 of this book the author opines, 

<blockquote>An ability to handle the
Celtic languages is fundamental in attempting any real appreciation of the
oblique, indirect, circular approach of these peoples to art, literature,
religion and social transactions.</blockquote>

<p>The highly problematical nature of this lengthy text is largely
connected with the discrepency between the impressions it conveys and the
content communicated to one very carefully considering her actual words. 

<p>One of the clearest and one of the most common examples of this is
her non-standard use of the word "Cult". On page 27 this is introduced as
follows, 

<blockquote>Patterns and a certain fundamental order can be seen to emerge
from the complex system of Celtic religious thought, and this study is an
attempt to define certain of these patterns, or 'cults' as it is more
convenient to describe them, as the evidence suggests they occurred in the
British Isles at the turn of the Christian era and in the centuries of
Roman domination.</blockquote>  

<p>Pages 94 to 171 constitute a chapter entitled "The
Cult of the Head". My translation reads, "Among British archaeological 
remains attributed to the Celtic and Romano-Celtic periods are human heads
and the representations thereof."

<p>A further example begins with her statement at the top of page 108:
"Tricephaloi are rare in Britain. Such examples as there are, however, are
impressive." Most of the page is then taken up with a discussion of one:

<blockquote>Found in an antique shop in Glasgow, and reputed to have come from
Sutherland...It is of coarse grained granite, which does not seem to be of
Scottish origin. This would rule out Sutherland as its place of origin
although it may well have found its way there from the Continent at the
time of the Roman occupation of Gaul, or during Viking times. (p. 108)</blockquote>

<p>She then proceeds to consider one from Corleck, County Caven in Ireland,
followed by another tricephalos found, along with a single head, from County
Donegal in the same country. And she continues with one from the Isle of
Guernsey. Next she offers us, "Another head which may have had four rather
than three faces...recovered from Wroxeter" (p. 110) and, "A similar
independent single head." (p. 110) Then we have the representation on the
slab from Risingham, Northumberland, "Dedicated by the Fourth Mounted
Cohort of Gauls." (p. 110) She concludes, "The above are the only
tricephaloi so far recovered from the British Isles which are early in
date." (p. 111) She then proceeds with mention of one from Wales, "Of
uncertain date," (p. 111) and one from Ireland which, "Must, on stylistic
grounds, be placed within the fully Christian period." (p. 112) She has
presented us with four pages of fascinating text whose opening I translate,
"We can confirm no tricephaloi from the Pagan Celtic British."

<p>This author has placed in her book a number of conceivably contradictory
statements. For example, in her section on the druids, she wrote both:

<blockquote>Caesar states that the Druidic order allegedly originated in Britain and
was transferred to Gaul at a later date, while those who wished to study
it in greater detail were in the habit of going to Britain in order to do
so, (P. 81)</blockquote> 

<p>and, 

<blockquote>It is noteworthy that the only reference to the 
Druidic priesthood in Britain is that made by Tacitus in his description
of the attack of Paulinus on Anglesey in AD 61. (p. 83)</blockquote> 

<p>She even adds,
"Caesar passes no comment on the insular Druids." (p. 83)

<p>On pages 81-82 she comments on the lack of convincing evidence from
the vernacular literature for belief in reincarnation, though on page 308,
referring to "The Wooing of Etain," she writes, "...To whom she had been
married in an earlier existence."

<p>One of the principal aspects for the comprehension of this study is
the ever constant requirement for the reader to differentiate between the
information presented and the author's opinions. This is not a remark
about how reasonable her guesses seem; there remains a need for awareness
of what in the book is objective data and what is subjective, "Inference"
derived from this data.
     
<p>For example, in her section on swans, she speculates, 

<blockquote>The evidence
strongly suggests that this bird was especially connected with the solar
cults which were widespread in Europe, and can be traced from the Bronze
Age, into the Iron Age, certain of the motifs eventually being
incorporated into early Christian iconography. (p. 302)</blockquote> 

<p>She proceeds, 

<blockquote>To
[...] suppose a propitiation of a god or gods whose functions were primarily 
concerned with the sun, especially in its therapeutic capacity. (pp. 301-
302)</blockquote>

<p>Alert now to these aspects related to the comprehension of this book,
let's take a look at its content.

<p>The author in her introduction expresses her hope her incomplete
listing of British archaeological remains may provide a framework for
future and more extensive work. She mentions the other two sources
complementing her focus on archaeology, the, "Surprisingly accurate," 
(p. 24) Classical references and, "The vernacular literatures." (p. 25) She
states that most artifacts have not survived, "And that most of the direct
evidence for native cults comes from Roman contexts." (p. 26) She cautions
against much earlier writing on the topic. She writes, "For some
archaeologists the world" (sic) "CELT has an ethnological significance,"
and, 

<blockquote>The two concepts can, however, be correlated to demonstrate that
what we mean by Celtic from the linguistic viewpoint is applicable to what
we mean by Celtic from the ethnological angle. (p. 33)</blockquote> 

<p>She feels the
main features of the later Celtic societies originated in the Urnfield
culture of c. 1300-700 BC. She mentions the Hallstatt and La Tene periods,
the Celtic migrations, the expansion of Rome, Irish as a Q-Celtic language
and present, "Very incomplete knowledge of Celtic archaeology in Ireland."
(p. 41)
     
<p>In Chapter One, "Sanctuaries, Temples and Cult Sites," she comments
on the sanctity of waters, opining that some names of rivers in Britain
may be connected with goddesses. Although, "In Britain positive
archaeological evidence for temples situated at the sources of rivers is
lacking," (p. 48) she infers them. She mentions no archaeological remains 
from lakes on the island of Britain. She does refer to remains in a lake on
Anglesey (Mona), opining a connection between these and the Roman attack in
61 CE. She mentions ritual shafts, including one whose hazel leaves and
nuts remind her of the connection of the hazel in Celtic mythology to
sacred wells. She adds, 

<blockquote>In Roman times, certain native votive springs were
patronized by the incomers, and, as in, for example, the case of Bath,
distinguished by the erection of sophisticated buildings in which both
native and intrusive deities were worshipped. (p. 56)</blockquote> 

<p>She proceeds to consider the sanctity of trees and groves, mentioning the names 
"Vernemeton," 'the especially Sacred Grove,'" and, "Medionemeton," 'the
Middle Sanctuary'" (p. 63) on Britain. She mentions grave sites, "Little or 
no trace of temple structures." (p. 66) The sanctuary at Heath Row, "Was
found to have had a wooden prototype of pre-Roman Iron Age," (p. 70) and
there was, "A shrine at Frilford." (p. 70) She moves on to consider 
Romano-Celtic temples and then the Druids, 

<blockquote>No matter what their function
and status was in the pre-Christian period, they figure in the post-
Christian literatures in the role of wise men, shape-shifters, 
prognosticators. (pp. 78-79)</blockquote> 

<p>As for archaeological evidence for British
druids, "Not one single piece of iconography or epigraphy commemorates them
with certainty." (p. 83)
     
<p>Chapter Two, "The Cult of the Head", mentions, "The discovery of
Mesolithic skull groups in a cave at Ofnet, Bavaria" (p 95), early,
"Skulls from Jericho, adorned with pebbles and shells" (p. 95), and,
"Etruscan burial urns on which an ornament in the form of a human head was
affixed." (p. 96) She refers to, 

<blockquote>Skulls from Bredon Hill and Stanwick,
their positions suggesting that they were attached to poles at the gate or
on the gate-structure itself. (p. 99)</blockquote>

<p>Some pre-Celtic burial sites include representations of the human
head. Heads also appear on British Celtic coins and some British Celtic
masks have been found. We can confirm no tricephaloi from the Pagan
Celtic British. "An impressive janiform head was recovered from the Roman
supply depot at Corbridge, Northumberland." (p. 113) Some heads are
represented with horns, some crudely, some, "Bear a resemblance to the
Classical Gorgon or Medusa heads" (p. 125), and some heads are placed on
stone pillars, some on, "Tiles, attached to the eaves of buildings" 
(p. 134), some on pottery and some in wells. Heads also feature in the 
vernacular literatures, where sometimes they speak or even sing.

<p>Chapter Three considers "The Horned God." "Here our particular
concern lies in the representations of horn-bearing, anthropomorphic
deities." (p. 176) Although, she does not clearly confirm such for the 
British Celts, she does refer to survivals from elsewhere and other times.
For example, She tells us that a single incomplete inscription from Paris 
above an antlered god, "Reading -Ernunnos-" (p. 180) provides the name
Cernunnos.

<blockquote>The Corinium relief shows the stag-god in traditional, squatting
posture. A most unusual feature of the portrayal is the way in which the
ram-serpent attributes are portrayed. They are not represented as separate
entities, having an existence and a significance independent of the
anthropomorphic god, but actually substitute the legs of the deity,
growing from his body, bending into a squatting posture, in place of his
lower limbs, and then rearing up to terminate in large ram-horned heads,
close to either side of the god's face, tongues protruding. [...] A
second unpublished representation of the stag-god, this time portrayed as
an antlered head, also comes from Corinium. (p. 185)</blockquote>

<p>She considers others
and also examines evidence from Ireland, including material from the
traditional literature, whence she opines a connection between Conall
Cernach and Cernunnos.

<p>She states the animal symbols of the horned god to be, "The serpent
and the ram, often composite...the stag and the bull." (p. 198) She
discusses his connection to material prosperity, to war, "As a protector
of the herds and flocks" (p. 205) and to hunting.

<p>Chapter Four, "The Warrior God in Britain", considers epigraphic and
iconographic, "Evidence for the war god in Britain." (p. 222) A number of
such gods are named and examined in the chapter. These include: Cocidius,
Teutates, "Invoked at Barkway in Herfordshire as MARTI TOUTATI" (p. 225),
"Loucetius, "Invoked at Bath" (p. 228), but, "Clearly an import from Gaul."
(p. 228) and Belatucadros, "Confined to Cumberland and Westmorland." 
(p. 235) Many and diverse are representations of, "The god likened to Mars
being represented now wearing a helmet, now bear-headed, having long and
curling hair." (p. 239) Some show him mounted. 

<blockquote>The classical Mars is
never depicted as a rider, whereas the native gods in Gaul equated with
Mars are especially concerned with horses, and are sometimes portrayed on
horseback. (p. 244)</blockquote> 

<p>She connects the function of healing to the warrior
god and discusses healing springs, including Bath.

<p>Chapter Five, "The Goddesses", mentions the significant difference
between Celtic deities and many other pantheons. 

<blockquote>For example, there is no
trace of a Celtic goddess of love, but all the goddesses share in having
marked sexual characteristics, and no matter what their individual
departments of influence sexuality and maternity are their fundamental
concerns. (p. 265)</blockquote> 

<p>She refers to the Celtic inclination to triplicate
manifestations of a deity. She looks at the goddess with and without
consort. She mentions the difficulty in determining the Celtic nature of
deities, "Expressed in fully classical representational form." (p. 277)
She discusses various goddesses, including those who are not exclusive to
Britain.  

<p>Chapter Six, "Sacred and Magic Birds", does include the caution,
"Once again, in this aspect of Celtic religion as elsewhere, the tentative
and fragile nature of the evidence must not be underestimated." (p. 302)
She supposes, "A god or gods whose functions were primarily concerned with
the sun, especially in its therapeutic capacity." (p. 302-303) She infers
a connection here with healing waters and aquatic birds such as: "The
swan, the crane and the goose." (p. 303) She envisions processions in
which live birds accompanied the image of the deity. She discusses swans
bearing chains and suggests a solar connection. She states there are no
traces of a raven goddess in Britain musing that, 

<blockquote>The obvious association
of this goddess with druidism and magic, and her powers as a prophet of
evil may have caused her immediate suppression, in company with the native
priesthood at the very beginning of the Roman campaigns in Britain.
(p. 315)</blockquote> 

<p>On page 321 she states that there is no evidence for a raven god 
in Britain. She proceeds to comment on birds as omens in early and in more
modern times. She refers to supernatural birds, hostile and friendly. She
mentions various kinds of birds: geese, owls, eagles, cranes and their
appearance in the vernacular literatures, folklore and elsewhere, e.g.
Athena's association with the owl.
     
<p>Chapter Seven, "Divine Animals", mentions the ease of theorizing,
horned gods, cats, bulls ("A legend concerning the hunting and slaying of
a bull is lacking from the vernacular tradition." p. 384 "Over and above
the bull-horned gods, bulls do not play an important roll in Romano-
British iconography." p. 385), boars,

<blockquote><i>Unlike the stag, the bull and the
water birds, it does not figure to any extent as a cult animal in proto-
Celtic contexts, but when the Celtic cultures emerge from their Bronze Age
background, it is seen to be the animal which has the greatest
representational popularity, and one which is used in a wide variety of
contexts. p. 390</i></blockquote> 

<p>horses with the association to Epona, stags connected
to Cernunnos, dogs and Cu Chulainn, rams, 

<blockquote><i>Although the ram does not
figure to any extent in the early literary tradition, the representational
evidence indicates that it was a beast of some considerable cult
importance and with a long ancestry in Indo-European religious symbolism...
In insular tradition...the ram shows few traces of the original cult
significance with which it must have been imbued. pp. 429-430</i></blockquote> 

<p>bears
("The cult can now only be inferred." p. 435), hares ("The number of
actual examples is limited." p. 435) and fish. (It appears in connection
with the god Nodons in the temple at Lydney Park on the Severn, and occurs
as a symbol on Pictish stones p. 437)

<p>Chapter Eight, "Aspects of Native Cults in North Britain", informs
the reader: 

<blockquote>The ACTUAL evidence for native cults is slight. Consequently
a high proportion of the conclusions ultimately reached must be based on
inference rather than stemming from factual sources. (p. 448)</blockquote> 

<p>Referring
the reader to Sir Cyril Fox's PATTERN AND PURPOSE, "For a general
discussion of the northern school of insular Celtic art" (p. 482) she
mentions a terret, a, "Fitment for a bucket handle" (p. 451), a couple of
buckets, place names, vernacular literatures, the northern deities
(Brigantia, Maponus, Belatucadros ("The two traditions, epigraphic and
iconographic, are never united, and none of the representations of these
undeniably local gods has the name of BELATUCADROS attached to it" p. 466),
Cocidius, Vitiris, Mogons and other deities evidenced in the North, though
possibly also worshipped elsewhere.

<p>This book is a fascinating consideration of British archaeological
remains of the Pagan Celts. It also draws on the other two chief sources
of evidence. the reader, however, is easily left with impressions that
vary from the precise meaning of the text and needs to be alert to the
prevalance of opinion within its pages.
