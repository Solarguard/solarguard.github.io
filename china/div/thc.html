<h2>The Elemental Changes (T'ai Hsuan Ching)</h2>

Yang Hsiung, transl. Michael Nyland, SUNY, Albany, 1994 (2 BCE)<p>

<p>At some point it is hoped a more complete consideration of this text
will be prepared for this site. For now, a few salient characteristics
are listed. 

<p>The author has transformed the 2 to the power of 6 nature of the I CHING
into a 3 to the power of 4 system. In place of the hexagrams of the I
CHING Yang Hsiung's CLASSIC OF THE GREAT MYSTERY offers the reader
tetragrams. More interestingly, he has added to the basic yin/yang
duality. He presents man between earth and heaven. Thus, in place of the
64 hexagrams of the I CHING there are 81 tetragrams.

<p>This edition includes a translation of the head text, the nine
appraisals and the nine fathomings of each tetragram, as well as of the
separate autocommentaries. It also contains rich explanatory material by
Michael Nyland. In effect he has commented extensively on each tetragram
and he has some two dozen pages of interesting introduction, including
comments on the background of the work, the life of its author and
divinatory details. 

<p>This is an amazing work and one, because of its numerological resonance,
very worthy of attentive consideration by Celtic diviners.<p>
