Chapter Two Morning

Very lazily I drifted awake. Very tranquilly I emerged from restful
sleep. I lay there for a moment as the sun shown down at me through
the open window to the left of the head of the bed. I always sleep
facing the rising sun. I did my stretching exercises, as I let my
mind scan my surroundings to ensure that all was well. It took a
full third of a second to determine that, both physically and
psychically, I was alone in my appartment, as I should be, that the
other residents of the building were all at their normal stages of
sleeping or stirring for school or work and that outside it seemed
to be a perfect autumn day.

There was no evidence of any unusual psychic activity. Memory, of
course, offered me, in greater detail than verbally he'd been able
to provide, Kevin's dream, as well as the telephone conversation
which had followed it. My mind began to grapple with the various
ramifications of this problem. I decided to wait for my walk across
the bridge before sharing this news with the Council of Wizards.

As I sat down to breakfast, I was delighted by the brightness of the
morning sun shining in the kitchen window. A curious shiver ran up
my spine, as a thought flitted through my mind. The thought was
simply that this quiet moment was a recompense for all the hardship
that lay ahead. Was that a true precognition or was that just my
unconscious playing games with me because I had judged this serious
enough for contacting my colleagues, but not quite urgent enough to
do so at once? Time would tell.

It felt odd trying to perform calmly the morning food ritual with
such agitation swirling around in my recent memory. Still, I ate
reverently, according to our custom, an enjoyable, but sparse
breakfast. The food was Terran, just a bowl of instant porridge and
a glass of milk. However, my body wore a Terran appearance, not that
there was any really significant difference. Their lungs, heart and
blood circulation system were a bit less effective than ours.
Externally, their ears were less rounded and lacked voluntary
filters. They, like us, came in a variety of skin pigmentations,
but Desert brown was our only overlap. I wore pale pink, instead of
my normal Forest green. I also lacked a finger on each hand.

When I'd finished, I grabbed from the fridge the lunch I had made
the night before, put it in my backpack with several books and
headed out the door for the elevator and outside.

The cool morning air felt good. As I set off towards the university,
I inhaled deeply and basked my eyes in the marvellous shades of
crimson and gold that make fall here so beautiful. As I made my way
towards the canal, where I'd send the message to the Council, I let
my mind relax by reviewing the work we would be doing for the first
class. This was Livy's history of the early days of Rome. There is
no more useful cover for an interplanetary observer than that of a
university student. Who else is so ubiquitous in a large Terran
city, has access to a great library and is expected to be seeking
out all kinds of interesting information?

I was quite keen to study the early languages and cultures, though
that is not very fashionable here these days, when everyone, or
almost everyone, is so intent on the very latest advances in science
and technology. They are all raving about the Internet and the
information highway, so concerned about where they are going they
forget that in very large measure they are defined by the lives
that lie behind them.

However, maybe this was just one of my own prejudices. Things were
much more stable back home. There, too, one of my chief interests
was a deep study of the earliest records and societies. I still 
think there's a lot of sense in studying the roots and youthful
growth of human history and civilization.

After about ten minutes, I began to cross the bridge over the canal.
I let the blue water below and the azure sky above serve as a focus
for my thoughts, as I began to reach telepathically for Blue. I
visualized this water, now before my physical eyes, as the splendid
waves of the Sea of Yattashdor, as they come lapping the shore below
the wooded hills in which she resides in her comfortable cave. I
felt the image in my memory taking on a more substantial form as my
mind merged with the reality of the spot where she dwells and then
with the Wizard of Blue herself.

Suddenly, there appeared clearly before my mind's eye her long blue
gown, her fair features and deep blue eyes. I mentally called to
her, as though I were standing right beside her and not on a distant
planet. "Blue," I projected.

"Green?" came her reply. "What's wrong?" she asked at once. One
doesn't send an unscheduled interplanetary telepathic message unless
something is wrong.

"Don't worry," I answered. "I'm in no immediate danger, and it may
turn out to be nothing. However, someone I know here, though not
very well, disturbed me a few hours before dawn with a dream, which
seems to be based on fact. First, this dream imposed itself over my
scheduled nightly memories. Then, on awakening, the Terran became
aware of me and phoned me. Make ready to receive a relatively
distressing mental record."

"Ready," came her instantaneous reply. At once I transmitted the
complete memory I had of the dream and the telephone conversation
following it.

"Received," she projected. "I'll communicate this to the rest of the
Council, and we'll be in touch, probably within a day's time."

"Good. All the best."

"The same to you. And, Green, just in case this is as serious as it
looks, or even more so, take care."

"Don't worry, Blue. I'll try to be careful."

All this had occurred with the normal rapidity of a brief telepathic
exchange. And, even during the step I took while conversing with her
part of my mind was continuing to enjoy the sight of the water in
the canal and the brilliant colours of the leaves and the green
grass on the bank beyond. I continued my walk reaching the end of
the bridge and proceeding onto the university grounds, up the long
path to the buildings and past several of those buildings, until I
came to the two dozen storey tower in which the Latin historians
class was being held.

I didn't even bother to check the elevators. These were habitually
so crowded at this time that I would most likely be late if I joined
the mob waiting in front of them. The class was being held on the
fourth floor, nothing like the distance up to the departmental
offices on the twentieth. So I walked at a relaxed pace behind some
other students, who had the same idea, up the stairs. I was the only
one, though, who proceeded to the room in which the Latin class was
being held.

There were three people already there, including Kevin. I slid into
a seat beside his. I could see that he looked quite haggard, as if
he had not slept since we had last chatted on the phone, in the
early hours of the morning.

"Greetings," I said.

"Hello," he replied.

I smiled and said, "You look like you were studying Livy very hard
this morning."

"And, of course you know that it wasn't Livy that I was studying. I
wanted to see whether..." He broke off, realizing that we were
hardly having a private chat. The room, which was not really that
large, was now quickly filling with stragglers. At exactly five
minutes after the hour the prof swept in carrying his copy of the
text book and several sheets of notes. These he tossed down onto his
desk. He stepped away from them and began to speak.

"Now, as I'm sure everyone remembers, last time we covered the
prologue, which contains Livy's own statements as to why he is
writing his monumental work, and why he prefers to be writing the
early history of Rome as opposed to accounts of his own day. This
led us into a brief review of how the ancients saw history." With
half my mind, I was fully aware of what he was saying. With the
other half, though, I had found something very interesting to
investigate. There was one other member of the class who was deeply
interested in the supernatural, or at least one aspect of what is
popularly known as New Age. This was a guy called Philip, who was a
devotee of an Indian guru. Usually, he was very relaxed, the result
of the efforts he took to follow the guru's method of meditation.

This morning, however, I could read that Philip's mind was distorted
and disturbed. On any other day I might have just shrugged and
assumed his rich parents, the same ones who were paying for him to
get a Classical education, had given him a hard time about being a
member of a cult, or something else of similar banal normality,
however stressful it may have been for Philip. Yet, because of the
extra care I was taking today, I made the point of going after his
mind's surface impressions. There was something there.

Philip retained a very vivid memory of the nearly traumatic
experience he had endured while trying to meditate this morning. I
followed the memory swiftly from the time exactly at dawn, he had
sat down in the lotus position, facing the rising sun, started to
chant his personal mantra, altered his breathing and then tried to
visualize the light and his guru's face. There had been an initial
partial success as, for an instant, this had seemed to be just
another normal morning meditation. Then suddenly the image he had in
his mind's eye of the guru misted over and faded, rather like a TV
screen, capturing just the ghostly image of an extra channel one
hasn't paid for. Suddenly, he had been startled as very clearly, a
frightening leering face thrust itself onto the pseudo-screen of his
mind. The face could not by any stretch of the imagination be called
human.

This terrifying vision had only lasted a second or so, after which
Philip had fainted. Yet, it had remained with him ever since, and
was still gnawing away at his composure and sanity.

I knew that what I was seeing in his mind was only his perception,
and as such it was very subjective. Still, even if this bore little
resemblance to anything real, physical or otherwise, it bore a
strikingly similar psychic impression to the unseen terror in
Kevin's dream.

I decided to act. Very swiftly, I slipped further into Philip's mind
and made the slight adjustments necessary to copy for him his memory
of yesterday's meditation and erase the unpleasant one from this
morning.

"Mr. Green," said the professor, "perhaps you would like to share
with the rest of us how you think the next passage may best be
translated into English." I had thought I had done a good job of
following what the professor was saying and in keeping my features
from revealing that I was up to something else. I allowed the
slightest touch of his thoughts, just enough to assure me that this
was a complete coincidence.

"Yes, sir," I said, though I had no intention of actually rendering
the passage into the rhythmic and exact translation which I really
believed was the best possible in his native language. "Oh, 
something like 'Turnus, the king of the Rutuli to whom Lavinia had
been engaged before the arrival of Aeneas...'"

And so the class proceeded. I noticed with satisfaction that when
the prof asked him to translate a passage, Philip spoke with no sign
that there was anything at all wrong, as indeed there wasn't, any
more. He even joined us a couple of times in discussing points of
grammar, literature and history. I could breathe more easily, at
least with regard to him.

I found this class absorbing, and one of the benefits of being here
this morning was that I picked up a few interesting surface thoughts
from the professor's mind about THE AENEID and early Roman religion.
I filed these for future followup, and hoped that I'd be able to get
to them soon, with nothing out of the ordinary occurring to
interfere with that.

It seemed no time at all before the professor glanced at his watch
and said, "Well, I guess that's all for today. How about just
working forward for the next class? You can do as much as you're
able, but you ought to be able to do at least three pages." It was
phrased as a request. However, he was clearly not inviting any
comment other than an affirmative. We all nodded dutifully. He said,
"Fine, see you all then," and started for the door.

Kevin looked at me and said, "Green, how about checking that
reference I mentioned last night?" It was clear, even without
reading his mind, that he wanted to talk and what he wanted to talk
about.

"Good idea," I said. "Why don't we take the stairs to be quicker."

"Sure, and it might not be so crowded." He meant that we might be
able to talk freely. However, there were others also taking the
stairs, so we still chatted only about ordinary things, until we got
outside and had found a spot on the grass not far from the library.
This set us a bit apart from those sitting on the long stone
backless bench closer to that building.

It was a pleasant fall day, so pleasant in fact that I found it a
bit difficult to get into the proper mood for a serious occult
discussion. With Kevin, however, it was a completely different
story. I doubt that he even noticed the refreshing breeze, the
multicoloured splendour of the leaves or the lazy white clouds
drifting across a placid blue sky. His mind was completely
preoccupied with the esoteric nature of the puzzle which his dream
had presented to him.

A little nervously and self consciously, he opened his backpack and
extracted a book. There was nothing unusual in that, considering
where we were. Yet, I noticed at once that this was no ordinary
volume he was pulling out. It was large and bound with a heavy black
cover, which bore no title, nor any other markings. He opened it,
but kept it at an angle, so that I couldn't even glimpse a part of
that page.

It was clear that this was his magical journal, the book in which he
recorded anything interesting, in a parapsychological sense, which
he experienced himself, as well as fascinating bits of arcane lore
which he stumbled upon in his reading or conversations. It was a
sign of how close the dream seemed to have brought us that I even
got to see the cover of such a personal book.

"Have you found anything?" I asked.

He closed the book and looked up at me. He shook his head very
slightly, almost imperceptibly. "No," he said, "not exactly. I'm
sure that the ritual I saw in my dream was fairly normal. It was the
thing which apparently responded that is more unusual."

"I'm not so sure," I said. "You're almost forgetting what we
discussed last night about the control you exercised yourself in
lucid dreaming. You could be responsible for the one rather
exceptional item of your dream, which is apparently these sorcerers,
for the first time in their lives, actually succeeded. It so much
fits the stereotype, the archetypical image, for the unconscious
mind in your dream to have presented a demon, rather than say an
angel, as some early Rosicrucians, etc. claim they conjured, that
I'm not at all surprised. The actual nature of the demon, again
possibly because of your success as a lucid dreamer, you'll never
know, as you managed to keep from looking at it."

"Absolutely," he said. "You're right. Still, I feel there's more
than just my individual unconscious mind involved. I have the
strongest feeling that this is just the beginning, a kind of
foreshadowing of something serious. I believe we should be as
prepared for magical action as possible, that we shouldn't treat the
dream only as a dream, but as a precognitive warning."

Very swiftly I weighed all the possible replies I could offer to
reduce his anxiety. He was very possibly completely correct. He was
a Terran of some significant psychic ability, a potentially far
greater adept than he himself realized. Still, I wanted to calm him
down a bit, striking the balance between allowing the thought to
enter his mind that I didn't take him seriously, or worse that I
thought he was not completely sane, and allowing his preoccupation
with this issue to interfere with either his physical health or his
belief in his own ability. When and if he faced a psychic attack, it
would be his will and confidence in himself which likely would
determine the outcome.

"I think there's a good chance that you're right," I said aloud. "I
intend to be on a full state of psychic alert. This means I'll take
it easy when I can, get the rest I may well need before too long. I
also intend to eat at least no worse than usual." He could clearly
see what I was getting at. There was the flicker of a thought that
this was a criticism of his behaviour since his dream. This quickly
faded away, as he realized any serious magical operation, especially
if he was soon going to be under a psychic attack, would require
that he be in top shape. In this matter, a magician is exactly like
an athlete just before a big game or event.

"Very good idea," he said aloud. "Should I search somewhere for an
appropriate defensive ritual, or will it be enough for me to use the
one that comes most easily to mind, depending on the precise
circumstances?" Behind that question was his unspoken inquiry as to
whether I had any spells that could protect him. My answer also
applied to the unspoken question.

"Well, unless you come across something that seems especially apt, I
think it's usually best to go with what you know best."

"What do you think, Green, about the two of us doing something
together?" It was clear he thought that I was a very powerful adept,
or at least that I had some links, for example membership in a
Golden Dawn offshoot, which had a lot of positive resonance. Again,
he was more right than he could imagine. This would only boost his
confidence, if the two of us did work together.

"That may be a very good idea, and it may well happen, especially if
your precognition turns out to mean that this thing is real and
about to enter this time and space." I glanced at the sun. "I think
I better get a bit of reading done before my next class. I'll see
you in the Cicero one." I didn't say so, but I could see that he
caught my unspoken suggestion that it would be a good idea for him
to be there.

He laughed. "Green, I think you can read minds. I was thinking of
skipping it, but I guess you're right. It's a good idea to retain
the routine. There's lots of time, when we're not in class, for
magical research. I guess it's a good idea, too, for us to be in
touch with each other. So, I guess I'll be there, but I don't
promise to have much work done, at least not class work. I've some
things to try to track down in the library that are more important
right now than what the Stoics, Epicureans and Academics thought
about religion. I'm not sure, though, whether I'm going to find
anything worthwhile."

He was thinking that last year he had tried to conduct a fairly
complete search for magical material in the library and that while
it was possible, it was unlikely that he had missed anything bearing
specifically on this case. The first month I'd been on Earth I'd
made an exhaustive search of this library, though I judged I could
not say so. I just smiled and said, "Good luck. Let me know, if you
find anything."

"Will do," he replied, "and, Green, you take care and be on guard."
He didn't have to say more, as his surface thoughts were just
seething with his anticipation of doom.

"I'll stay alert," I promised, "even though I feel that in all
probability we should be safe, certainly until sunset."

"That would make sense. Magic usually works on the principle that
the forces of light keep the powers of darkness at bay while the sun
is in the sky. I hope, though, that this is no exception to that
rule. Thanks for reminding me of it."

"Don't mention it," I replied. "Fare well." I stood up and headed
for the main doors of the library.

It was only now that I finally learned the news.
