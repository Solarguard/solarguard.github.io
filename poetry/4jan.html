Encouraged by prominent ADF bards, here are four more January poems.
Kind words about expanding the forms and doing more to celebrate the
deities helped release the gates of inspiration. May this result be
enjoyable to those who pass this way.

Thanking Brid

Arriving, aspiring, gratitude extending,
Thanksgiving for favours well received,
Appreciating you,
Gratefully,
Brid,
Always there,
Munificent giver,
Constantly pouring out your verses,
Source of inspiration, open-handed word smith,
Mother of poets, rain of bounty,
Inadequate our thanks,
To measure,
Brid,
The extent
Of your boundless treasures.
Admitting our feeble repayment,
Confessing our remoteness, our distance afar
From tribute you deserve,
We try to say, "Thank you
For so much,
Brid."

Druids

There grow the friends of leaf and tree,
Of root and trunk and squirrell.
There druids grow,
Allaying angry tribes,
Harmonizing humanity,
Honouring earth and soul,
At peace inside,
Scholars of ancient lore,
Alive outdoors at Gaea's shrine,
Inhaling fragrant air,
With focused eyes,
Beneath the sun and moon,
Rejoicing, grateful for the light,
Dwelling today at home,
At one with all,
Ambassadors of peace,
Aware of dawn, of coming birth,
Conscious of life today,
Tomorrow's seed,
The past's living harvest,
About to bloom, ready to fly.

Moderation

Upon the road of life we tread,
Avoiding both extremes,
The Middle Path
Ascends the rising slope,
Allows us all to reach the sky.

Present Peril

In a white cloak the modern mage
Releases chained Fenrir,
Mighty Atom
Racing to Ragnarok.
Where is Red Beard with his hammer?
