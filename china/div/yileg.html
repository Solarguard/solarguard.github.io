I CHING, transl. James Legge, Bantam, 1986 (1964, 1882)

This is the richly adorned primary English translation of the
earliest traditional divination text.

The sixty four page introduction (pp. xxvii-xcii) by Ch'u and
Winberg Chai begins with reference to the significance of the
Classic, the traditional attributions of the originators of the
oldest aspects of the system, tortoise shell divination and the Ten
Wings appended to the core text.

Nineteenth Century James Legge's work is outlined, remarks made on
the translation to "divided" and "undivided" lines, the conciseness
and poetic extensiveness of the I CHING and the influence of the
"Doctrine of the Mean" and the Tao Te Ching on the appended Ten
Wings.

Comments are made on concepts: I, tao, yin and yang, hsiang
(symbol), hsing (shapes), tzu (judgement). Three basic ideas are
offerred: ceaseless fluctuation, symbolic origin of human innovation
and arriving situations presaged by transformative symbolic ideas.

There are: the significance of the second and fifth lines, the
importance of understanding existing situations and acting or not
accordingly, the appropriateness of perceiving one's place as
sovereign or subordinate in a divined situation, the united
harmonious whole of all that is, the transitional process of being,
the cyclical pattern of transformations, the returning from one
limit to its opposite, the unceasing, never-ending aspect of the
transformative universe, the attention of the wise person to the
moderate way between extremes, the balanced complementarity of the
social focus of Confucianism and Taoist otherworldliness.

Concluding, the introduction underlines the human centredness of
Confucianism, the wisdom seeking Taoist way and the I CHING
appendices endeavouring to synthecize both.

James Legge's 1882 Translator's Preface (pp. xciii-ci) mentions his
1854-1855 translation of the I CHING, its soaking in Red Sea water
and recovery, Legge's subsequent study of the central text separate
from the appendices, his realization that the Chinese characters are
conveying concepts demanding more than merely verbal literalism in a
translator, enumerates other translations (including into Latin),
specifies the continuance of his rendering Ti and Shang Ti "God" in
English and mentions now his remoteness now from Chinese scholars,
except the previous owner of "The Daily Lectures" who pencilled
remarks into Legge's second hand copy of the book.

The Translator's Introduction (pp. 1-55) begins with Confucius when
aged yearning to devote years of study to the I CHING, the probable
post-Confucian date of the appendices, earliest Chou times for the
core text, describing thusly that text:

   The subject matter of the Text may be briefly represented as
   consisting of sixty-four short essays, enigmatically and
   symbolically expressed, on important themes, mostly of a moral,
   social, and political character, and based on the same number of
   lineal figures, each made up of six lines, some of which are
   whole and the others divided. p. 10

There are the eight trigrams, comprising all the combinations of
three binary (whole or divided) lines and their correspondences, the
forming of each possible pair of trigrams producing the sixty four
hexagrams, the ancient influence of a map of the Yellow River and an
illustrative analysis of the seventh trigram.

There are the ten wings placed by James Legge into seven appendices:

   The first bears in Chinese the name of Thwan Kwan, 'Treatise on
   the Thwan,' thwan being the name given to the paragraphs in which
   Wan expresses his sense of the significance of the hexagrams.
   p. 31

The second, "Treatise on the Symbols":

   treats of the trigrams composing the hexagram, how they go
   together to form the six-lined figure, and how their blended
   meaning appears in the institutions and proceedings of the great
   men and kings of former days, and of the superior men of all
   time. p. 36

The third appendix, "The Great Treatise" describes divination, yin
and yang, anima and animus and much else that Legge feels expressed
similarily to "The Doctrine of the Mean."

The fourth appendix, seventh wing:

   is confined to an exposition of the Text on the first and second
   hexagrams, being an attempt to show that what is there affirmed
   of heaven and earth may also be applied to man, and that there is
   an essential agreement between the qualities ascribed to them,
   and the benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, which
   are the four constituents of his moral and intellectual nature.
   p. 46

This one also Legge feels resonant with "The Doctrine of the Mean."

The fifth appendix contains twenty two "Remarks on the Trigrams,"
allowing Legge to discern God within them and to ridicule the
correspondences to horses they contain.

The eighth appendix, "Treatise on the Sequence of the Hexagrams":

   endeavours to explain the meaning of the name, and also the
   sequence of the figures, or how it is that the idea of the one
   leads on to that of the next. p. 54

The seventh, final and rhymed appendix Legge considers of no serious
value.

The oracular text of the I CHING proper (pp. 57-210) may be read in
Legge's translation of the sixty four hexagrams, one by one. More
resonant to the ordinary Western diviner is such a manual as
Karcher's THE ELEMENTS OF THE I CHING. One basic principle has long
been individual reflection, pondering, meditation, symbol by symbol,
on such a divination system. This solarguard site will, deities
willing, soon contain such a personal statement by Michael McKenny
on each hexagram.

Legge appends pages 213-444 to the text proper and provides a
"Transliteration of Oriental Alphabets" (pp. 445-448)
