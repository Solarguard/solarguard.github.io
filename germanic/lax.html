Laxdaela Saga, transl. Magnus Magnussun and Hermann Palsson, Penguin,
Harmondsworth, 1969

The Introduction (pp. 9-42) notes this is a very romantic saga. A plot
summary is provided and historical background both to the lengthy time
(several generations) covered by the narrative) and to the period in
which the anonymous author composed it. Mentioned is the fact that
while this saga has historical background and characters, it is not
pure history. Bolla Bollason, for example, could not have carried out
his vengeance on his father's murderer, as Bollason would have been an
infant when Helgi died.

The note on the translation (pp. 43-44) names 4 earlier translators.

The story proper (pp. 47-239) begins in Norway. King Harald Fine Hair
asserting central authority causes chief Ketil Flat Nose and his sons
to emigrate. He went to Scotland, his sons to Iceland. Bjorn Ketilsson
settled in Breidafjord. He set his high seat upon the water and where
it washed ashore he raised his residence.

Unn the Deepminded (Ketil's daughter) left Scotland for Iceland. She
married two granddaughters on the way founding prominent lines in the
Orkneys and the Faroes. Unn gave Thorgerd, a third granddaughter,
Laxriverdale as dowry when Thorgerd married Koll, a chief who had come
with them from Norway.

Other granddaughters were married in Iceland. Osk's son Thorstein came
up with the intercalary week. Unn made land grants. Olof Feilan, a
grandson, she named her heir and held a magnificent wedding feast for
him. She died during it and had a ship burial in a mound.

When Koll died Thorgerd went to Norway, married and had a son named
Hrut. His half brother Hoskuld refused to share his legacy. Hoskuld
went to Norway. He bought a slavegirl. For several years she pretended
to be mute. One day Hoskuld overheard her speaking to their son. She
told Hoskuld she was Melkorka, daughter of King Myrkjartan in Ireland.

Thorolf killed unpleasant Hall. Vigdis sheltered him. Hall's brother
Ingjald led a party seeking Thorolf. Thord, Vigdis' husband, agreed to
hand over Thorolf. Vigdis sent him to her kinsman Thorolf Red Nose. He
swam icy water to escape Ingjald.

Vigdis left Thord. Thord agreed to foster Hoskuld's son Olaf and name
him heir. Olaf grew well and gained the nickname Peacock. Hoskuld
removed Hrapp's body which had been haunting people. Thorstein Black
and his party drowned while moving to Hrapp's farmstead.

Hrut came to Iceland to claim his inheritance. Hoskuld refused. Hrut
took some cows and repelled Hoskuld's pursuing servants. Hoskuld's
wife, Jorunn, calmed him and peaceful accomodation was reached.
Melkorka married. Her son Olaf visited King Harald of Norway and King
Myrkjartan in Ireland. The Irish king was delighted with his grandson.

Olaf returned to Iceland. He married Egil's daughter Thorgerd. Olaf
faught Hrapp's ghost and burned it. Olaf travelled to Norway, obtained
timber and built himself the most prominent hall in Iceland. It had
exquisite carvings of the myths. Ulf Uggason composed a poem about
these at the wedding of Olaf's daughter Thurid and Geirmund.

After three years Geirmund left Thurid. He and their daughter drowned
when their ship was lost with all hands. She wed Gudmund Solmundsson.
They had six children.

Gudrun, daughter of Osvif and Thordis, had four dreams. The sage Gest
interpreted them as predicting four husbands for her. She left her
first husband, Thorvald, after two years. Thord, her second husband,
was wounded by his divorced wife and drowned by sorcerers. They caused
more mischief and were eventually killed.

Gudrun was upset when Kyartan decided to sail away for three years and
leave her behind. In Norway Kyartan had a swimming contest with King
Olaf Tryggvason. The king used persuasion, not force, to convert the
Icelanders there to Christianity. Kjartan remained with King Olaf and
Gudrun reluctantly married Bolli Thorleiksson. She and Kjartan were
both displeased with Bolli when Kjartan arrived the next year.

Kjartan married Hrefna, Asgeir's daughter. He gave her a very valuable
headdress. It was stolen. Kjartan blamed Bolli and kept Bolli and his
household inside without access to their privy. Kjartan was ambushed.
He fought off others, but refused to oppose his foster brother. Bolli
killed him.

Olaf Hoskuldsson calmed things down. Hrefna died of a broken heart.
Bolli was killed. His son Bolli was born several months later. He wed
Thordis daughter of Snorri the Priest. Bolli travelled afar and served
in the Varangian Guard. Gudrun married the rich merchant Thorkel
Eyjolfsson. She bore him a son named Gellir.

This book is richly annotated with a number of very interesting things
placed in the notes. For example, it's noted that composing love songs
to a woman is prohibited, as this is seen as against her honour and a
lessening of her marriage prospects. There is the note explaining the
reference in the text to the calendar. Iceland was using a 52 week
calendar and a leap week was added every seven years.

There are also five pages (pp. 242-246) of genealogical charts and 20
(pp. 247-266) of a glossary on the many proper names mentioned in the
text. There are also four pages of maps.
