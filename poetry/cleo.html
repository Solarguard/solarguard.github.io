<H1>Cleopatra Ode </H1>

<FONT SIZE="-2">(I:37), Q. Horatius Flacchus</FONT>
<P>Let's drink! Let's dance. It's time, past time,<BR>
To fit the seats for guests divine,<BR>
Enrich the feast with finest wine,<BR>
To guide the Caecuban, a crime<BR>
Before, beneath its ancient shrine.<BR>

<P>Our crazed collapse a queen aspires <BR>
With men perverted, vile and queer.<BR>
When drunk she dreams success is near.<BR>
One ship alone escapes the fires.<BR>
Now light reveals a clearer fear.<BR>

<P>For Caesar speeds with swiftest oars,<BR>
As hawk against a pigeon slow,<BR>
Or hunter tracking hare in snow.<BR>
So seeks she distant foreign shores<BR>
To flee the yoke, the Roman show.<BR>

<P>She gazes at her humbled hall.<BR>
She bids, resolved, her features calm,<BR>
The snakes to crawl. No woman's qualm<BR>
As vipers strike. A noble's fall<BR>
Disdains the chains and triumph's palm.<BR>
