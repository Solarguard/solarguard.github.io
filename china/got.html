<h2>A God's Own Tale, The Book of the Transformations of Wenchang, the
Divine Lord of Zitong</h2>

transl. Terry F. Kleeman, SUNY, Albany, 1994 (1181 CE)<p>

<p>It is hoped a more complete consideration of this text will be posted to
this site in future.

<p>This divine autobiography was communicated by spirit writing ("fuji" or
"fuluan") in 1181 CE mainly through the medium Liu Ansheng, though he
had assistance from two sons and a cousin.

<p>It records the various transformations of the god in this world and
beyond. This transpires through the centuries and includes some of the
god's impact on historical events. The reader may notice a somewhat
bureaucratic aspect to concepts of the divine. This is not only because
this god eventually becomes responsible for the civil service
examinations and the careers of the scholar officials.

<p>One telling example is the story of the woman informed in a dream that
because she had died in a previous life before a divine decree for her
death by lightning could be carried out, this was about to transpire in
this life. Her noteworthy response was to go and stand under a tall tree
as clouds darkened the sky and thunder rumbled and say:

<p>This bride's death accords with karma and cannot be rejected. I worry
much about the following: First, my husband is poor and my mother-in-law
old. If they lose a wife at this late date who will serve them? Second,
my mother and father taught and instructed me since my youth. If I am
executed by Heaven, it will humiliate them. Third, I am now seven months
pregnant. If by some remote chance I should have a boy, this will
provide a descendant for the Zhi family. Now the first two problems
cannot be avoided. My only worry is that the Zhi family will be left
without descendants. I ask a slight extension of three months, so that I
might die after giving birth. (p. 244)

<p>The local god forwarded this prayer to Wenchang. Wenchang, "Submitted a
memorial on her behalf." (p. 244) She was not executed.

<p>This edition is richly furnished with explanatory material, including an
historical survey of the cult of this significant deity.<p>
