RAINBOW Michael McKenny

Chapter Four Opening

My mouth dropped open. I'm sure my face must have paled visibly.
"You're sure about that name?" I asked.

"Sure. He said it was Zandala's Grimoire he needed."

"By the Light!" I said emphatically. "I did not ask you to repeat
that name. Don't say it a third time. Haven't you heard the
magical rule that the naming of something three times gives it
reality?"

"Calm down. Anyway, I'm sure that's the name of the book he wanted.
He said the name thrice himself and made me look for it in my lists.
What is it anyway? He was pretty mum on that point. I couldn't find
any mention of anything by that title published or even republished
recently or, indeed, since the beginning of the Twentieth Century.
Why are you so interested in it?"

"Did he say anything else?" I asked, ignoring his questions. I was
sorely tempted to simply read his mind. However, I had all the more
reason to respect the wishes of the Wizard of Orange.

"Just asked if I knew where to find it. I told him the truth. I've
been in the business long enough that I should have heard of it, if
it really exists, and that this is a new one on me. Then he muttered
something like, 'It will not be pleased,' and hurried out the door."

I shuddered. "What did he look like?"

For just an instant the bookseller's eyes glazed over. "Uh, I can't
really say. I don't seem to remember very clearly."

"Of course not," I said. "Forget it. It's not important."

"Okay," he said, "I told you what I could. Now you answer me. Who is
this Zandala? I never heard of him, let alone his dark book. You
still haven't answered me that."

"Dark book it is," I said slowly shaking my head. "You'd better pray
that you're right. If that thing's on..." I stopped myself. I had
almost said, "on Earth"... "on any bookshelf, it bodes not well for
the world."

Without giving him the chance to say anything else, I hurried out
the door. Confusion sailed across my mind. How could I believe what
I had just experienced and heard? An extraordinary object just
appears out of thin air and acts as if ordinary humans are beneath
its contempt. Someone comes into a Terran bookstore and asks for the
grimoire of the darkest sorcerer in the known galaxy.

Suddenly, I just didn't want to think about it. I didn't want to
consider all it implied. I glanced apprehensively at the lengthening
shadows as I started to walk the several blocks over to the place
where Orange and Blue were supposed to be waiting for me. A shudder
ran up my spine. It almost seemed that something was lurking behind
those shadows, something dire and menacing. With a toss of my head,
I shook off that sensation and made my way to my destination. Now I
had some forewarning as to just how serious this meeting was going
to be.

I found the building a fairly uninteresting place. It was just
another of the many old houses in Centretown being used as rental
accommodations, largely by students. This one had three floors, one
apartment to each floor. Orange had not told me which apartment, but
when I pushed open the outer door, I saw a plain orange card taped
to the door to the ground floor apartment straight ahead of me.

I brought my hand up to the door, but before I could knock the door
swung inwards. A young man, or rather someone who appeared to be a
young man, wearing ordinary jeans and t-shirt, was standing there.
There was no way I could fail to recognize him, however.

"Greetings," I said, as a feeling of relief swept across me. It felt
good to be with a fellow wizard. It added a sense of security.
However, I couldn't help but notice the momentary look of concern in
his eyes. As he took in the fact that I appeared to be alright, that
vanished, though he retained an aura of attentive alertness and his
many-levelled strength to respond to whatever challenges could 
arise. He seemed in such peak mental and physical condition that he
must recently have used a short energizing meditation.

He nodded, guessing my thoughts, smiled faintly and said, "Glad to
see you could make it, Green."

"Oh, I wouldn't have missed this for anything," I said as we stepped
inside, and followed his outstretched finger into a normal living
room. I looked quickly around, but couldn't see anyone else. Nor,
did I receive the psychic impression that another wizard was here.
"What about Blue," I said putting that thought into words.

"Oh, she'll be along soon enough. She's over at the Public Library."

I raised a quizzical brow.

"She's using one of the public Internet computers there. Just some
information she's trying to track down for her psych course." He had
given that second last word an almost imperceptible stress, so that
I knew he wasn't talking about psychology. Far more significantly,
he had also conveyed that I should behave as if everything I said
was being overheard by someone else.

"I see," I said aloud. I was thinking pretty fast. Yes, it was
possible for an upstairs neighbour to hear what we were saying,
though if we spoke at a normal volume, he'd have to have an ear to
the floor up there. Yes, there were ordinary listening devices, but
I knew that wasn't what Orange was most concerned about. I reviewed
quickly the various supernatural listening spells I was aware of in
Terran occult records. However, what was the point of that anymore.
Orange undoubtedly suspected an offworld origin for our adversary,
or adversaries, and considering what had just happened to me, I
couldn't blame him.

"She left some time ago, so she should be finished pretty soon.
We've been quite busy, since you phoned, Green. I think, though, we
should wait for her, before getting into that."

"Agreed," I said. I moved to take a comfortable chair in the corner
of the room, but he forestalled me and indicated the small table on
the other side of the room. I looked at it more closely and saw the
chess board there all set up.

"So," I said. "You're in the mood to lose a game of chess?"

He smiled. "Rather let's say that I'm in the mood to win one. I
think this may not be such a bad way to while away the time we have
on our hands before Blue arrives."

"You're right," I said. And he was. We were both chess enthusiasts.
It was, we felt, one of the most interesting contributions this
planet had to offer us. As soon as I had communicated the nature and
rules of the game to my fellow wizards back home, they had all
become interested in it. According to Blue's comments, Orange was
perhaps the keenest amongst us. My current situation did not provide
much opportunity for play, though Blue and I had tried a dozen games
during our regular telepathic contact.

Yet, this first game Orange and I began with each other was one
occasion when neither of us could really play the game as we wished.
If our movements really were being scrutinized, either psychically
or by more mundane means, it would not do to have us moving the
pieces at lightning speed in moves that would earn the attention of
grandmasters. So we sat there, as if we were silently concentrating,
as we played a relatively mediocre game, with enough mistakes to
satisfy any unspecified observer, should he have any background in
chess. It was not really very much fun and we were both glad to be
interrupted by Blue opening the door.

We both stood up to greet her. She, too, in her t-shirt, jeans and
jean jacket, looked just like any other student in the city. She had
long raven locks and fair features, though nothing arresting. Her
normally piercing blue eyes had been softened so as not to attract
undue attention. The student's ubiquitous backpack was slung over
her shoulders. She promptly lifted this down as she entered the room
and dropped into a chair.

"Well, I'm glad that's done. I wish I could have found more, but I
guess the prof will just have to be satisfied with the information I
have for this essay. Anyway, enough of that. I'll wait until at
least tomorrow morning before actually starting to write it. Tonight
I just intend to relax. How about some music?"

She looked at me and her eyes conveyed the very enthusiastic welcome
she felt unable to offer more visibly.

My eyes returned the sentiment.

I was surprised to see speakers, which I had not noticed before, and
a CD player. Blue took out a disk and held it up to us. "How about
some of this" she asked.

I shrugged.

Orange said, "Fine by me." Blue put the music on at a volume that
would cover our conversation provided we didn't scream at the top of
our voices. We could filter out the music and concentrate on our
conversation. Orange went over to a hook, reached into his backpack
there and pulled out a book.

"Is that Homer's ODYSSEY?" I asked. It seemed to be an ordinary
paperback book. The title appeared to shift a bit. I had the
impression that it had said something different before, but now in
accordance with my wish it had turned into the book I had mentioned.

"How did you guess?" He asked. He tapped it three times with the
fourth finger of his left hand. This was a special signal we had,
indicating that all was not as it seemed. I looked at that book more
carefully. I managed to restrain myself when I realized what it
really was. This was the Key of Tanarath, an item from our world,
whose guardianship was the responsibility of the Wizard of Orange.

Ages ago, before the Great Peace was established on our world, the
clans of the Western Desert would gather at their most sacred oasis
for special festivals and to talk peace. The chief shaman had a
special block of wood about the size of a man's hand, one of whose
magical properties was that it provided those in the area around it
a complete protection from any unwanted occult influence. This had
helped many an ancient peace conference. It would help us today.

Orange held it up in his right hand and softly pronounced a sentence
in the ancient language of the desert dwellers. Then he passed it to
Blue, who did the same. She next passed it to me and I did likewise.
There. Both the verbal and material aspects of the spell were
performed. We were now assured that no occult influence could reach
into this room.

"I don't know what you two see in chess," said Blue aloud. "It seems
too boring and complicated to me." At the same time, freed finally
by the Key of Tanarath, she sent a telepathic message, "I think it
would be a good idea if we conduct a banal discussion about the
merits of chess or whatever else we want in the local language with
our mouths, while we do the serious stuff like this." In actual fact
so swift is the speed of thought that we could conduct quite a
lengthy meeting, before more than a few exchanges of spoken
conversation were completed.

We agreed, prepared to argue, though not too strenuously about the
great value of the game. Blue was all set to move into an
enthusiastic account of her fun playing Dungeons and Dragons and how
much more creative and imaginative role playing games are,
especially compared to the stark mathematics of chess which is more
fit for a computer than for human beings.

Then we got down to the real business.

"Well," I projected, "we seem to be in the middle of a prickly
patch. Guess what happened to me at the bookstore on the way over."

"First," projected Orange, "let Blue and I fill you in on what's
been going on since we arrived."

I beamed a mental image of me holding out my hands in concession.

"It's a long and complicated story," began Blue. "We are lucky that
we feel safe to think at the speed of thought and are not limited to
the slow plodding pace of spoken language."

"I'm ready," I offered, opening my mind to receive whatever they
cared to send.

However, it seemed that was not to be the way of things. There was
no simple, though relatively lengthy, mental file to transmit, to
use modern computer terminology, as for example, there had been when
I sent Blue the file of Kevin's dream. Also, it was clear that
Orange and Blue wished this to be more a conversation, even though
they had a fair amount of information to share with me.

"First, I'm delighted to be with you," began Blue, "even here under
the circumstances."

"It's always great to be with you," I replied.

"After you contacted me and sent the news about those unnatural
occult murders here, the Council met and sent Orange and me to
support you. We're actually quite concerned. There's no doubt those
murders are more than ordinary Terran lawlessness. The dream record
you transmitted is alarming. Not only is the entity which responded
to the evocation clearly alien, it is very powerful. Frankly, our
analysis is that even two wizards could have trouble with it.

"One reason," projected Orange, "that we are now three."

"That's disturbing," I projected. "By the way, how in the name of
Ay-yar do you come to be in this house? I thought you would appear
in my appartment."

Blue beamed a mental smile at me, one of those she usually reserved
for times we were alone and she had something especially amusing to
convey to me. "The spirit brought us here."

"Spirit?" I asked.

"Spirit, ghost, apparition, disembodied intelligence," she replied.

"You see," explained Orange, "just as you expected, we appeared on
this world in your appartment. It seemed the safest place."

"However," continued Blue, "the moment we showed up there, this
ghost appears, projects an image of a room at us and the request
that we follow him there. He had such a positive aura, almost
golden, that frankly we took him to be one of the hidden masters of
this planet."

"We followed him," projected Orange. "We teleported to the place he
wanted us. It turned out to be this apartment. Then, having brought
us here by scarcely normal means, what do you think the first thing
he does is?"

"Invite you to a game of chess?" I projected.

They both laughed mentally at that reply.

"Actually," projected Blue, "it was to get us to swear not to use
any more psychic energy until we heard him out. We agreed with the
proviso the pledge didn't imperil us."

"I wonder why this house?" I asked. "Was he a former resident of the
place?"

"No," answered Orange, "though he told us there are magicians living
here. They're away for a week's visit in Montreal."

"That's convenient. I just hope the neighbours don't call the police
on us."

"No need to worry," projected Orange. "Apparently these magicians
are always having friends over, so the neighbours don't even have a
clear idea who is living here and who is a guest."

"The next thing the spirit told us," resumed Blue, "imprinting its
thoughts on our minds and reading ours to keep us from breaking its
request that we avoid using psychic power, was that somehow your
place has attracted the attention of some very malevolent entities.
I think they traced you through your friend, Kevin, after he woke up
from his dream. They followed his thoughts during that phone call
and found your place. There's enough of a magic glow there that even
if they didn't overhear you talking on the phone to Kevin, they know
they've located the residence of another Terran adept."

"Only a Terran?" I asked.

"The ghost was convinced of that. They are still unaware that
there's any offworld interest in this planet, beyond their own. He
felt that gives us a significant enough advantage that we should try
very hard to keep them in the dark on that."

"Something else," added Orange. "They're waiting for you to come
home. It seems they plan some kind of ceremony with you as the
ritual sacrifice." I received the visual image of a great shimmering
cage, door open at the door of my apartment, all set to drop down as
soon as I walked in that door.

"Great. just what I need. What am I supposed to do, abandon all my
stuff and move?"

"You're more than welcome here," projected Blue. "However, this is
just getting started. You haven't asked us who this gentleman is."

"The ghost? Do you mean it's somebody I know? Someone from back
home?"

"No, he's Terran," she replied, "and you haven't met him personally.
You have, however, heard of him, because his name has come up in
your reports to the Council."

"Let's see, a deceased Terran of great magical potency and an
adherent of the right hand path. How about Apollonius of Tyana?"

"You and the love of the very old," she projected with a smile.
"Good guess, but he's only old, not ancient."

"A gentleman by the name of John Dee," projected Orange and his
thought conveyed the picture of an intelligent gentleman with a
silvery moustache and beard.

"Really. And what brings the most learned man in Elizabethan
England, the one who had the largest private library in the country,
one of the few humans who came closest to being what we would call a
wizard to Ottawa today to see you?"

"That is a long story," projected Blue. "He started by telling us
that he was back briefly on the material plane through a special
dispensation from a supreme being who probably corresponds to
Ay-yar."

"Yes," I mused. "I might question the actual deific correspondence.
However, I can easily believe some highly evolved entity gave the
spirit of John Dee leave to communicate with us. The question is
what is so important he has to come back to tell us?"

"The reason he was given permission to leave temporarily the levels
of light," explained Blue, "was that while he was alive here he had
a certain secret trust, which he passed on to the British crown. As
I get into details, I'm now arriving at material that will be new to
Orange. Some of this we heard from the spirit of John Dee and some
of it comes from what I was able to get from British magicians over
the Internet."

"I'm listening," projected Orange beaming the hilarious image of a
giant ear to go along with those words. "Green," he added becoming
more serious, "I doubt our transmittal of our encounter with John
Dee's spirit can sufficiently convey the beneficent and positive
glow he radiates. He comes across as a most reliable source. I'm not
too sure," he projected specifically to Blue, "that the modern
British magicians you mentioned are equally as reliable."

"Should have been a giant mouth," I replied. "Anyway you can rest
easy about my feelings towards John Dee. If he was the one really
talking to you, whatever he said has my absolute trust. I'm also
fairly sympathetic towards any magicians who come with his
recommendation."

There came another of Blue's beautiful psychic smiles. "I'm glad,"
she projected, "that you both agree that we can place a lot of
weight on what John Dee has to say. Green, tell me, have you ever
heard of something called the Talisman of Yam Nahar?"
