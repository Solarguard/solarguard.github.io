A Preliminary Personal Enumeration of the Germanic Futhark

Fehu is Cattle. There are many facets of this symbol, especially
when considered in the context of the ancient attitudes to cattle
held by the Indo-Europeans, still visible today in India. The cow is
holy. It not only provides the Northern Europeans and others with
meat, leather and milk, that early and nutritious introduction to
life, it, therefore, was calculated as a basic unit of wealth. The
guarding and the taking of cattle were a primary purpose of the
warrior and gave rise to the perception of a correspondence between
cattle herding, cattle acquiring cultures and the existence of epic
poetry. Surviving traces of the value of cattle remain in the word
pecuniary, coming from the Latin pecus, cattle. So, fehu is wealth,
especially wealth in a moving, fluid, sense. The many concerns of 
money and wealth are involved here, including debts and obligations.
Here can be perceived concepts of responsibility, diligenece, thrift
honesty, competition, investment and generosity. Here also is the
suggestion of the matron, of Frigg, wife of Odin, of good household
management, especially in finances. Indeed, this rune encourages
honourable and reasonable budgeting in every sphere of life.

Uruz is Aurochs. As the cow can be envisioned as symbolizing the
placid routines of the domestic farm, the aurochs arouses a view of
the untamed, tumultuous and thrilling wild. This is the realm of the
hunter, rather than of the farmer. And, there is a plentitude of
corresponding images that can emerge from the primordial hunter and
the ancient forest. Primarily, this can be seen as the game itself,
the vibrant, alert and concealed entity, perhaps eluding the most
determined search, and maybe giving itself to feed the hunter and
his family. One facet of this rune is youthful femininity, as often
the male hunter views the hunted as female. If Fehu is associated
with the matronly wife of the king of the gods, Uruz then is the
young goddess in the full vigour of her youthfulness, her raw,
physical vitality, her unrestrained sexuality. Further, the rune can
symbolize natural vigour in a general sense, and denote the innate
constitution. While it can be applied to either women or men, Uruz
generally suggests the feminine counterpart to succeeding Thurisaz. 

Thurisaz is Giant. In one sense it is the man, larger than life, an
overwhelming male ideal in the aspect of youthfulness and full
vigorous masculinity. It is here Thor, as contrasted to wise old
Odin of the succeeding rune. Complementing Uruz, here is the young
hunter, forceful, energetic, virile, corageous, energized, vital,
boundlessly capable of leaping into contests of strength and racing
in swift and untiring pursuit. The young hunter can be skilled and
he can be clever, but generally what is emphasized in this rune is
more innate and instinctive. Here is the aspect of the brave, the
active, the tireless tracker, trapper, provider of game. Here is man
as warrior, as champion, as lover. Here is the basic physical aspect
of being, one's fundamental constitution. The symbols can be drawn
out and extended to the more normal activities of modern youth, to
the more prevalent arenas of the present, to the vigorous energies
expended in study, work, etc., though the primary image remains
physical. As with Uruz, one facet of the rune could be the swelling
up of the untamed primordial aspect of being, perhaps unexpectedly.

Ansuz is Odin, the father of men and ruler of the gods. This rune
is also male, though here is male in full ideal maturity and wisdom.
Ansuz is the wise old man, the sage and all the elements of his deep
sagacity. If Thurisaz referred to the physical sphere, here is clear
mental perception, impressive insight and keen intelligence. Here is
extensive knowledge, profound understanding and the wisdom of a
thoughtful counsellor. This rune, then, is focusing on careful
analysis of a situation, the opposite of unthinking flinging of
oneself into the pursuit and contest of the hunt or battle. Here,
is advice to look before leaping, to weigh the various options and
choose well. It is not inactivity. It is deliberate activity. It is
also authority and capable leadership. Here is father and husband,
and all the duties and responsibilities of those positions. There
may also be responsibilities outside the family. Whether being in
charge of one's own life, of one's own family, of any area or group
outside the home, what is illumined here is capable leadership,
skillful direction, sagacious guidance. If one is faced with
problems and complexities, let these be managed and resolved in a
well considered and thoughtful manner.

Raido is Journey. One thought arises from the ancient sacred
journey, the divine wagon bearing the image of a deity, in olden
sacred procession. This enhances the normal concept of a trip, or
other movement with sanctity. This rune can also be seen as
corresponding to the journey of life, transmuting mundane thoughts
of passing time into moving along one's spiritual path. Then, the
sacred wagon corresponds to the human body. So, it is treating this
precious physical form, this gift from the gods, with the respect
deserved, taking good care of our health. The primary concepts of
the rune remain those of movement. This can be the movement of a
specific trip, such as visiting someone, going to the cottage or on
a vacation. It can be something more ordinary, such as commuting to
and from school and work. It can also be journey in the sense of
change, such as moving from one job to another, from one residence
to another, from one to another in any aspect of life. One key is to
retain the concept of the divine nature of the movement and to
strive to live accordingly.

Kenaz is Torch. One image illuminating it is that of the torches
accompanying and lighting the way for the divine wagon along its
procession. There are many bright and flickering ramifications of
the torch, and one very basic understanding is the limited and
partial nature of what is revealed, only some brief, however
significant, space near the wayfarer. The torch can suggest the
attitude of the one holding it: looking attentively, observing,
advancing with open eyes, alert to all the opportunities and
challenges along the way. And, it can refer to a specific piece of
the landscape uncovered along the journey: a particular piece to a
puzzle caught in the gleam of Kenaz's light. This can be any
realization, however mundane, though the nature of the symbol often
suggests a glimpse of the unconscious, a psychological, psychic or
spiritual insight. This rune can suggest an opportune arrival of
time to consider, to light the torch and look, as well as remind one
to be aware of the fragmentary nature of what's seen in the light of
the torch.

Gebo is Gift. One image suggesting this rune is the giving and the
reception connected with the ancient divine procession. This can
identify the element of the sacred in connection to gift giving and
to hospitality, one very important facet of giving. Sharing food and
drink, home and warmth, company and security was more serious than
many today consider. Among aspects of giving: the item itself which
can be as insubstantial and significant as a bit of information, the
presence of a friend, sympathy, cheerfulness; the bond connecting
gift, giver and recipient, the sense of duty and obligation that
accompanies the gift; the ancient sacred concept of a gift for a
gift, the exchange of something worthy between the honourable. One
factor in the consideration of this rune is the shape of the rune,
perhaps posing a bit of a challenge for the modern psyche. For the
modern, this shape often indicates prohibition. However, for our
earlier ancestors, it may more easily have called to mind the
crossroads, a place of special sanctity where gifts were offered to
the gods, and even a halt at an abode there where night was passed. 

Wunjo is Joy. This completion of the first of the three aetts (sets
or eights) of runes is a symbol of joy, celebration and success. It
can be seen as the rejoicing accompanying the divine wagon along the
sacred procession in ancient times. This highlights a divine aspect
to our good feelings when things are going well. Wunjo can be seen
as any triumph, ordinary or extraordinary, as any victory, small or
great, as any party, happiness and mirth making, and the cause of
that. It is success. It is achievement, even fame and glory. It can
be passing a year, or graduating, or successful completion of a
project at work. It can be succeeding so spectacularly well as to be
conspicuous and celebrated. If this rune appears in an answering
position to a particular question, then the response is favourable.
There can also be here, within this rune, the caution of being
sensitive to others, of balancing success with appreciation and
gratitude to the gods, of humble awareness of the imperfections of
humanity and of the constant turning of the wheel of fortune.

Hagalaz is Hail. This can be perceived as an indication of some
affliction, destruction and hardship. There can also be the
understanding that it is hail that drives one from complacency
outside into forward movement towards a temporary shelter. There is
the realization that though now such hail is hard and cold, yet it
is really water, a source of life and growth. There is the concept
of the combination of water with seed. In a sense hailstones are
water seeds. This suggests the attitude one may have towards what
seem difficulties, problems and troubles. Rather than being
overwhelmed by such hard, pelting unpleasantness, one realizes that
here, actually, are seeds for further advances along the path of
life, for growing stronger, deeper and more enduring, for moving on
from what the hail may have destroyed, however precious it may have
been, to something new, to the next stage on our journey. Loss calls
forth something to replace it. It is our responsibility to advance
honourably and accept it.

Nauthiz is Need. This can be seen as a consequence, a fulfillment of
the previous rune. Nauthiz underlines the void caused by the
destructive nature of Hagalaz. Nauthiz may initially be perceived
then in that aspect of emptiness, desire and want. This can occur in
any area of life. It can be the most basic needs of food, shelter,
clothing, of money and employment. It can be a more specific lack,
highlighted at this stage of life: physical, romantic, intellectual,
scholarly, religious, spiritual, etc. One balance is the natural
response of what is needed flowing towards the one in need, and the
efforts undertaken honourably by the one in distress to rectify the
situation, the quest to acquire the work, the love, the fellowship,
the information, the virtues and the spirituality required. Another
balancing factor is the sacred duty by the community to ensure that
all the individuals within it are truly thriving, flourishing, doing
well, and, if needed, cared for. It is always good for one living in
this situation of need to seek the awareness of self-worth, of the
value of those caring for us, of practical efforts to achieve.

Isa is Ice. First, this is one of the runes whose shape has some
existing significance for the modern English speaker. It helps to
remember that it did not have this meaning for those who came up
with the runic system. In one sense Isa can be correlated with the
season at the heart of winter, when nature is still and even the
fluidity of water is frozen. This can be seen as stability,
tranquility and quiet, as immobility, as things remaining the same,
as the opposite of change. It generally suggests a negativity, an
inability, as yet, to accomplish desired change. There can be the
element of feeling bound or trapped, firmly held in captivity.
Whatever one's mood, however one may be feeling about one's current
immobility, this can be an occasion for calm reflection on one's
situation. Perhaps one has come out of a storm, or completed a
harvest, and this is the hour or season of rest. Perhaps one
realizes one needs to take measures to break the bonds and move on,
race on down the path of life. In any case, this can be a calm,
relaxing, reflective, determining time preceeding what is to come. 

Jera is Year. This is one of the runes whose shape is reciprocal. It
can be read the same upside down, and it can, for me, signalize the
growth from the bottom left to the upper right, in a sense of now
being a product of the past. This rune is usually taken as year in
the sense of good year, in the sense of a bountiful harvest. It can
also be seen as year in the sense of cycle, of the changing seasons,
and thus it is the ever turning wheel of life and ever changing
cyclical fortune. As Isa is stability, so Jera is movement, change,
and, generally, such change is beneficial, appreciated and welcomed.
It is often the response to the needs of Nauthiz, the harvest
fulfilling so satisfactorily the hunger of the recent past. It is
the landing of that new job, the commencement of that new
relationship, the start of something new, exciting and rewarding. It
can contain other aspects of the concept of change and
transformation, and usually this rune is the enjoyment of something
good, beneficial and desireable within the ever-changing cycle.

Eihwaz is Yew. The yew tree, for various speculated reasons (which
include its red berries, verdant nature in winter and the use of its
wood for bows) has been long perceived as a symbol for death, life
after death and the soul. Eihwaz contains the symbolic significance
of these facets of existence and the corresponding concepts of any
change, especially any significant change. One point to keep in mind
is that Eihwaz is a rune focusing on continuity, even the living on
of the soul after death. So, the possibly great and dramatic change
it foretells, even physical death, but also the termination of any
major stage of existence (possibly a rite of passage) or any very
significant move, can be perceived as arriving and proceeding more
than as loss. This is not Nauthiz and one is not being advised of
any serious want, other than the attitude to accept one's current
situation and dance on along the path of existence. Of course, one
can see this rune specifically as an advice to pay attention to
physical well-being, and it is an indication of change and
continuity within the entire spectrum of being.

Perthro is the Dice Cup. It can, thus, be seen as fate, as the
uncertainties in what is to come, as the gamble of life, as the
changes and chances of mortal existence. One possible thought here
is that it can be mentioning the variety of outcomes possible,
depending on the exertion of effort by the subject of the reading.
This could be a situation and time when things are up in the air,
and whichever direction is taken has a very determining factor.
Another thought that springs from the symbol of the cup is the
suggestion of the joy, happiness, vigour, excitement, pleasure and
companionship that goes along with dicing in the mead hall. There
can be a tremendously thrilling mood accompanying a successful toss
and largely mitigating the disappointment of losing. One aspect
highlighted here is that whatever the outside world may toss at
us, a significant share in the rewards of life is companionship and
the friendships we have, which are to be cherished, appreciated and
well treated. These friendships will be the very pleasant taste
assuaging our bitter losses and celebrating our scintillating
successes, our luck, good and bad.

Algiz is Protection. One image of this rune is of the Guardian, of
Heimdall standing vigilant at the Rainbow Bridge. It may, thus, be
seen as the alert attention of one standing on the bridge between
the conscious and the unconscious, of the careful approach one takes
to psychic and spiritual work. It can be seen as the cautious
advance in any aspect of life, from the care with which one,
especially one involved in the military or related fields, treats
physical security, to the attentive consideration of whatever is of
concern, one's areas of responsibility, one's assignments and work,
one's personal relationships, one's opportunities to spend or to
invest money. As well, this can be a sign to bring to mind, not to
overlook or take for granted, something or someone in one's life not
currently in the forefront of thought. While this rune focuses on
protection, it's not thereby necessarily an urging of inactivity.
Rather it's a sign of cautious and considered advance.

Sowulo is Sun. This can contain the so many beneficial aspects of
that brilliant and dominant orb of our solar system, source of our
light, warmth, and life and consequently associated by many human
cultures with pleasant correspondences. Thus, usually this is a very
beneficial and happy rune, an indication of bright times, of warm
success, of happiness and pleasure. Here is positive energy and many
good achievements facilitated beneath the warm rays of the sun. Here
is victory and triumph, good health and the many positive things
that flow from that. It is the cheerful disposition that can shrug
away any discouragement from others. It is the warmth of friendship.
It is the joy at spiritual growth. It is prosperity, accomplishment
and things going well. It is an opportunity to approach the gods
with something other than requests, an occasion to express gratitude
and to strive to express that in deeds, as well as words, by living
a life worthy of such divine favour and by remembering such times
appreciatively when the changing wheel turns up something different.

Teiwaz is the god Tyr, and as such can connect with concepts of
sacrifice and with physical health. This rune can be perceived as a
representation of the wounded warrior. It can be seen as cautioning
about the possibility of physical injury, and a warning to be
especially careful about one's physical activities and one's health,
whether in the sense of recuperation and healing, or in prevention.
This may well be a time to treat the body well and not to over
extend oneself, not to abuse one's physical well-being. This is also
a rune of sacrifice. This can include physical sacrifice, foregoing
some food and other physical pleasures as a means of physical
discipline to regain, maintain and enhance physical health. It can
well be sacrifice for others, whether the sacrifice of the warrior
defending the community, even at the cost of life itself, or anyone
giving up something on behalf of kin and close ones, or whomever.
Many things can be sacrificed, including, for example, time and an
activity one would very much prefer to do, given up so that one can
help out where needed. As in many things, there are balances to well
consider, though the balances of sacrifice can often be quite hard
to calculate.

Berkano is Birch. It is said the birch tree is the first to present
new leaves in spring. Thus this tree is seen as the symbol of the
freshness of the beginning, the dawn of a new day, the start of
spring. It is birth, or even inception at an earlier stage,
pregnancy. It is the planting of seeds, and, hence, symbolically
that first effort in every aspect of life, the first day of
classes, the start of training, the first date. It is the beginning
of a new project, reign, musical or artistic composition, etc. As
such, one aspect of it is bright potential, the optimistic and
beneficial opportunity for whatever commences to be written, to
be transformed from possibility to actuality, to become reality, to
really be something worthy, wholesome and well. Conscious,
honourable, determined effort from the beginning can combine with
intuitive inspiration and divine assistance to bless those
experiencing the unfolding product, the process of growth,
fulfillment and achievement.

Ehwaz is Horse. One aspect highlighted here is the companionship of
horse and rider. Hence, it is teamwork in many different spheres of
life: partnerships in business, co-operative endeavours in the arts,
sciences and projects at work, relationships, marriage and family.
There is horse in the sense of riding, of transportation and of
communication. So, this rune can suggest messages whether handed to
one personally, or over the telephone, by e-mail or snail mail. It
can even refer to messages communicated from the unconscious in
dreams. Indeed, the horse can suggest moving through, or riding
across, various kinds of terrain, including regions of our mental,
psychological, psychic and spiritual being. This rune can suggest
something in the news, or soon to be, the media, the computer
industry, etc., as well as one's actual horse, or horse substitute
on wheels. It is good to pay attention to where and how one is
riding in all the various spheres and especially to be sensitive to
others in association with the rider.

Mannaz is Man. This rune is human being in all the multitudinous
expression of the term. It is humanity in contrast to the mineral,
vegetable, animal realms. It is human as a strand connected to the
whole web of existence and life upon the planet. It is human in the
sense of us lesser than the gods and goddesses, us frail, imperfect
and mortal beings. It is also us noble, courgaeous, wise and
striving entities persevering in the face of all challenges. It can
denote an attention to the human aspect of a situation, to a specific
individual, including the individual for whom the reading is being
taken, the need to work on improving personal character, to realize
a human flaw and failing and try to do something. It can be pointing
at humanity in the very beneficial connotation of this word with
regard to interpersonal relations, in the sense of being humane, of
respecting the human rights of others, of not barging forward as a
beserker, responding only to ego and want, but of continually being
conscious that we share space with fellow human beings.

Laguz is Water. One aspect of Laguz is that of the depths of the
unconscious, whence emerge many surprising things, including some of
the less pleasant aspects of our personality. Thus, the stormy rage
of anger may suddenly rear its head as a monster from the deeps.
This rune may indicate the fact that we have been burying things
there that may soon erupt in such a manner, if we do not attend to
them. The unconscious can also provide many more beneficial and
elevated characteristics. Even northern seas are not constantly
disturbed and many splendid things can swim in the ocean of the
human unconscious. And, it is adviseable to be attentive in this
element, to sail alert upon this sea, to be less often surprised by
the storms that may spring up and, perhaps, sail more often safely
past the hidden reefs, just below the surface. Other significances
of water: cleansing, purifying, spiritualizing, etc. can also be
suggested by this rune, as well as literal ideas such as swimming
and travelling by sea, though the focus on the unconscious can be
strong.

Inguz is Inguz. This is another name for the god Freyr, the patron
god of the farmer, and by extension of the patient rhythmic labourer
in other fields. One aspect of this rune is the extensive concept of
agriculture, of nature, of the environment. This rune can speak of
gardening as well as farming. It can show concern for weather best
favouring conditions conducive to fertile growth, and by extension
it can refer to the great environmental concerns of the present age.
This rune speaks of plowing and sowing, weeding and tending the
growing crops. It speaks of reaping and storing the harvest. This
can be very literal, and it can be symbolic for any aspect of our
being. Freyr is very intimately connection with the the land and
work upon it. He is also concerned more broadly with performance of
duty and obligation, with our honouring him and all the deities by
our hard work, by our supplicating beneficial conditions for growth,
by our marking the festivals of the agricultural year, by our
sacrifice, by our gratitude and by our respect for life, especially
when taken as nourishment.

Dagaz is Day. The shape of the rune can suggest day in a bilateral
sense, the full period of light and dark, a microcosmic reflection
of the totality of life, triumphal and disappointing, illumined and
the opposite. This reciprocal nature of the shape of the rune, and
the easy cyclical suggestions of this symbol, the correspondences of
continuity that can be attached to it, have led some to place Dagaz
at the end of a listing of the runes, with the impression that the
wheel stands poised to begin another turning. There is also a
natural tendency to visualize this rune in the light, to be aware of
what is when the sun is above the horizon. There are concepts such
as the light of the moon and stars, and even the scientific
definition of darkness as merely an absence of light, rather than
something positive and concrete on its own. Such concepts add
emphasis to what is seen in daylight, to the, by and large,
optimistic, beneficial and happy associations of this rune. So, it
is happiness, satisfaction and fulfillment, creativity, work, energy
and effort successfully undertaken. It is the joy and delight of
daily life going very well indeed.

Othila is Property, immoveable assets, in contrast to the wealth on
the hoof that is the first rune. It is home, homestead, homeland. It
is one's habitation, house and dwelling place. it is also those who
live at home, beginning with the individual self. It is the
physical, mental, psychological and spiritual essence of the person.
It is the companion and family at home. It is the physical home,
community and country, and by extension it is the homeworld of
humanity. At the individual level, Othila is a connection to
parents and ancestors, to genes and genetic characteristics,
opportunities and challenges, including healthwise. It is heritage
and inheritance in the legal sense as well. At the larger level,
this rune connects each of us to all of us and underlines that
common inheritance which is this precious earth upon which we dwell
and which it will be our duty to bequeath to the generations that
are to follow us. So, this rune points to an individual abode, and
the arrangement and stability of that abode and the inhabitants of
that abode, to the immediate family, to the extended family, the
local community, the nation and the world.
