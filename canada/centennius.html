Perhaps a glimmer of Canadian potential still unattained 
can be seen by considering a vision of the country penned 
in 1883. In that year, pseudonymous Ralph Centennius wrote 
"The Dominion in 1983," a portrayal of a Canada that in 
many ways surpasses what we actually have today.

For example, he writes:

"Our population at the last census in 1981, was just over 
93,000,000. A hundred years ago a scant 5,000,000 represented 
the great Canadian nation, which has since so mightily 
increased and proved itself such a beneficent factor in human 
affairs. Seven provinces and some sparsely peopled and only 
partially explored territories formed all that the world then 
knew as Canada. To-day have we not fifteen provinces for the 
most part thickly peopled, and long since fully explored to 
the shores of the Arctic Ocean?"

Ralph Centennius describes great northern cities, such as 
Electropolis on Lake Athabaska with a hundred thousand 
inhabitants and booming Churchill on the coast of Hudson 
Bay with 200,000. More compelling, in contrast to our 
actual 21st Century snowbird spending abroad twice as many 
tourist dollars as visitors spend in Canada, Centennius' 
1983 has Electropolis attracting keenly interested 
scientists and electricians from Europe. And as for 
Churchill:

"Here are the celebrated conservatories which help to make 
the long winter as pleasant to the citizens as summer. These 
famous promenades, or rather parks under cover, have a 
frontage of a mile and a half along the quay, with a depth 
of nearly five hundred feet. They contain two splendid hotels 
and a sanitarium, the latter being surrounded by a grove of 
medicinal and health-giving plants and trees from all parts 
of the globe. A summer temperature is kept up through the 
vast building by utilizing the heat from the depths of the 
earth, and by natural hot springs which flow from deep bores."

More important than details concerning actual hot springs 
at Churchill, Manitoba and the advisability of using 
geothermal heating is the general vision of employing 
advanced technology to render the Canadian North appealing 
to its inhabitants and visitors. In addition to enabling 
Canada to have some width and to avoid the economically 
debilitating outflow of tourist dollars, high tech attractive 
northern cities can also serve as a preliminary step to human 
habitats in space and settlements on other worlds.

And, may I suggest Churchill, Manitoba (population 813 in 
2011) as the site for a more centrally located, futuristic 
Canadian national capital.

Even more compelling, in my view, than Ralph Centennius' 
scientific vision, including his rocket cars reaching speeds 
of 3,600 miles per hour and providing flight from Toronto to 
Victoria in fifty minutes, is his description of government 
finances. Taxation is history. Ordinary expenses are met 
by the interest and dividends on the governments savings 
and investments. The Society of Benefactors addressed the 
plight of the urban poor, including through the provision 
of "respectable dwellings" and inspiration to begin a 
productive life.

Not only are government expenses kept low, including by a 
sense of service which has members working without demanding 
payment, but:

"If any great public works are being carried out, and more 
money is required, the municipalities are appealed to, and 
public meetings are held. All the great cities then vie with 
each other in presenting the Government with large sums. How 
the poor over-burdened tax-payer of 1883 would have rejoiced 
in all this!"

I feel it is a worthy endeavour to transform taxation into 
voluntary contributions funding public service based 
government's responsible budget. A first step, which I 
recommend by word and example, is donating to help pay down 
current government debt.

Ralph Centennius' vision may surpass in many respects our 
actual current state. This provides us with a goal to strive 
towards.
