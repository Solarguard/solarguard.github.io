------------------
Ku-wu-t'u, "...of the royal family of the state of Ch'u..." Received

upon the emperor in his private appartments.

Pan Chieh-yu, "Ban jieyu ca. 48-ca. 6 B.C.E.)" "Favorite Beauty"
"She bore the emperor two sons; both died in infancy." WOMEN WRITERS
OF TRADITIONAL CHINA, ed. Kang-i and Haun Saussy, p. 17
"a well-educated woman who understood the Odes and the admonitory
writings for women". Dubs, v. 2, p. 367 the emperor was pleased with

Pan Yu, a great-uncle of Pan Ku, "Pan Yu had played an active part
in the work of collection and classification of the imperial library
that took place at the end of Former Han."
   Cambridge History of China, v. 1, p. 811

Pan Ssu, "A cousin and fellow scholar of Pan Piao named Pan Ssu had
inherited from his father Pan Yu (d. 2 B.C.) a manuscript of the

together with various other books on philosophy termed "secret"."
  Cambridge History of China, v. 1, p. 811

Pan Po, another great-uncle of Pan Ku, and a scholar.

Pan Chih, Pan Ku's grandfather, was an commandery official under
the Han Emperor P'ing. He retired as he was not keen on Wang Mang.
Dubs v. 2. p. 97


Pan Piao, father of Pan Ku, began the Han Shu (History of the Han,
that is Former or Western Han, Dynasty).

Pan Ch'ao: "In A.D. 97, after reducing the last contumacious prince,
Pan Chao crossed the T'ien Shan mountains, and, with an army of
70,000 men, advanced unopposed to the shores of the Caspian Sea...
The whole stretch of country between the T'ien Shan and the Caspian
submitted to the Chinese without fighting. More than fifty "kings"
acknowledged Chinese overlordship and sent their heirs as hostages
to Lo Yang...Pan Chao despatched his envoy, Kan Ying, to enquire
into the nature and state of the western world...recent studies
based upon the directions given in the Han history have established
that it was not the Persian Gulf, but the Black Sea, that Kan Ying
reached." C.P. Fitzgerald, CHINA, pp. 196-197 The spellings of the
names of brother and sister are not consistent across the different
sources; however, the context makes it clear which is meant. She was
the younger.

Pan Ku is the one generally identified as the author of the Han Shu
although his father and sister also worked on it.

Pan Chao in C.P. Fitzgerald's CHINA (p. 201) is described thusly,
"Usually considered to be the foremost woman scholar in Chinese
history." (see also p. 218) She completed the Han Shu and wrote
poetry and Maxims for women.

Pan Yung, son of Pan Ch'ao, also served in the Western military.  
Appointed commander of the Western Regions in 123 C.E. In 119, he
submitted a memorial outlining frontier history from Wu-ti's reign
(141-87 B.CE>) to 119 C.E. He re-established Han control over vast
territories. CH of Ch. v.1, pp. 415-416, 303
