To Kathleen Wynne, Premier of Ontario
Dated 13 January 2015

Greetings.

Inspired by the Victorian era visionary work "The Dominion in 1983", 
I have contributed to the Ontario Opportunities Fund and encouraged 
others to do so. In 1883, pseudonymous Ralph Centennius underlined a 
number of financial principles that I feel are highly relevant today. 
These include patriotic and philanthropic action. In my opinion, 
patriotic action includes presenting you my assessment of governmental 
fiscal measures fostering economic wellbeing and popular support.

Initially, I'll focus on taxpayer funded boards, etc. I think this 
includes governmental supervision optimizing the number of such boards, 
etc., the number of members on each board and the recompense of those 
serving on such boards. Such supervision needs to preclude members of 
such boards from deciding what to pay themselves, as well as carefully 
controlling how in general they spend taxpayer's money.

A general principle should be that anyone appointed to a board is 
primarily serving the people of the province and not being rewarded for 
anything previously done. It's not an inappropriate time to begin 
changing the channel from a view of assessing worth on the basis of the 
highest number on a recompense's bottom line to how much one can benefit 
the province while stepping lightly on provincial finances.

A Perseus text on business suggests seven or eight members as most 
efficient for corporate boards. How could provincially funded boards 
exceed this number?

I feel that taxpayers will better understand funding such boards, if a 
basic principle is that no member of such a board is paid more than the 
premier of Ontario. Who can expect support for an assertion that their 
lesser duties call for more than those of the person ultimately 
responsible for administering the entire province? This is not an 
argument for drastically raising the premier's recompense, but rather 
for controlling the recompense of those having less responsibility.

Very best wishes is addressing this issue.

May 2015 be an awesome year for you and yours, as well as the entire 
province.

Sincerely,

Michael
