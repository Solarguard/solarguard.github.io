The following synopsis of this enormous novel is mainly intended to
help me keep the general outline in mind; the reader of this summary
is reminded that a menu is no substitute for a meal. Even in this
English translation, the power of this inspired, sensitive and very
thoughtful soul comes through. This book is most highly recommended.

WAR AND PEACE, Leo Tolstoy, transl. Rosemary Edmonds, Penguin, 1969,
(1869).

This vast and awesome novel is preceeded by the translator's five page
introduction, providing a glimpse of the great writer's humanity and
the eternal nature of his characters.

I:1 (pp. 3-124): In July 1805, at Annette Scherer's soiree, Prince
Vasily, first to arrive, chats with her about Napoleon, Vasily's two
sons ("Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole's a fool that
won't keep quiet." p. 7) and Princess Bolkonsky. The cream of St.
Petersburg society arrive, including Princess Bolkonsky and her
husband Andrei. Aging Princess Drubetskoy secures Vasily's word to urge
her son's transfer to the Guards. Hippolyte soothes a pro Napoleon
outburst by telling an amusing Moscow anecdote.

Pro-Napoleonic Pierre follows Prince Bolkonsky and his wife to the
Bolkonskys. The pregnant princess retires early. Pierre dines with
Andrei who laments his matrimonial woes. Pierre promises not to visit
the dissipated Kuragins and heads for home after One. He drifts instead
to Anaotole Kuragin's place. There's dancing with a bear cub. Dolohov
on a high window sill drains a bottle of rum.

Princess Drubetskoy visits her relations, the Rostovs in Moscow. The
Feast Day of mother and daughter Natalia has everyone talking about the
illness of Pierre's rich father and of Pierre's escapades. Thirteen
year old Natasha kisses Boris who promises to marry her in four years.
Older sister Vera has nasty remarks for two young couples. Princess
Drubetskoy mentions her need for five hundred roubles for Boris'
uniform. She goes to Count Bezukov's where Boris speaks to Pierre.
Returning, she receives her roubles from Countess Rostov.

Dinner conversation concerns the Tsar's decree to move troops across
the border ("to establish peace in Europe" p. 71). There is singing and
dancing. As Count Bezuhov lies dying, Prince Vasily and Bezuhov's
oldest niece plot to overturn his will. Princess Drubetskoy escorts
Pierre to his father's deathbed. Drubetskoy prevents the niece from
troubling the dying man about his will.

Prince Nikolai Bolkonsky teaches his daughter Maria mathematics, writes
his memoires and works at carpentry at Bald Hills, his estate. Marie
exchanges letters with Julie Karagin. Andrei arrives with his pregnant
wife. She emotionally greets Maria. Andrei discusses war with his
father. Maria gives Andrei an icon on a necklace to protect him. He
says good-bye to his father.

I:2 (pp. 125-230): In October 1805 a Russian regiment readies itself
first in parade neatness, then in travel worn great coats, for
commander-in-chief Kutuzov's inspection. Kutuzov notices Captain
Timochin, Private Dolohov and the sorry state of the men's boots. Word
comes of Austrian defeat. Rostov is accused of stealing a purse,
confronts the officer who did, and while refusing to apologize word
comes they're going to see action.

The Russian army burns bridges as it withdraws towards Vienna. There's
hurried crossing of the Enns. Napoleons hundred thousand men press the
thirty five thousand Russians. Russians cross the Danube and defeat a
French force. Andrei Bolkonsky bearing the news to the Austrians feels
slighted. The Russian diplomat Bilibin explains that Vienna has fallen
to Napoleon.

Next morning Bolkonsky is received by the Austrian Emperor, answers
simple questions and is surprised that now the Austrians make a big
thing of the Russian victory. Bilibin informs Andrei the French are
advancing on this side of the Danube. Andrei resists Bilibin's urging,
returns and finds great disorder. Russians hastening to meet fresh
troops from Russia, seek to delay the French with a truce. Andrei
surveys advanced Russian dispositions. French attack; Russians fall
back. On the left, Russian cavalry attack. Rostov falls from his horse.
He escapes. Russian sharpshooters fall on the French. Four unprotected
Russian canons cause great damage among the French. Andrei joins in
moving the guns back. Artillerymen help injured Rostov. Andrei speaks
up telling superiors the contribution of the unsupported artillerymen.

I:3 (pp. 231-342): Prince Vasily spontaneously takes the new Count
Bezuhov under his wing, obtains positions for him, encourages Pierre
and Helene (Vasily's daughter) to marry. Vasily and his son Anatole
visit Nikolai Bolkonsky. Maria is flustered, until pausing at an icon.
Anatole, not given to excessive thinking, creates quite an impression
upon three ladies. Maria Bolkonsky sees Anatole embracing her maid and
denies his suit. Nikolai Rostov writes his family. They reply. Nikolai
going to pick up this reply meets Andrei Bolkonsky. Two emperors
inspect their armies. Nikolai and all are stirred by the Tsar. Andrei
responds to Boris Drubetskoy's request and takes him to Prince
Dolgorukoy who shares the anecdote of Napoleon's handkerchief.

The decision is to engage Napoleon. There's a successful skirmish.
Nikolai sees the Tsar again. Rostov, drowsy on night patrol, hears
noise from the French camp. He is sent to investigate, finds French
pickets still in position. Morning sees Russians advance in fog and
Napoleon eyeing the heights they're leaving. The French appear
unexpectedly. Andrei falls rallying Russian troops. Rostov sent as
messenger passes across the famous charge of the Horse Guards, speaks
with wounded Boris Berg and, canonballs whizzing around him, rides over
a field abandoned to the dead and dying. He is too abashed to approach
the Tsar when he sees him in town. Napoleon orders moaning Andrei be
tended. Napoleon's doctor has no hope for Andrei.

II:1 (pp. 345-405): Early in 1806 Nikolai Rostov arrives home with his
friend Denisov. Nikolai addresses Sonya formally, "But their eyes met
and said thou" (p. 352). Three hundred celebrate Bagration's exploits.
Pierre challenges Dolohov to a duel. A novice, Pierre does wound the
experienced Dolohov and escapes unhurt. Pierre separates from his wife 
giving her a large part of his property. News arrives Andrei's probably
dead. He arrives home unexpectedly just as his wife dies delivering his 
son.

Dolohov recovers and begins paying court to Sonya Rostov. She rejects
his suit. Dolohov gets Nikolai to gamble and lose heavily to him. Young
Natasha dances with a very lively Denisov. She turns down his proposal.
Nikolai pays his debt.

II:2 (pp. 406-489): Pierre, stranded at a post station, meets a
freemason. This encounter opens that door and Pierre is initiated at
St. Petersburg. Advised to leave that city, Pierre resists the contrary
urging of Vasily and goes. Anna Pavlovna has a soiree where Boris
Drubetskoy sits besides Helene. The two become close. Andrei tends
little Nikolai as news comes of victory over Napoleon, and Bilibin
writes of the antics of the Russian army. Pierre arrives in Kiev
province where stewards pretend to better serfs' lives.

Pierre visits gloomy Andrei and speaks to him of freemasonry. They meet
pilgrims visiting Maria. Pierre gains the liking of Old Nikolai.
Rostov's regiment has a rough time with little food for man or horse.
Denisov seizes some destined for the infantry, fights at head quarters,
is charged, but slightly wounded on patrol, in hospital avoids
courtmarshal.

Six months later, Rostov visits the hospital, is saddened by its
conditions, speaks with Denisov who hands him a petition to the Tsar.
Rostov takes this to Boris. Rostov is disturbed to find Boris
entertaining French officers now that there is a truce. Boris ponders
prudent means of handling Denisov's petition. Rostov hands it to a
sympathetic general. The Tsar asserts: "I cannot do it, general. I
cannot because the law is mightier than I." (p. 484). Rostov observes
Alexander and Napoleon. He gets drunk and speaks of the grandeur of the
Tsar and the soldier's duty to obey.

II:3 (pp. 490-573): Andrei, gloomy in spring, visits the Rostovs and
notices Natasha. In August he places proposals for military reform
before the Minister of War. Disagreeing with the proposals, the
Minister forwards them to committee, naming Andrei as committee member.
Andrei meets the influential reformer Speransky. Pierre dissatisfied
with freemasonry in St. Petersburg goes abroad. He returns with an
activist message most reject. He goes to Moscow, is fortified by the
original Mason he met, returns to St. Petersburg and accepts back his
estranged wife. She attracts a grand circle to the house.

Pierre becomes annoyed with Boris's friendship to Helene. Vera is
betrothed, though the Rostovs now in St. Petersburg are in financial
difficulty. Boris visits the Rostovs and is captivated by the 16 year
old Natasha. Natasha's mother dissuades him. Natasha is noticed when
the Rostovs attend a grand ball. She dances with Andrei, Boris and
several others. Andrei, dissatisfied with Speransky's circle, calls on
the Rostovs and is stirred by Natasha. He sees her at a soiree and
visits her the next day. He confides of his love to Pierre. Andrei's
father insists the marriage wait a year. Natasha accepts and promises
to wait a year. Andrei goes to Switzerland for his health. His sister
Maria yearns to be a pilgrim.

and scores of horses against an old wolf and her cubs. He meets his
neighbour Ilagin hunting foxes and hares and gets along well with him.
Nikolai and Natasha stop in at "Uncle's" simple place. They enjoy there
delicious food and lively music. Nikolai's mother wants him to marry
Julie Karagin to solve the Rostovs' financial woes. He favours Sonya.
