No. 1 January 9, 2004

The Solar Guard is delighted to launch the Twenty First Century
Federalist Papers.

In the course of time, the precise details of the Constitution of
the United States of Earth will be discussed, debated and decided by
their elected representatives, if not, indeed, by the entire
populace of the planet in binding plebiscite.

The focus at this moment is on replacing the pervading sense of
anxiety, alarm and despair concerning the future of humanity. It is
essential for the awareness of the species to be elevated above the
contending clamours of the present, for the realization to be
attained that far from falling into a permanent period of conflict
and catastrophe, humanity has entered the age of global
independence.

The circumstances, day to day, as the states of the world consider
the articles of the Constitution cannot blind us to the scientific
reality of the harmonious wholeness of the human species. Whether
perceived as the bounteous harvest of evolution, or as the evident
handiwork of a magnificent Creator, there can be no doubt that Earth
is the home of a marvellous diversity of beings. The human spirit
has produced a vast variety of very precious artefacts in many
media, including penetrating thought.

In the course of this age, with the continued growth of global
communications, it is only natural and to be expected that the
various states will become more conscious of the achievements of
their close neighbours sharing the same small planet. The great
novels of China, centuries old, will become familiar and prized
everywhere, as will the fruit of each human culture.

Whether considered as a result of evolution, or of the deliberate
intent of a supreme Fashioner, it must be admitted that the human
being has been capable of very imperfect behaviour, of acting in a
manner not very beneficial. It is vital to underline that the
energizing vigour of being in the age of human independence cannot
cloud us from the very practical considerations such independence
summons.

In general, this is, indeed, an age of demilitarization. A vast
transfer of resources, of human effort and energy can now occur from
destructive pursuits to advancing, enhancing, accelerating human
achievement in constructive, healthy and enduring endeavours. Yet,
this increased ability to invest in health care, in education, in
housing, in social services, in science, technology and the arts
does not eliminate the need for the protection of Earth's citizens
from individuals who would continue forcefully to transgress the
limits of peaceful discourse and civil society.

Nevertheless, while the precise details of the composition of state
and federal police forces can be the subject of wide ranging
consultation, the essential relevant concept is that the
independence of the planet does not require extensive deployment of
heavily armed troops, nor the manufacture and use of expensive
weapons systems.

Any advance in technology, any progress of human achievement, any
new condition in society presents both disruption of the former
pattern and marvellous opportunities. Of course, those heavily
involved in existing military enterprises could feel threatened by
the current situation of global independence. However, any
insightful manager, director, entrepreneur of such enterprises can
calculate the possibilities opened up for investment in many other
economic sectors within the planetary market, not to mention
peaceful human activity beyond the surface of the planet.

This theme and others will be treated more fully in future
installments of these Twenty First Century Federalist Papers.
