<h2>ORIGINS</h2> 

<P><FONT SIZE="-2">This is the first article in the first issue of APAPLEXY,
published at Yule 1984.</FONT>

<P>Our reaction, our enjoyment of stories depends on a variety of factors:
our background, our present physical and mental well-being, the
attunement of our thoughtsounds to the rhythm of the writer's words, the
images and word associations received somewhat differently by each
individual.

<P>I open the pages of one of my several finds in a day of hunting for
second hand books. I am drousy, having hardly slept in the previous 36
hours. There was work, followed by a night long bus ride, the hectic
day, the harsh reality that finds me far from Ottawa. Then as my eyes
move across those lines with evocative and rhythmic prose, a master of
fantasy describes, induces a dreamy drousiness and a hazy transferral of
the hero to another dimension. I doubt if I could have enjoyed the first
chapters of that story more.

<P>Is it only because I've had a night's sleep that the impact of
succeeding chapters is less? What does it matter? There is the wonder of
a new world to view, the action and plot to follow and something else.
Awake, alert I love to see origins, history, associations. So story
aside, how fascinating to encounter here the probable father of all the
towers of Darkover. Here is a psychic circle and how moving to this son
of Celts the identity of an old man. Yet inspite of him, this is a
corrupt and oppressive oligarchy, though its necessary overthrough
foreshadows the more lamentable decline and demise of the more
imaginatively conceived towers of Marion Zimmer Bradley. But there is
more -- more even than the thought the very name Darkover may owe
something to the title of this book.

<P>There is something in that story of another earth, in that other world
that suggests to me an even earlier story. Is this earlier story the
first to describe an alternate world? Certainly the authors seem more
indebted to scientific and philosophical speculation than to any
previous story. Indeed only the sequel published in 1932 suggests the
possibility of not one but several alternate earths. And you know MZB
may just happen to have read that suspense filled original, for would
you believe it, a red headed Celt slips from our world to be mistaken
for a noble. It's the red hair. "Ye see, 'tis th' mark av th' royal Bars
themselves; no ithers have it."

<P>Speaking of red and leaping back to that drousy night in Sudbury, for
even before the morning I had noticed a seed perhaps from which grew a
phrase from Darkover and the title of a book. The seed? A sentence -- a
single sentence about the bloody light of a crimson sun.

<P>For those interested, the books referred to here, if you haven't
recognized them, are: THE BLIND SPOT (1921) by Homer Eon Flint and
Austin Hall, its sequel THE SPOT OF LIFE (1932) by Austin Hall, and THE
DARK WORLD (1946) by Henry Kuttner. An Ace edition of the last,
published twenty years ago, contains a blurb on the front cover claiming
Kuttner's work is ..."The finest science fantasy ever written." The
assessment of Marion Zimmer Bradley, as you may have guessed.

<P>Michael McKenny studies Latin, reads ancient and medieval history,
devours SF and Fantasy (especially that written before he was born),
writes some Fantasy and is an incurable optimist concerning the destiny
of the human race.
