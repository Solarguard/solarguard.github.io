Sirs,

Fifty years ago, introducing THE SCIENCE OF SCIENCE, 
editors Maurice Goldsmith and Alan MacKay wrote: "It 
used to be said that politics was the art of attempting 
only what was possible; now, since almost anything is 
physically possible, politics is increasingly the art 
of finding reasons why it is not done." Goldsmith and 
MacKay 1966 (1964):13

I encourage you to rise above excuses and accomplish 
what is possible. I grew up in a development that I 
heard called the Vets, because it was built for those, 
like my father, who had fought in World War II. Today, 
with many veterans hurting from more recent wars, I 
call on you to provide them with inexpensive housing.

One idea I offer you is that in Ottawa land from the 
Experimental Farm near the Civic Campus of the Ottawa 
Hospital and the Royal Ottawa Hospital be used for this 
purpose, that military personnel build the structures, 
possibly with the patriotic and voluntary collaboration 
of civilian construction workers, and that likewise 
material provided for the project come at reduced or 
no cost because of its altruistic purpose.

If some not directly able to offer labour or material, 
instead wish to help financially, that could influence 
the project's funding. Such precise details matter less 
than the fact that housing veterans is doable; there's 
no need for the excuse that there is no money. In 
general, it is possible to provide on site psychiatric 
services, even futuristic PTSD, limb regeneration, 
etc., research centres at such developments, especially 
at those constructed beyond the proximity of regular 
and mental health hospitals.

Providing inexpensive and/or cost free housing to those 
who served would be following examples from as far back 
as the Romans, including that of the War of 1812 veterans 
settled in Ottawa's vicinity before Ottawa existed. In 
future, veterans' settlements with their research centres, 
and even housing in general for those challenged in 
finding and affording accommodations, could facilitate 
national development, forming a portion of an enhancement 
of Canada's northern sovereignty and technological 
expertise in inhabiting less comfortable zones, even as 
a prelude to human habitation beyond this planet.

Initially, I mention the opportunity, at little or no 
taxpayer expense, to enable veterans in Ottawa to access 
inexpensive housing with available psychiatric support. 
And may each one realize that they all have meaningful 
reasons to live. They all can serve Canada. I look forward 
to you experienced administrators collaborating in the 
implementation of what not only pays back our veterans 
and lets them see they have a future, but also increases 
the well-being and strength of the country.

All the Best,

Michael McKenny, Autumn 2014
