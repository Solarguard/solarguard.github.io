SAN KUO CHIH YEN-I, ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS, Lo Kuan-chung, trans.
C.H. Brewitt-Taylor, Charles E. Tuttle, Tokyo, 1959 (1925).

This popular account of the collapse of the Han Dynasty and the villainous
acts and daring deeds of those tumultuous times was the first great
Chinese novel. Its author is reputed to have been Lo Kuan-chung writing
in the earliest years of the Ming Dynasty. However, he drew on historical
and traditional accounts going back a millennium and more before his day. 

The translator compares this long work (120 chapters) to a Chinese scroll
painting and, indeed, the novel contains a large number of quite
captivating images, including: the black serpent coiling itself on the
throne; the young emperor and his brother being guided by fireflies to a
heap of straw, where a farmer wakes from a dream about two suns at his
place and finds them; the girl Sable Cicada being told that the fate of
the Han Dynasty depends upon her; the valiant warrior Chao Yun holding the
infant heir to the throne to his breast as he fights his way through the
foe to safety, swinging Ts'ao Ts'ao's (the chief villain's) mighty sword,
taken in combat from Ts'ao Ts'ao's sword-bearer; Liu Pei, the great Han
leader, the novel's chief hero, going humbly thrice to ask the great
Taoist sage, the mighty wizard, Chuko Liang, to help him; Chuko Liang at
the great altar performing the ceremony to invoke the unseasonal winds to
permit the attack by fire on Ts'ao Ts'ao's fleet; the statue of the dead 
Chuko Liang putting an enemy force to panicked flight, etc., etc.

This is a vast tapestry, or, indeed, a large scroll painting of many
amazing scenes of baseness and virtue, treason and loyalty, sorrow and
joy. It is an epic in prose, though that prose is adorned and embellished
with numerous poems.

Gods willing, this site will render greater attention to this so worthy
work of literature. One of the goals is to have here an index of the many
characters who walk, stride and ride onto this so entertaining stage.
