A hundred years ago a Westerner interested in mysticism may have been attracted to a certain secret society, open to men and women, and underlining its independence from the Eastern thing,
stressing its aptness for the Western mentality. If one took this path and swore the most binding oaths, then were the keys to the eternal mysteries revealed, beginning with the twenty-two letters 
of the Hebrew alphabet.<p>

Actually, these twenty-two letters may be arranged on the paths connecting the ten spheres of the mystical Qabalah in such a way that after study they may have seemed, indeed, to have been of great esoteric significance, and our Victorian mystic need not have regretted so enthusiastic and lofty a commitment to obtain such apparently mundane information.<p>

What follows, I hope, will prove of more immediate interest than the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, even if, at first glance, it appears to have little mystical relevance.<p>

Our same Western mystic, at the close of the last Century, may have had the opportunity, perhaps, to play a rather unusual game of chess. It was called Rosicrucian chess, and, later, Enochian 
chess. Certainly it was played, though how widely is a matter of speculation. It is recorded that William Butler Yeats, one of the more famous members of this order, played such a game in Paris with the head of the order, the wife of the head of the order and, allegedly, a spirit. While all the rules of the game seem not to have been recorded, it may be deduced from the above anecdote that it was a four handed variant.<p>

References to this game were intriguing enough that it exerted an influence on the imagination of many encountering reference to it throughout the Twentieth Century. In the last two decades mystics and chess enthusiasts in New Zealand researched available documents, and after considerable consultation and practical work, came up with a playable game.<p>

Much of the rest of this paper will consist of the basic rules they developed. There are additional rules for an advanced version of the game. However, for now I think it will be sufficient to mention what follows.<p>

A. The game may be played on a regular chess board with regular pieces, two extra Kings and Queens being required. The theory is that players select one of four boards representing one of the four elements: air, water, fire and earth. A regular chess board may be considered to correspond to any of these four elemental boards. The board is further seen as divided into four parts, corresponding to the four elements: air, water, fire and earth. Two pairs of players play. Air and Fire are always allies. Water and Earth are always allies. The player playing on the dominant angle of the board, that corresponding to the element of the board itself, goes first. If agreement is not possible on who gets to play this and other angles, players may flip coins, toss 
dice etc to resolve the issue.<p>

B. The position of the pieces at startup looks like this:<p>

<pre>
       Air       x,x x x x o o x x,x       Water
                   x x x x o o x x
                   o o o o o o x x
                   o o o o o o x x
                   x x o o o o o o
                   x x o o o o o o
                   x x o o x x x x
       Earth     x,x x o o x x x x,x       Fire

</pre><p>

The King is placed on the corner square, called the throne square, and shares that square with one other piece. Only one of them may move off of it at one time, and once they seperate they may not come together again. Before they seperate, they may be checked and captured together. This description does not prevent the King from moving out of check, if he can. The second row is occupied by pawns, as in normal chess. The first row is where the major pieces are arranged. Note that all four sides are set up identically. Note also that while there is setup variation, according to elemental focus, all setup variations include the location of the Rook two spaces from the Queen.<p>

<pre>
     Earth of Earth and Earth of Fire Setup Positions:
          King and Rook, Bishop, Queen, Knight.

I repeat that all four sides set up identically.<p>

C. The movement of the pieces is generally the same as in regular chess. However, note that the Queen is only moved two squares in any direction, and lands and captures only on the second square. As a Knight, the Queen may leap over a piece between her and her destination. <p>

The pawn must always move one space forward, unless capturing which it does diagonally, as in normal chess. It may not begin with the two space move of ordinary chess.<p>

There is no en passant.<p>

There is no castling.<p>

D. Players agree beforehand, by dice etc, if necessary, as to the direction of play, either deasil or widdershins (clockwise or counter-clockwise). The traditional way was deasil (clockwise). The direction of play may not be altered once the game is under way.<p>

E. The first King is captured. One still says, "check". A player must attempt the normal response to being checked, to move out of check, to capture the checking piece or to interpose another piece between the checking piece and the King. However, while a King may not gratuitously place itself in check, if it is already in check, it may move into check. It may be possible for the 
checked King's ally to delay the capture long enough, for this to result in the King's escape. <p>

Once a King is captured, it is removed from the board and the surviving pieces of that angle (pawns plus major pieces) are frozen. No other piece may move onto the squares occupied by these 
frozen pieces. <p>

Should a player capture a King, and then lose his own King to the ally of his frozen opponent, this ally may then offer that player's ally the opportunity for an exchange of Kings. Players 
whose Kings have been captured may not themselves discuss an exchange of Kings. An offer of an exchange of Kings may be made at once on the capture of the second King, by the one who captured 
it, or by him on any of his subsequent moves. If declined, it may be repeated during any of his subsequent moves. It may only be made if the second King captured was that of the opposing player 
who captured the first King. If accepted each rescued King is placed on his throne square, or as close to it as possible, should the throne square be occupied or under threat. The frozen 
pieces at once become unfrozen.<p>

F. Pawns advancing to the other side of the board usually are not promoted according to the wish of the player moving them. See last paragraph of this section for exception. Such a pawn will 
become that major piece corresponding to the one in front of which it stood at the start of the game. The pawn standing in front of the throne square at the beginning of the game will not become 
another King, but a piece corresponding to that which shared the throne square with the King. If it was an Air of Air setup, a Bishop, if Fire of Earth, a Knight etc.<p>

Promotion of a pawn may only occur after a player has already lost one or more pawns. Any pawns reaching the opposite side of the board before this will await the loss of a pawn before being promoted.<p>

If a player has only a King, Bishop or Queen and one pawn, that pawn on arriving at the other side of the board may be promoted according to the wish of the player.<p>

G. Should three Bishops be occupying three squares forming three-fourths of a larger square and the fourth Bishop move to complete that larger square, this is called a concourse of Bishops, and the player completing the concourse, as per the diagram below, captures both enemy Bishops, and assumes command of his ally's Bishop. This rule also operates for Queens. The required pattern 
is as follows for only the five positions indicated below:<p>

<pre>
       Player 4    o o o o o o o o     Player 3
                   o 2 1 o o 2 1 o
                   o 3 4 o o 3 4 o
                   o o o 2 1 o o o
                   o o o 3 4 o o o 
                   o 2 1 o o 2 1 o
                   o 3 4 o o 3 4 o
       Player 1    o o o o o o o o     Player 2

</pre>

H. Notation of spaces on the board is as follows:<p>

<pre>
        Air       1a 2a 3a 4a 1d 1c 1b 1a    Water
                  1b 2b 3b 4b 2d 2c 2b 2a
                  1c 2c 3c 4c 3d 3c 3b 3a
                  1d 2d 3d 4d 4d 4c 4b 4a
                  4a 4b 4c 4d 4d 3d 2d 1d
                  3a 3b 3c 3d 4c 3c 2c 1c
                  2a 2b 2c 2d 4b 3b 2b 1b
       Earth      1a 1b 1c 1d 4a 3a 2a 1a    Fire

</pre>

Game play may be recorded under 4 columns, one for each angle of play. Thus, it's only necessary to record an element if a player moves a piece onto the element of another player.  Thus, for a widdershins (counter-clockwise) game on the Air board, recording could begin:<p>

<pre>
       Air      Earth       Fire      Water
       p3c      NA3d...
</pre>

Here are the standard notations for pieces etc:<p>

<pre>
       p pawn              A Air       x captured piece
       Q Queen             E Earth     + check
       N Knight            W Water     ++ captured king
       B Bishop            F Fire      # promoted pawn
       R Rook                          ? Questionable move
       K King                          * Bad move
</pre>

A few points concerning the play of the game and the value of the pieces may be of interest. The various setup positions contribute some variation in game strategy and the weight one may assign to pieces. One thing to be alert for are damaging early moves, such as pawn to 3c in the Water of Air or Water of Water setup, if played widdershins (anti-clockwise). This leads to a fool's mate. If played deasil (clockwise) one's ally will have an opportunity to cover square 2c. <p>

The diagram belows illustrate Air playing the pawn to 3c and Earth's Knight advancing to 2c. Of course, the pawn at 1c is pinned by the rook at Earth 3a.<p>

<pre>
      Air        K,Q B R N o o p Q,K       Water
                   p p o p o o p B
                   o N p o o o p R
                   o o o o o o p N
                   o p o o o o o o
                   R p o o o o o o
                   B p o o p p p p
     Earth       K,Q p o o N R B Q,K         Fire
</pre>

The next diagram illustrates deasil (clockwise) play for that first move with each of the four players playing p3c, thus permitting each ally's Bishop to control 2c before the opposing Knight can make the damaging move to that square.<p>

<pre>
     Air         K,Q B R N o o p Q,K        Water
                   p p o p o o p B
                   o o p o o p o R
                   o o o o o o p N
                   N p o o o o o o
                   R o p o o p o o
                   B p o o p o p p
     Earth       K,Q p o o N R B Q,K         Fire
</pre>

In general, it would appear that bringing out major pieces right at the start of the game tends to be less beneficial than appropriate pawnal development. It is often a good idea to watch the pawn at 2b. This is protecting the throne square. It is theoretically possible for one Bishop to check both throne squares at the same time, though since the first King must be captured, even were such a double check to occur, the second King may escape. Still, it's not a bad idea to be alert to such very basic things.<p>

The move of the Queen seems to provide difficulty for some players. Be especially attentive to two Queens operating together. Here, for example is an illustration of a Knight being forked by Queens. If the leftmost column is taken as the boundary of the board, it will be seen that each of the 6 options available to the Knight, indicated by x, could result in one of the Queens capturing the Knight.<p>

<pre>
                               x o x o
                               o Q o x
                               o N Q o
                               o o o x
                               x o x o
</pre>

Here's the start of a game (Earth of Air setup, deasil direction) in which Water is initially confused as to the moves of Queens:<p>

<pre>
         A          W          F          E

     1. p3c       p3c        p3c         p3c
     2. p4c       B3b        p4c         B3b
     3  B3b       N1c        Q1c         p4c
     4  N1c       NA4b       B3b         p3d?
     5  QW3d      B2c?       QW4c        N3c
     6  QF2d      B3d?       QA4bxN      p4d
     7  QxB       p1c        pE4dxp      BW3dxQ...
</pre>

The diagram below indicates the first questionable move, showing the board as it was at Water's fifth move. The V shows where Water's Bishop moves. The O shows the response by Fire's Queen. The Z shows the move by Air's Queen. A better Water move may have been p1c.<p>

<pre>
        Air      K,R o o o o o p R,K      Water
                   p p B N o V p o
                   N o p p Q p B Q
                   o o o o o O p o
                   o o p o o o Z o
                   Q B o p p p o Q
                   N p o o o B p p
       Earth     K,R p o o o o N R,K      Fire
</pre>

The diagram below shows the board as it was at Water's sixth move, indicating the second questionable one in a row that player made. The V shows Water's move. This is followed by the loss of both Bishop and Knight. N1c would likely have been much better.<p>

<pre>
       Air       K,R o o o o o p R,K  
                   p p B N o B p o
                   N o p p V p o Q
                   o o o o o Q p o
                   o o p o o o Q o
                   Q B N p p p o o
                   o p o o o B p p
                 K,R p o o o o N R,K
</pre>

Also, it seems sometimes difficult to keep attention on both adversaries at the same time.  

Normally, the Rook should be considered the most valuable piece.

Note that Queens and Bishops only control half the squares on the board, while the Knights can contol each square on the board. While there are some setups where Queens may be quite effective, especially defensively, in general they may be considered to be worth something less than Knights and Bishops. While one infused with the spirit of regular chess may find exchanges of Bishops or Knights for Queens quite tempting, this generally is a temptation worth avoiding, if possible. <p>

In general one is well advised to ponder the board closely before moving, to hesitate about exchanges, especially those involving two pieces (includes pawns) for one opposing piece, and to be attentive to one's ally's situation. Also, one is usually well advised to consider opportunities for double pawns etc., as the advance and promotion of pawns may be fairly 
significant in this game.<p>

Anyway, there is enormous variety possible taking into account the different startup positions etc. I think I've gone on at great enough length, and, if anyone has actually followed this to the end and found it perhaps a bit more interesting than the exoteric description of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, then I'm delighted. If there are any questions, I'll at least try to answer them.<p>
