RECALL THEM ALL

A single sun, the source of light and life.
The way to hope, the road to rise from strife.
A single One above the human mind
To shine in peace, to leave the wars behind.

A fire to blaze in warmth beyond the night,
A glow to bask the wounds of might is right,
To know, to feel a paradise divine,
A nova bright uniting all as Thine.

The force of One, a harmony denied,
A solid block of stone, a life that died.
Witch-finders and Crusaders loving lies,
To Hell with those your certainty denies.

Who died for thoughts of gods when life was wild?
Who burned before there was a selfish Child?
Let go the One too high, a leaf to fall.
Cycle around again. Recall them all.

Michael McKenny Samhain 1997 CE
