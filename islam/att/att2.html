At Tabari (THE HISTORY OF AL TABARI), vol. 6 "Muhammad at Mecca"
transl. W. Montgomery Watt and M.V. McDonald, SUNY, Albany, 1988

Here is a brief summary of the life of Muhammad and the consolidation of
Islam in Arabia as recorded in volumes six to ten of this English
edition.

Muhammad's father died before Muhammad's birth. When the child was
around eight, a monk recognized the sign of his future. Muhammad grown
married Khadija who bore him seven children. When he was thirty five,
the kaaba was rebuilt. Earlier Abraham and Ishmael had tended it.

Muhammad felt his approaching revelation. There were expectations a
prophet would emerge. The forcefulness of the revelation caused Muhammad
to doubt his sanity. He was reassured. Khadija was the first believer.
Some say the first male believer was Ali, others Abu Bakr or Zayd ibn
Harithah. Muhammad had a vision of the ascending levels of heaven. He
was taught ablutions and prayer in revelation.

After three years Muhammad spoke in public. He was not opposed until he
spoke against the gods of his people. The pressure was so severe that he
advised most of his followers to move to Ethiopia. He stayed. Hamzah, a
strong hunter, responded to the ongoing persecution by announcing his
belief. Abdallah ibn Marud, recited the Koran in public and was beaten.

The Ethiopian leader refused to send the Muslim refugees back. An
attempt was made to mollify Muhammad. He spoke well of the gods, gaining
the good will of the polytheists. Reports of this led the refugees to
return from Ethiopia. Then Muhammad said Satan has always interpolated
his words into revelation. This angered the pagans who renewed their
oppression. Khadija died as did powerful Abu Talib who had been
protecting Muhammad. The prophet sought help at al Ta'if. It was
refused.

Muhammad spoke to the pilgrims coming from across Arabia. He impressed
some from Medina who swore allegiance to him. Soon afterwards many in
Medina embraced Islam, came to Mecca and pledged allegiance to him. This
external support only increased opposition from Meccan unbelievers.

Muhammad advised believers to migrate to Medina. Ali and Abu Bakr
remained with Muhammad in Mecca. Muhammad escaped assassination and
moved to Medina.

vol. 7 "The Foundation of the Community" transl. and by W. Montgomery
Watt and M.V. McDonald, SUNY, Albany, 1987

The translator's forward (pp. xv-xxxviii) notes that this volume treats
the first four years of residence in Medina, the foundation of religion
and community, the beginning of Muslim violence, the assertion of
Islam's distinctiveness from Judaism and raises issues of sources and
chronology.

Muhammad first attended Friday prayer in Medina, delivered its first
sermon urging remembrance of God, and, loosing the reins of his camel,
let it select the site of the mosque. At first, peaceful expeditions
were sent forth. Ali married Fatimah at the end of August 622.

There was fighting during a traditionally sacred month. In early 624,
the direction of prayer changed from Jerusalem to Mecca. Fasting was
prescribed. Muhammad led a force to intercept the Mecca bound caravan
from Syria. Muhammad camped at a well near Badr and filled in the other
wells there. He let those Quraysh who asked drink. The battle was a
Muslim victory.

Umar ibn Wahb went to assassinate Muhammad, instead embraced Islam
returned to Mecca and led many to the Faith. Muhammad expelled the
Jewish clan Banu Qaynuqa from Medina. Abu Sufyan raided Medina. A poet
wrote a love poem concerning a married woman and was assassinated. A
supporter of the poet was also assassinated.

The Muslims suffered losses and Muhammad was wounded at Uhud in March
625. A ruffian sent to assassinate a prominent Meccan had misadventures
and returned to Medina. Some Muslim envoys were killed without warning.
When Muhammad asked a Jewish clan for blood payment, they plotted his
death. He had them expelled.

vol 8, The Victory of Islam, transl. Mishael Fishbein, SUNY, Albany,
1997.

The Translator's Foreward (pp. xi-xxiii) notes this volume covers the
period (mid 626 to the beginning of 630) of the transformation to
Islamic dominance of Arabia, though doctrinal development is not so
clearly recorded. Mecca resisted the seige in part due to Salman the
Persian's trench. There is also here the vindication of A'isha's honour,
Muhammad's letters to the rulers and the battle at Mutah against the
Byzantines.

Muhammad married attractive Zaynab. Jews stirred up a Meccan strike
against Medina. The Persian Salman advised building a defensive trench.
Muhammad with flashing lightning thrice blasted an obstacle to the
digging and predicted victory over Persia, Byzantium and Yemen. Ali
fought well. Nu'aym, a secret Muslim, sowed seeds of discord amongst
the allied beseigers. Disunited and beset by a fierce storm, they
withdrew.

The local Quraysh surrendered and were executed. Muhammad's camels were
raided. Salamah ibn al Akwa pursued and retrieved them. Muhammad
defeated the Mustaliq, married Juwayriyah and freed on her account a
hundred families. Muhammad's wife A'isha became a victim of runours; her
innocence was established in a revealed verse.

Muhammad led his people on pilgrimage to Mecca. There was tension and
the signing of a truce:

   In his account, Ibn Humayd (on the authority of Salamah - Ibn Ishaq -
   al-Zuhri) adds that al-Zuhri used to say: No victory greater than
   this one had been won previously in Islam. There had been only
   fighting when the people met together; however, when the truce took
   place, and war laid down its burdens, and all the people felt safe
   with each other, they met with each other in conversation and debate,
   and no one possessing understanding was told about Islam but embraced
   it. Thus, in those two years as many or more entered Islam as had
   been in it before. p. 90

Raiding elsewhere continued. Muhammad sent envoys to world leaders,
including to Persia, Byzantium and Ethiopia. Heraclius recognized
Muhammad's truth, but the Romans opposed. The Ethiopian ruler al Asham
accepted and sent his son leading a party to Arabia; their ship sank.
Persia's Kisra tore Muhammad's message. The Prophet said his kingdom
would be torn. Kisra's prompt overthrow impressed Muslims.

Muhammad moved against Khaybar. An attempt to poison him failed. He
went to Mecca on pilgrimage. Amr ibn al As, an Arab resident in
Ethiopia, on seeing al Asham's respect for Muhammad, went to the Prophet
and declared his belief. Further Islamic raids took place. An expedition
north encountered a large Byzantine army. There was a clash and both
sides withdrew.

Muhammad led a large party to Mecca. The prominent Meccan Abu Sufyan
converted. There was a little fighting. Many in Mecca swore allegiance
to Muhammad. Idols were destroyed.

vol. 9, The Last Years of the Prophet, transl. Ismail K. Poonawala,
SUNY, Albany, 1990.

Attackers were defeated at Hunayn. Muhammad beseiged at Ta'if. It held.
delegations came to Muhammad from various tribes to announce they
embraced Islam. At Ta'if sent a delegation to Muhammad, accepted Islam
and witnessed the demolishing of its idol.

Muhammad led an expedition into Byzantine territory and returned to
Medina. there was a poetic exchange. More envoys arrived, more
acceptances of Islam. Muhammad explained some details concerning
pilgrimage, etc. He sent Ali, at the head of an army, to Yemen. More
conversions occurred.

Muhammad spoke of treating wives kindly, of avoiding theft. Additional
expeditions were dispatched.

Itemized and considered are Muhammad's pilrimages, wives, freedmen,
scribes, horses, mules, camels, sheep, swords, other weapons and
armaments, names and chacteristics.

In 632 as he fell ill, he ordered an expedition north. He spoke
considerately to his companions, to the dead, to his wives. He indicated
special pleasure in Abu Bakr, asking that only Abu Bakr's entrance to
the mosque remain open. He urged moderate mourning and called for pen
and paper. This request produced wrangling and was not granted. He had
Abu Bakr lead the prayers. He died in the presence of A'isha.

Abu Bakr informed the people and said that Muhammad had died and God is
immortal. There was some hesitation (especially from Ali's adherents) to
acknowledge Abu Bakr's succession. Several months later, following the
death of Fatimah, Ali gave allegiance to Abu Bakr.

vol. 10, the Conquest of Arabia, transl. Fred M. Donner, SUNY, Albany,
1993.

The translator's foreward (pp. xi-xxiii) notes the two broad themes of
the volume, succession to Muhammad and suppression of the Apostacy, a
misleading term in those cases where not Islam but the tax to Abu Bakr
was denied. At Tabari's main source here is Sayf ibn Umar, much
criticized for unhistorical manner, tribal chauvinism and linguistic
difficulties, likely reflecting Sayf's collation of diverse accounts in
a vaiety of dialects. This situation renders this English translation
provisional.

Considerations occurred as to the successor to Muhammad, while Ali was
busy preparing the body. Despite contention, most in Medina swore
allegiance to Abu Bakr. He refused to alter Muhammad's direction that
Usamah ibn Zayd lead an expedition. Addressing the departing warriors,
Abu Bakr urged them to refrain from deception, the killing of children,
women and old men, the needless killing of animals and the destruction
of trees.

When Badham of Yemen had passed, the Prophet had appointed those
responsible for territories in Yemen and Hadramawt. Ali Aswad vigorously
opposed. He was assassinated.

Fatimah died three months after Muhammad.

Seeing Abu Bakr's position weakened by the dispatch of the expedition,
some moved against him. He prevailed. Usumah returned and Abu Bakr led
his forces to victory at al Abraq. He wrote a letter calling apostates
to return to the faith. He prepared a treaty for those who did.

Tulaybah, a leading opponent, was defeated and fled to Syria. Later he
embraced Islam and swore allegiance to Umar. Those consolidated included
the Tamim. Sajah, a prophetess, married the prophet Musaylimah, who is
contrasted in his ineffectiveness to the beneficial Muhammad. Attacking
Muslims killed Musaylimah in a very fierce battle. His tribe's survivors
largely embraced Islam.

The apostates of al Bahrayn were overcome and returned to Islam. Even a
Christian monk, impressed by what he had seen, converted. At Daba a
Muslim victory brought Uman under control. In Yemen al Aswad's partisans
rebelled. Fayruz hard pressed was reinforced and prevailed. Hadramawt,
restless over taxation, was quelled. Abu Bakr accepted the repentence of
al Ashaf, though his name wasn't in the treaty.
