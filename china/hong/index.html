<h2>HONG LOU MENG</h2>

<p>Hong Lou Meng, a work translated as A Dream of Red Mansions and as The Story of the Stone, is considered by many to be the culmination of Chinese Classical fiction. It may well be the highest attainment in human literary endeavour. This web page initially offers a plot synopsis, an initial Jia family tree chart and an introductory presentation of the awesomely impressive nature of the work. It is hoped in time to add a fuller genealogical chart, comprehensive character list and attempts (however incomplete) at indicating some of the cultural treasury forming the world on which these characters live. This page was created on December 22, 2004 C.E. and last updated on September 25, 2006 C.E.<p>
