<center>ORIENTAL RELIGIONS IN ROMAN PAGANISM</center><p>

Franz Cumont, Dover, New York, 1956 (1906)<p>

This is an examination of the influence of the religions of Syria, Asia
Minor, Egypt and Persia on Roman paganism from the time of the
introduction of the Great Mother in 204 BC (Nones of April to be
precise) to the end of antiquity. The author examines how the religions
spread, and most important why. This leads him to offer us the
understanding that there was ethical and moral depth to these beliefs
and most especially to that of Sol Invictus (which title was applied to
Mithras p. 146) The pages on astrology make interesting reading. The
point driven home in this book is that there was a transformation in all
of these faiths as time passed, so that to criticize them by reference
to their origins was to demonstrate unawareness of present (e.g. 3rd C
AD) reality. Even more were they distant from traditional Roman
paganism. Indeed, in his preface to the first edition, M. Cumont has the
following delightful sentence,<p>

<blockquote>The faith of the friends of Symmachus
was much further removed from the religious ideal of Augustus, although
they would never have admitted it, than that of their opponents in the
senate.</blockquote>

<p>Quintus Aurelius Symmachus is seen as the leading pagan
aristocrat in the late 4th Century and the "opponents" were, of course,
the Christians.

<p>This review first appeared in the 51st edition of APAPLEXY, published on
January 20, 1990.<p>
