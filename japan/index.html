<H1>Japan</H1>

Japan, a fascinating blend of civilizations from south, east and west, offers humanity elevated examples of human character, highly refined craftsmanship in a wide variety of fields, profound philosophic and spiritual awareness. At present, this site offers Michael McKenny's look at two of Lacfadio Hearn's works on traditional Japan and of Carmen Blacker's THE CATALPA BOW, subtitled "A Study of Shamanistic Practises in Japan." It also provides a link to the University of Hawaii's Center for Japanese Studies page. Sometime in the future hopefully the Solarguard Japan section will include summaries of such works as the Nihongi. This was last updated on August 5, 2006.<p>
