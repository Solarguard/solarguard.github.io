<h1>Science-Fiction</h1>

<p><hr><p>

Science Fiction is a vast expression of human vision, optimistic and creative as well as pessimistic and destructive. An enormous amount has been written and other media (radio, TV, movies, computer games, role playing games around the table as well as with other players on-line) have been and are being utilised in this awesome genre. Much of this activity can be described as entertainment, even escapism, and this field has permitted some of the keenest speculation, insight and brain storming about humanity's problems and opportunities.<p>

At present, this site offers Michael McKenny's review of H.G. Wells's awesome novel, THE WORLD SET FREE, his satire of Marion Zimmer Bradley's ENDLESS UNIVERSE and his look at both the origins of her Darkover and at the concept of alternate worlds, as well as a link to an extensive BABYLON FIVE page. A Separate section exist for the works of Andre Norton and under Russia will be found consideration of some Russian language SF.
