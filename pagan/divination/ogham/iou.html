<P>Date: 17 Apr 2001

<P>Here is my initial consideration of the divinatory significance of the twenty ogham letters. As in all divination, this is a guide and at the moment of seeking fuller knowledge, the diviner is influenced intuitively and by the specific circumstances in which the reading occurs. I have  assigned designations to the letters according to my perception of them, and these titles may vary from those selected by others writing on this theme.  

<P>Beithe Birth

<P>Beithe is birch, is the start, the beginning, the birth, the dawning of a new day. It is the vast potential that reaches forward. It is the spring with all the work that must be done to plant the seeds that will grow through the summer and grant the harvest. It is the first letter on the page that inspiration and hard work will carry forward until the story, the essay, the book is done. It is the first instant that the passage of time and all that is done therein will transmute to history. It is the call of Reveille at dawn, the call to awake and be about the business of the day. It is the challenge to arise and strive to fulfill the promise of what may be. It is potential energy awaiting the direction and willpower that will accomplish whatever is decided upon. It is life, vitality, vigour, health, freshness. It is initiation. In a sense it is an aspect of the cyclical order of things. After the end, or at the point of the end commences the new cycle. The focus here is on the beginning, but as in all cyclical nature the beginning and the end are often the same point. 

<P>Luis Sight

<P>Luis is rowan, the opening of the eyes, gazing ahead, looking around, perceiving the prospects of reality all about. It is the noticing of what is there. It is the sentry standing vigilant at the gate of our mind, our heart. It is the watch moving with torches to light the darkness of the night. It is the alertness that helps ensure the safety of the city of self, the castle of well-being, whether individually or at the group level. This includes being aware not only of our individual needs at all levels (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual), but also the needs and the circumstances of the family, group, organization and of others around who influence us, who already or soon will interact with us. It illuminates the puzzles, the perplexities and riddles, casting light on the pages of the scroll of the knowledge of life. It is the means by which we walk safely along the road of understanding. It is how we recognize where we are and what was hidden by the shadows ahead which it scatters.

<P>Alder Forward

<P>Fern is alder, growth, determination, the bold step forward, the courageous advance to, through, past, over whatever obstacles may lie ahead. In the midst of battle, conflict, contention, competition, this is the shield of protection permitting the onward march following t the standards of right, duty, responsibility to victory. Leaving the harbour and fronting the unknown sea, this is the sturdy ship that will plow on regardless of the fiercest storms, despite anything that may lie in the deep, whatever the length of the journey. The hardy mariner on the sea of life delights in the firm alder supporting the vessel. Other aspects of this few include the possibility that there is danger. One may consider circumstances to determine whence may emerge danger and by what means this may be averted before serious contention arises.

<P>Sail Intuition

<P>Sail is willow, the slender, the graceful girl. It is the intuitive leap, vision and imagination. It is the dream and the quick realization of what the dream means. It is the moon moving through its cycles. It is the ebb and flow of the tides. it is woman. It is life. It is the wheel. It is the birth of a psychic circle, the opening of the pages of the book of mystery. It is the growth of vegatation. It is the development of the meditative, the psychic aspect of being. It is harmonizing together. It is progress in magical work, alone or with others. It is the supre-rational reaching of perception, whatever may be the reality revealed. One aspect of this few may be the suggestion that now is the time to pay greater heed to the intuitive, including dreams. Also, one may wish to ready oneself, including taking the practical measures, to be ready to respond to the inspiration permitting a period of artistic creativity. As in all sources of knowledge, balance is best, and one may also employ rational analysis of what suggestions seem to be conveyed. 

<P>Nin Bridge

<P>Nin is ash, the rainbow bridge, the means by which the conscious mind ascends towards the realm of the higher ones. It is the key that unlocks the treasuries of hidden knowledge, the key that starts the vehicle towards what is lofty, the key that opens the gate to the castle of the lords and ladies of Tir nan Og. It is the stairway to the heavens of our ancient ancestors. It is the ladder allowing us to climb up and reach for the apples high up on the Tree of Life. It is how we awake, conscious, alert approach the illuminated regions of the Otherworld. It is the mountaineer's rope by means of which we hoist ourselves ever higher in our journey towards the lofty peak. It is the winged steed we mount to fly high into the brilliant sky. There may be the aspect of being that has one attaining a different understanding. Another consideration is to
join humble awareness of one's finite limitations to any feeling one has gained a higher degree of capacity, etc. All are human and humble awareness of the fact is often a quite beneficial garment to wear.
 
<P>Huath Shelter

<P>Huath is whitethorn, is repose, rest, shelter. It is taking a breath after exertion. It is exhaling as one gazes out over the parapets of the keep. From behind the castle's wall may perhaps be seen that which drove one inside. Now is the time to gather strenth before venturing outside
again. Now is the time for training and discipline, for practising the necessary arts and skills we'll need when we emerge to continue our journey ahead, notwithstanding whatever forces may be arrayed as obstacles in the way. This is the time for relaxation. This is the rest house, the
caravanserai at the end of a hard day's travelling. This is comforting consolation. This is relief at the dangers and difficulties evaded. Even if one feels deeply wounded, one may be grateful for the life that one retains and for this opportunity to rest, recuperate and restore oneself to health, acquiring what will be needed in the stages left on the voyage through life. This is the warmth of the hearth fire at the close of a hard day's work, of a day of battling, and may the deities be with us on the morrow.

<P>Duir Champion

<P>Duir is oak, is champion, the liege of a lord. It is strength, the trained warrior, the veteran member of a High King's warband. It is one ready to lead the knights of his lord to battle and one able to demonstrate the essential qualities of a knight. It is one adorned with courtesy and with
the courtly values. It is gift-giving, generosity and hospitality. It is courage and leadership and the physical, mental and spiritual skills of the leader of warriors. It is not just the keen knowledge of tactics and strategy, but also the ability to determine when it is necessary to  engage in battle and when and how one can achieve the High King's goals by other means, including diplomacy. It is courtly speech, diplomatic conversation, understanding listening to whatever words are utterred in one's presence, a noble intent to resolve any contention, insightfully and peacefully if possible, though never surrendering the essential obligations entrusted to us, and ready to fight, if called upon to do so.

<P>Tinne Balance

<P>Tinne is holly, is balance, justice, the Middle Path, harmony, arbitration, retribution, karma, the other shoe, the just fight, courage, the compliment. It is that which balances the scales. It is the Golden Mean, the treading of the path between extremes, but especially it is that
which redresses imbalance, overcomes injustice, sets matters aright. It is attaining a greater viewpoint, being able to see more than one side of an issue and to attain the central point of agreement in any conflict, making resolution of the dispute possible. It is the clear and keen assessment of all the factors in any issue, legal, financial, scientific. In every aspect of life it is the all-considered, the well-resolved calculation. One aspect of this is the underlining of the possible requirement for one to be aware that decisions are now coming to the forefront in one's life and this is a time to ready oneself for thinking issues through and making informed choices.

<P>Coll Inspiration

<P>Coll is hazel, is inspiration, is the gleam of the idea as it leaps into the mind, is the well from which poetry and all the arts flow. It is the voice of the Muses sounding in the mind that will translate it into matter, physical form, solid substance, into music, song, drama, art,
structures, buildings, scientific applications, philosophical deductions, religious rites and rituals, philospohies and religions, to anything created by the inspired hand of humanity. It is meditation, not primarily the studied techniques of stilling the mind's many voices or of learning to focus on a particular item, however simple or complex, as in the fruit of meditation, what method and techniques soever one employs as seeds to grow this fruit.  It is that aspect of divination which is the dawning of perception about reality, so that we may tread our own paths creatively, walking, skipping, jogging, running, strolling, dancing creatively, reaching worthily for inspired reality. As every source of knowledge and awareness, inspiration calls for balanced assessment and conscious conscience. 

<P>Queirt Beauty

<P>Queirt is apple, is youth and beauty, is love, is life eternal, is the charm of the elf-mound, is the delight of the sound of the harp played at Tara, is the noble deed the bards will sing of you, is virtue unalloyed, is heart's leap at the lover's smile and the shining of the beloved's eyes driving all else from the mind, is the splendid verdure of the Isles of the Blessed, is happiness with no room for aught else, is the heart striding with seven league boots, is the Green Forest smiling beneath the warm rays of the beneficial sun after the blessings of life giving rain. This is the sound, the sight, the aroma, the taste the feel of perfect delight. While this is a time of great joy, one may also keep in mind that the cycle of life will continue and the wheel will turn. One may be mentally and otherwise prepared to live worthily in other phases of the cycle.

<P>Muin Weaving

<P>Muin is vine, is weaving, is patiently transforming what the past has given us into the garment fit to be worn now and in the future. The thoughts we think, the feelings of our heart blend together in patterns chosen to bedeck our beings in splendour. Growing from the soil of what we
had known, what we had experienced, in the bleak earth of sadness and sorrow, watered by all the tears we've shed and warmed by all the joy of our yesterdays and the smiles of our previous triumphs and success rises the vine of our being. Our tender attention will assist the growth of
this vine higher, sturdier, firmer and the maturing of the grapes growing there, the harvest of our deeds, a rich offering to the people we greet, who come to us as guests to sip the delight of the hospitality of our spirit.

<P>Gort Drum

<P>Gort is ivy, the drum. Sounds the warning. Hearken to its call. Ponder, if there's time, the path ahead. Ensure the bridge at your feet reaches safely to the other side. Take care others understand you, and you understand correctly the extent of their feelings towards you, and how these may flicker and change depending on circumstances, now obvious and soon to be disclosed. Pounding is the warning drum, pounding perhaps the hooves of the horses racing behind. Be ready to race ahead, if need be, to reach the stronghold, letting go of past impediments, or, on the other
hand, to swirl around, sword swiftly drawn from its sheath, to face the charging foe, or, indeed, even to turn palm raised in the sign of peace and tongue unloosed to conquer hostility. Sounds the warning drum. The trained and ready warrior, the alert traveller, will respond appropriately according to the situation.

<P>Ngetal Healing

<P>Ngetal is broom, health and healing. It is bathing in the waters of life, washing off the dust and dirt, cleansing our wounds. It is purifying the temple, cleaning up our room, tidying our abode, physical, mental, emotional, spiritual. It is both soaking in the relaxing, healthy warm water and vigorously scrubbing. It is calm contemplation and the laborious attempt to learn new things, the determined effort to understand all that we have learned. Cleaning up, tidying up means that we may find a new arrangement of our meals, of our exercise, of our periods and patterns of work and rest, of the furniture in our habitation and of the contents within our minds and hearts, with some old and possibly less wholesome material tossed away. One aspect of this few is readiness to assess just what of our previously valued possessions (including ideas and beliefs) remains beneficial and healthy now and for the future.

<P>Straiph Fate

<P>Straiph is blackthorn, fate, that which we are unable to avoid, powerless to prevent. What lies within our control is our understanding of the inflexible nature of this destiny and our response to it. Ours may be the knowledge of good and evil, the awareness of when it is not good to insist
on a specific course of action, when it is timely for our ship to be preserved in port while the typhoon moves across the sea, and when duty and honour call for us to face the unconquerable foe. Usually our choice is to accept the unalterable change and move on healthily, creatively, imaginatively, living, thriving, embellishing existence within this new environment. Among the unalterable aspects of life may be sickness, aging and death. Even here one may choose to live as well as one may within the circumstances one finds oneself. Many aging individuals are accomplishing many things these days they when young may not have thought possible. It is the same in other circumstances such as the loss of a lover or of employment. It is often possible to achieve greatly within circumstances that initially seem devastating.

<P>Ruis Life

<P>Ruis is elder, life. And the snows of winter melt and life springs from the ground. The wheel of destiny revolves and turns again. The little child walks with a cane towards birth again. The thrill of discovery, the beneficial new invention, the blessed contribution to human well-being
acquires other attributes, ceases to vitalize and again comes discovery. The house in which we dwell, our city, the land in which we live, this very envelope of flesh fade behind us as we move on and life continues. What is eternal is the cycle of life, the turning of the wheel, the
falling of the leaves of yesteryear so each June the vibrant forest welcomes all in green and every harvest is fresh and nourishing.

<P>Ailm Awareness

<P>Ailm is fir, health, energy, enthusiasm, vigorous perception. It is realizing the long term interests and consequences. It is taking the broader view, considering all the factors. It is awareness of how the one fits into the couple, the family, the group, into all the various groups
within the wider society at large, how the present fits into the vast scale of time, of whence we came and whither we are heading, not just us as individuals, but also as families, as a group, as groups, as a people. It is awareness at both the microcosmic level of one's own roots, present
vitality and future direction and of those of the collectivity. It is awareness of the horizon behind, the horizon ahead and of all between. It is the knowledge of good and evil, energizing the soul in the selection of the littlest detail along the path of existence, as well as the broadest
and most important choices.

<P>Onn Gathering

<P>Onn is furze, the gathering of what is required. It is the industry of the bee collecting what will result in honey. It is the scholar's search for books, for information, for knowledge. It is study, hard study. It is the gathering of individuals who will advance the goals of a group or of an organization. It is the means by which these objectives will be attained.  It is obtaining the hammars, the saws, the nails, the lumber, the carpenters required to turn the architect's vision into a material structure, a building solid and real. It includes the concept of direction, of knowing how to arrange, to order, to classify all that has been gathered. It includes the knowledge of how to lead harmoniously, understandingly, skillfully.

<P>Ur Romance

<P>Ur is heather, is romance, the realm of dreams, a level of the unconscious bubbling up towards the surface of realization. It can be fantasy, imagination, that which will never happen. It calls for inspired insight, considered judgement, active implementation of what is worthy. It is the architect's designs that are the heralds of solid and imposing edifaces if the effort is taken to transmute them from potential to kinetic reality. In one sense it is the ideal that inspires us in the real world to better our lot, to improve the world in which we live. In this sense it is the
bright-eyed volunteer in many organizations. It is that which generates such individuals, organizations and much of their activity. It is that which ought never be forgotten in all the detailed discussions and plans of such groups. This is also the image in the heart of love. May it ever remain fresh and clear as time and actual interaction create and sustain a couple. And, may it not blind one if its gleam is not meant to be reality. 

<P>Edad Triumph

<P>Edad is aspen, is victory, success and triumph. It is the overcoming of all obstacles. It is the runner attaining the line first. It is the warrior surging through the foe victoriously. It is winning despite the odds and those who would see us fail. It is achievement, whether recognized or not. It is discovery, whether applauded or not. Perhaps a prize will be attained, an award bestowed, high honour offerred. And the conquest does not depend on acclaim. Despite all impediments, regardless of all who would oppose, without thought of blame or praise, one enters
the contest, one reaches the goal, one strives for what is worthy and one rejoices at this noble conquest, even the success in dealing with a personal difficulty, something from the past or our own character now handled well. For it is often the case that the most challenging task, the
hardest and hence most worthy vistory is the overcoming of what is unworthy in self.

<P>Idad Soul

<P>Idad is yew, is soul, is the essence of our being that has been reborn, that rises above this physical form and will endure beyond the tomb. It is the clearest tie to our ancestral past. It may be seen as an aspect of genetics and heredity. Also, it may be seen in a more fundamental reincarnation. It may be seen in other understandings of life and death. It may be seen metaphorically as any major, or even minor, transformation and change. And among these various facets of change is included the eternal being that advances through the various stages, different
incarnations, retaining that precious spiritual quality that attracts us today to what was yesterday, generations ago, andwhat is destined to carry us forward into tomorrow and forward to the future, contributing what will embellish the days, the times yet to be.<p>
