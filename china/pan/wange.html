HISTORY OF THE FORMER HAN DYNASTY (v. 3, pp. 475-559) Pan Ku, trans.
Homer H. Dubs, Waverly Press, Baltimore, 1955

This separate file concerns ancillary Wang Mang material added to
chapters 11, 12 and 99. Page 475 is Dubs' introduction to chapter
24.

The Treatise on Foods and Grains (pp. 476-505) begins with the
empire prosperous and peaceful, with reference to Emperor Hsuan's
bestowal of an imperial seal to the Shan-yu of the Huns, with Wang
Mang changing this seal, degrading the Kou-t'ing King and raising
vast armies when these insults led to war. There is mention of land
reform, of the reduction of slavery and of the repeal of such
changes. Mentioned are: droughts, the military burden, attempted
famine relief and its failure at the hands of corrupt officials.

Described are the changes Wang Mang made to the coinage system,
introducing knife coins and abolishing them on becoming emperor.

   (Later) he changed and made (six) kinds (of money): gold, silver,
   tortoise-(shells), cowries, cash and spade-money p. 486

There were: one, ten, twenty, thirty, forty and fifty units of cash
(bronze); one catty of gold worth ten thousand; one liu (eight
taels) of silver worth one thousand, though a liu of shu-shih silver
was set at one thousand five hundred and eighty; tortoise shells in
values of one hundred, three hundred, five hundred, two thousand
five hundred and sixty; a pair of cowries at two hundred and
sixteen, fifty, thirty, ten and the smallest at three a piece; spade
money from one hundred to one thousand in ten denominations a
hundred apart.

Wang Mang, on meeting resistence to his new coinage system,
circulated only the bronze one and fifty units. He attempted to
regulate prices in the markets, to tax uncultivated land and the
unemployed. A ten per cent tax was imposed on:

   "Those who collect articles of any kind, birds, beasts, fish,
   turtles, or the various insects from the mountains, forests,
   streams, or marshes, together with those who rear or care for
   domestic animals, women who collect mulberry leaves, rear
   silkworms, weave, spin, or sew, laborers, artisans, physicians,
   shamans, diviners, invokers, together with (people who have)
   other recipes or skills, peddlers, traders, merchants who sit
   down and spread out (their wares) or who arrange them at stopping
   places, or who visit houses pp. 495-496

Salt, iron and liquor were imperial monopolies and one could obtain
state loans. Corrupt officials negated much of the humane intent of
Wang Mang's traditionally derived policies. There were coinage
changes throughout the reign and this severely affected people.
There was heavy punishment for criticizing or opposing the
circulation of the new money. Officials inadequately paid, drought,
barbarian invasions, locusts, banditry and Wang Mang's unsuccessful
financial policies led to depopulation.

Dubs comments on Wang Mang's economic policy in pages 506-536. He
notes the profound Confucianism of all Wang Mang's initiatives,
their attribution to traditional ways and the reinterpretation of
tradition, preserving its primacy, when modern failures occurred.

Such failures may be attributed to: significant underuse of metal in
coins fixed at high value (encouraging counterfeiting and
discouraging circulation); demonetizing replaced coins, though
people were paid two per cent of the value of their fifties;
inadequate amounts of land permitted under the land reform system
(the ch'ing system mentioned in Mencius, criticized by Dubs only for
the amount specified, not for the general principle of land
division, though in Wang Mang's application of it a significant
result was raising the land tax from one fifteenth to one tenth);
the effective imposition of new taxes on the poor through the
extension of monopolies (designated controls) and the actual new
income tax of 9 C.E.; the failure of officials, generally merchants
concerned with personal profit, to administer effectively the
commisions to ensure price stability.

Other measures are mentioned, including the diminution of government
salaries in hard times and special levies.

This section contains some interesting economic information, such as
the postulated Siberian origin for some of the gold Wang Mang
accumulated and the Roman Empire for another portion of it, the
estimate of Wang Mang's five million ounces of gold and Medieval
Europe's total maximum of three and three quarters million ounces.

Appendix Three (pp. 537-543) concerns kang-mao amulets worn at the
waist to avert disease and misfortune on unlucky days.

   In Han times, the word mao had a special significance. The
   character liu, which was the surname of the imperial clan, is
   made up of three characters mao, chin (metal), and knife (tao),
   as Wang Mang notes (cf. 99B: 7a & n. 7.2). Hence mao denoted the
   Han imperial house...It is then not surprising that Wang Mang and
   the Wei dynasty did away with these kang-mao amulets and that the
   Han emperors wore them. p. 540

Appendix IV (pp. 544-545) concerns eclipses during Wang Mang's time.

Appendix V (pp. 546-559) concerns eclipses during the Former Han
Dynasty.

These last parts of the book are fascinating, especially for the
opportunity to consider economic fundamentals and basic traits of
human character.
