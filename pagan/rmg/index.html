<h1>Red Maple Grove</h1>



Welcome to this subsidiary page for Red Maple Grove, the presence of ADF in Ottawa, Canada. This page was created several years ago as a supplement to our main page that, at that time, seemed down a lot. That page has been doing better lately. I'd largely forgotten about this, until this morning reading a request on an ADF e-list for online grove by-laws. I remembered the one here. A significant addition this morning here is the link to the grove's official page.<p> 

The purpose of Red Maple Grove is to provide an open opportunity for study and ritual for those interested in walking and exploring the druidic path. ADF actually has a wider than Celtic focus, including the whole of Indo-European Pagan tradition. Though most of our current members happen to be Celts, some of us have wide backgrounds and interests even wider than the IE tradition. May all strolling here enjoy what they encounter. <p> 

This page was begun on Monday, December 6, 2004 C.E. and initially includes a copy of Red Maple's bylaws from Samhain 2004, a copy of three rituals (Mabon 2002 and Lughnasad and Samhain 2004. This page was last updated on October 17, 2008 C.E. <p> 

Red Maple Grove began through the efforts of a number of Ottawa druidic types about a decade ago. Our first major exposure to ADF came through the ADF ritual conducted by Silver Fox Grove (ADF Montreal) in Ottawa, possibly for the Spring Equinox in 1999. Several of us gathered at the Tree Ring here for Bealtaine in 1999 and at that spot at the Summer Solstice of that year we had our first Red Maple Ritual.<p>
 
Since then we've conducted regular rituals, held informal discussion evenings, more structured dedicants' study sessions, participated in the Ottawa Pagan Conferences, maintain a grove e-list, etc.<p>
