Hi, Nathan.

Many thanks for your message inviting me to encourage Stephen Harper 
to provide good Canadian jobs. I appreciate all you've done for 
employment, etc. I understand this is election year and figure you 
know what's politically effective. I don't believe petitions to 
Stephen Harper will actually improve employment, etc. I feel it would 
be more beneficial to encourage widespread understanding that 
unemployment and underemployment are structural in this society, 
bolstering the self esteem of this structure's victims, and focusing 
positively their energy.

For example, Canada requires significant construction of low cost housing. 
Some of the unemployed, trained if necessary, could join some currently 
active construction workers donating time and effort to build these 
structures. And inspired by the altruistic purpose, some able to could 
donate land and materials at no or little cost.

I draw your attention to the 1883 visionary work "The Dominion in 1983," 
among whose points is that philanthropic patriots provided comfortable 
housing for the needy. That work has other interesting points surpassing 
what has actually been achieved by 2015. The Victorian author describes 
1983 Canada as a high tech northern nation (e.g. Churchill he sees as 
supporting a population of 200,000 with greenhouses and geothermal energy) 
visited by foreign scientists and engineers eager to learn from Canada's 
achievements.

In our actual 21st Century Canada, organization could stimulate the self 
esteem of the unemployed, initially encouraging their input on housing site 
selection (including strengthening areas further from the border), studying 
and teaching languages, literratures, cultures, etc., scientific and medical 
research, attracting support for housing (including perhaps from artistic 
and environmental sources, perhaps from space enthusiasts, attracted by 
opportunity to join in first steps to offplanet habitation; isolated Native 
communities could be transformed from current denigration to cutting edge 
prototypes of humanity's future), etc. All this would be keenly arranged to 
preclude opportunity for lapses of financial or other integrity.

I believe you are one who, despite the pressures you face on your time, can 
help turn the page to something more closely resembling Ralph Centennius' 
vision of Canada in 1983.

Thanks again for your message.

Very Best Wishes,

Michael
