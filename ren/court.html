The Book of the Courtier, Baldesar Castiglione, transl. Charles S.
Singleton, Doubleday, New York, 1959 (1516, 1528)

This consideration of the qualities of the ideal courtier is set in the
form of four evenings of conversation at the court of Urbino. It starts
with suggestions on what to discuss and the decision of this theme. The
topic is covered in four books, totalling in this translation volume of
some 360 pages. The content is briefly outlined below.

I He is nobly born, favoured by nature physically and mentally, skilled
in arms, wrestling, horsemanship, running and swimming. He is literate,
knows Latin and Greek, the poets, orators and historians. He can write
poetry and prose, especially in the vernacular. He can play musical
instruments and read music. He can paint, draw and sketch military
diagrams.

He aspires to honour and integrity, is moderate and immune to flattery.
He avoids affectation and excess. He has such skill and ease of doing
whatever is timely and appropriate that his nonchalance impresses all
who observe him.

II He knows how to order his whole life. He is prudent in speech and
deed, conscious that ambition often clouds judgement. He associates
with all without arousing envy. He is a good judge of himself and what
is apt.

He is gentle and pleasant in conversation, suiting this to the occasion
and to those present, as all are different. Aware of the excessive
tendencies of youth and old age, he seeks to avoid these. He is not a
prince's flatterer, nor ill-humoured, melancholy or taciturn before
him. He serves only good princes and obeys them only in that which is
honourable.

He adapts himself to the customs of the land where he is. He dresses as
he wills, though moderately and appropriate to his standing. Bright
colours belong over armour and as festive garb, black or dark is more
fitting as ordinary wear.

He chooses his friends carefully, is preceded by a good reputation and
makes a good first impression. He knows languages, especially in Italy
the much spoken French and Spannish.

He can tell humourous anecdotes and jokes and engage in witty repartee.
His humour is not directed at the wretched, those deserving punishment
instead, nor the powerful able to inflict harm. In verbal humour or
practical jokes he does what is fitting and respects the honour of
women.

III The ideal court lady is considered. She manages her house, children
and family well, is neat and clean, modest, chaste and one who neither
speaks nor listens to gossip. She is skilled in music, art and dance,
balanced in behaviour, able to participate in court conversations and
activities without casting doubt on her reputation.

Many examples are provided of virtuous women and examination in depth
of the courtier's and lady's behaviour when in love and on encountering
(false and true) professions of love.

IV The aim of the courtier is to attain the prince's mind and favour,
to be able to advise him accurately and truthfully, keeping him free
from any erroneous action. Others from enmity or fear fail to speak
truth to princes causing great harm through poor governance.

Of the three legitimate forms of government (monarchy, rule by the best
and popular government) monarchy is best, as seen from its opposite
(tyranny) being the worst. True liberty is not doing what we like, but
obeying good laws. A good prince is evidenced by the goodness of his
people. He strives hard to acquire knowledge. Bad rulers use force,
spies and fear. They sow discord to keep the people weak.

The goal of war is peace and of labour leisure. The prince's policy is
attaining his people's peace, prosperity and tranquility. The prince
will choose a council of wise and ethical advisors and let them speak
freely what is in the best interest of the state. The prince will see
there is balance in the land, avoiding extremes of wealth and poverty.

There is a discussion of the courtier in love, attracted to worthy
mental and spiritual qualities, as well as physical beauty. Also, very
impressed by the beautiful natural environment, God's magnificent
handiwork, he is attracted to God.

This is a highly significant text, providing a glimpse of a lively
Renaissance court and the ideals of the political adviser of that very
energetic time whence comes many attitudes and forms of modern life.
