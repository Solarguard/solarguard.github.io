McAuliffe, SUNY, Albany, 1995.

Translator's Foreward: Abu Ja'Far al Mansur reigned 21 years. His first
decade witnessed his determined elimination of three opponents. At
Tabari is at times brief, for example, mentioning in one sentence Abd ar
Rahman's flight to Spain and founding of the Umayyad dynasty there. Al
Mansur founded Baghdad. At Tabari aptly portrays personal traits and
effectively uses correspondence. His sources include al Mada'ini, al
Waqidi and al Numayri.

succession to the Caliphate. Abu Muslim assured him he would take care
of the rebellious.

Doubting loyalties on Abu Muslim's approach Abdallah killed many. Abu
Muslim confronted Abdallah ibn Ali for several months, then put him to

each other. Abu Muslim hesitantly went to Abu Ja'far who killed him.

A.H. 145 (1/4/762-20/3/763): Abu Ja'far continued opposing descendants
of the Prophet.

Selecting a site accessible to wide ranging trade, conducive to health
and predicted to have him found there a city, Abu Ja'far began Baghdad.

Abu Ja'far keenly sought Ibrahim ibn Abdallah. Ibrahim had help evading
the intense search. He reached Basrah, led a revolt and died fighting.

At Tabari 30, "The Abbasid Caliphate in Equilibrium, transl. C.E. 
Bosworth, SUNY, Albany, 1989

Translator's Foreward: This volume covers Musa al Hadi's fifteen
months and Harun ar Rashid's twenty three years and geography from
Morocco to Transoxiana. Alids stayed restless. Byzantine internal
instability notwithstanding, that frontier remained relatively
stable. There was expansion eastwards, disquiet stirred by taxes,
the astonishing fall of the powerful Barmakis and the legendary
splendour of Harun's patronage of the arts. At Tabari here drew on 
Hisham ibn al Kalbi, Waqqidi, etc. and he quotes documents.

A.H. 169 (14/7/785-2/7/786) Continued: harun (as Yahya ibn Khalid 
al Barmaki advised) secretly buried al Mahdi, paid each soldier
two hundred dirhams and let them return to Baghdad. There they 
learned of the caliph's death and became calm on receiving more 
money. Loyalty was sworn to al Hadi with Harun heir.

Al Hadi persecuted Zindiqs. An Alid revolt was quelled. Idris
escaped and aided by the post manager made his way to Morocco.
Harun had him assassinated.

A.H. 170 (3/7/786-21/6/787): Rawh ibn Hatim became governor of
Ifriqiyah on Yazid's death. Al Hadi asserted his independence 
from his mother's influence, forbade her involvement in politics,
threatened the heir's succession and was killed by two slave
girls. Some say that al Hadi had made overtures to Harun. There
was a dream foretelling a short reign for al Hadi and a long one 
for Harun. Al Mamun was born on the night al Hadi died.

Related are some thirty pages of al Hadi anecdotes.
