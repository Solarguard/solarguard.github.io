STORM OVER WARLOCK, Andre Norton, Ace, New York, 1960

Shann Lantee is the sole survivor of a Terran survey camp on the planet
Warlock in the Circe system. A war is raging between Terrans and Throgs
and young Lantee is thrown onto his own resources on this inhabited
world whose indigenous population is aloof from both offworld peoples.
This is a tale of magic and fantasy, of the mysterious psychic powers
possessed by the Wyverns (Warlocks aboriginals) and, as many a very
entertaining Norton, of the inner resources of the young protagonist
who ultimately prevails despite the obstacles confronting him.

ORDEAL IN OTHERWHERE, Andre Norton, Ace, New York, 1964

Charis Nordholm has survived plague and the narrow mindedness of the
local population on Demeter. Her father had been the educator there,
before sickness carried him off. She, feeling very trapped, welcomes the
arrival of a ship. It's not the Patrol, but a Free Trader. Her spirits
sag when she realizes they're not intent on providing her a chance at
freedom, but rather at forcing her to sign an oppressive labour
contract. She has little option, as this is the path leading offworld.
She is brought to Warlock where she enters the action, adventure,
mystery and magic of that planet where Shann Lantee also awaits her.
These are typical Norton novels, well spun yarns in a background of
interstellar exploration and expansion of knowledge, including greater
awareness of psychic abilities.
