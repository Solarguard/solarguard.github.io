<h2>G.-F. MULLER AND THE IMPERIAL RUSSIAN ACADEMY</h2>

<P>J.L. Black, McGill-Queen's University Press, Kingston and Montreal, 1986

<P>This review begins with an anecdote concerning how I came to acquire my copy of this book. Those wishing to read only the review proper may skip the next four paragraphs.

<P>One summer in the early 1990s, no later than 1995, when I was in Ottawa while the rest of the family went to Toronto for a week to visit relatives, I went to the Ottawa Public Library. There, one of the books I saw was this one about Muller. I had already read a biography of Lomonosov and was very interested in the topic. I took this book home, read it and found it so appealing that I decided to order a copy. So, I phoned a bookstore to place my order. Had the clerk replied that the book cost forty dollars, I would have asked no questions. However, she stated that the book could be ordered for 29.95 US which came to 39.95 Canadian. However, holding the library copy of the book as I spoke with her, I could see that it had been published in Canada. I asked why they were mentioning American prices for a Canadian book. She said she would check into it and get back to me. She phoned back to say I could have the book for 29.95 Canadian. I said that I would take it.

<P>A few weeks later, I received a call informing me that the book was in and available for 29.95 US, that's 39.95 Canadian. I replied that I had already been assured that I could have the book, a Canadian publication, for 29.95 Canadian. When she insisted the price was 29.95 US, I said she had a sale at the Canadian price, but not the US one. She was not happy, but decided to keep the book rather than sell it for the previously agreed upon price.

<P>Then, at New Year's 1996, I accompanied the rest of the family to Toronto. While at my mother-in-law's place, I opened the phone book, wrote down some names and addresses of bookstores and surprised my wife, born in Toronto and well aware of my lack of knowledge of the city, by dashing off alone for a spell to hunt for books. It seemed I surprised Torontonians who heard me say I was setting out from this bookstore to walk to that one, etc. "But it's too cold; you can't walk like that." "It's okay," I replied. "I'm from Ottawa." The temperature was merely minus fifteen or minus eighteen, no trouble for us, though it seemed to bother them.

<P>Anyway, one of the bookstores I entered was a second hand store with a great selection of academic books, including this one about Muller. I was delighted to have it and, though it was in very good condition, it was second hand, so it was marked down and became mine for 19.95, Canadian, of course.

<P>This very fascinating look at the beginnings of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the second great expedition of Bering and the accumulation of knowledge and source material about Siberian history and peoples as seen through the eyes of that energetic historian who played so central a role in these features of the Russian Enlightenment is a pleasure to read. 

<P>Chapter One, "Leipzig and the Imperial Russian Academy 1705-1731" (pp. 3-28), describes Muller's early life, time at university in Leipzig and his invitation to, arrival in and first years in St. Petersburg. It also mentions his year long tour, 1730-1731, in Europe and England. Among the chapter's interesting points are that several Tibetan manuscripts were brought to Paris in 1721 as evidence of Russian explorations in Central Asia, that the some 1,600 books of Peter the Great were received by the Academy of Sciences in 1725, the year of Peter's death, that Muller arrived in St. Petersburg in November 1725, that he was elected to the British Royal Society in 1730 and that he was not promptly reimbursed for his year of travel, during which he purchased books and instruments for the Academy.

<P>Chapter Two, "Fledgling Historian at the Academy 1731-1733" (pp. 29-44), describes his choice to study intently the history of his new homeland. The chapter mentions the historical background and other historians of his day, including Mankiev and Tatishchev.

<P><blockquote>Although he showed an interest in the subject from the first decade of the 		eighteenth century, Tatishchev began to write the history seriously only in 1729 and was not able to submit a draft of his work to the Academy until January 1740; a more complete version was ready in 1746.  For the next thirty years, the long manuscript provided ammunition for debate between proponents of different interpretations of Russia's antiquity. It contained extensive extracts from and reproductions of entire chronicles, including some that were lost forever in a fire of 1750. Tatishchev's thoroughness in bringing together information from both foreign and Russian sources -- he boasted of having used more than a thousand books -- made his material especially valuable to researchers. p. 38</blockquote>

<P>Chapter Three, "A Land and Its Past 1733-1743" (pp. 47-77) is the fascinating account of Muller's decade in Siberia in connection with the Second Kamchatka Expedition. Although he did not go to Kamchatka, he did strenuously explore Siberia, seeking out, copying and preserving old documents throughout the land.

<P>Among the chapter's interesting details are: the academicians and their party setting out from St. Petersburg four months after Bering and six after Bering's second had departed with the heavy equipment, Muller's high praise of the leather works in Kazan and a fabric factory there employing 
over a thousand people, his ethnological and linguistic work, including on the Kalmyks, Uzbeks, Tatars, Chuvash, Buryats, Tunguses, Ostyaks, Voguls and Samoyeds, the poor quality of air in winter in Krasnoyarsk as vapours from stoves are emitted into rooms to avoid heat loss, inhabitants near Lake Baikal offering coins to the sacred lake, the bribing of Tatars to obtain artifacts from ancestral tombs, and Muller's report to Bering.

<P><blockquote>Muller did present Bering with a report based on information that he gathered from explorers, sailors, and the Iakutsk archives on the "frozen sea" supposedly separating Asia and America. He even found reports of annual seventeenth-century voyages from the Lena to the Kolyma. One account reported that a small boat with S.I. Dezhnev as captain had sailed from the Kolyma around the Chukotka Peninsula to the mouth of the Anadyr in 1648, thereby preceding Bering through the Bering Straits by nearly a century. pp. 67-68</blockquote>

<P>The chapter mentions Bering's voyage to Alaska and his death in 1741. It also tells of Muller's illness in Siberia, his marriage in Turinsk on the way back and the impressions made on him by the hospitable Demidov family. Muller's meticulous and energetic scholarship is evident in his detailed guide of 1,200 points to his successor in Siberia, J.E. Fischer, and in the voluminous harvest of his travels.

<P><blockquote>His completed and catalogued collections included forty-two books of documents on the history and geography of Siberia, four books of chronicles, and books of description of Siberia (ten prepared by Muller himself and three compiled by his students and overseen by him) and a large quantity of maps, drawings and city plans. p. 76</blockquote>

<P>Chapter Four, "Historiographer 1743-8" (pp. 81-108), begins with Muller's ill health on his return from Siberia and his testing of the political climate. A new Empress had come to the throne, backed by Russian nobles in contrast to the heavily German composition of the previous dominant faction. Muller encountered antagonistically the brilliant Russian Mikhail Lomonosov. The chapter and the book provide some material for readers interested in details of individual and factional clashes among the founding and early members of the Academy. Central to its key theme of historiography is Muller's proposal to the president of the Academy on August 7, 1746:

<P><blockquote>Muller recommended that the following collection be organized: (1) all "written historical books, that is, the KNIGA STEPENAIA, chronicles, and chronographs, both about Russia generally, and about its different parts"; (2) books on Tatar history in the Tatar, Turkish, and Persian languages; (3) a centralized document depository; (4) the lives of the saints in Church books, many of which belonged to noble families; (5) reports and documents that dealt with the founding of churches and monasteries; (6) grave-site and other inscriptions in Moscovite churches and monasteries and in other Russian towns; (7) genealogical books of princely and noble families that have had some significance for Russian history; (8) anything from Russian antiquity, no matter how insignificant it may seem; (9) legends and folk-tales, which were not to be taken literally; and (10) foreign books about Russia, Lithuania, Courland, Prussia, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Turkey, Persia, and China. This list is perfectly representative of the techniques advocated by the new nationalist historians of the Aufklarung. p. 91</blockquote>

<P>The chapter mentions Muller's many activities at the time and some complications that could easily arise, for example in his rejection of Krekshin's genealogy of the princes of Russia. Krekshin responded by charging Muller with portraying Russia poorly. A committee investigated. Even though the committee members, including Lomonosov, were not friendly to Muller, they agreed with his assessment of Krekshin's work.

<P>The chapter describes reorganization at the Academy and some practical situtions, such as German and Latin continuing as the languages of Academy meetings until the 1770s, despite orders making Russian and Latin the official languages.

<P>Next comes reference to Muller's appointments as Academy historiographer and rector of the university. His efforts to publish his history of Siberia aroused fierce opposition from nationalists objecting strongly to its lack of patriotism. There is discussion then of Tatishchev's history, Tatishchev's approval of Muller's work, Lomonosov's support of Tatishchev's history and Muller's concern that Tatishchev's material be preserved.

<P><blockquote>Muller urged the Academy to assure the preservation of Tatishchev's large collection of some one thousand books and documents, either by bringing them to St. Petersburg or by having them copied. Tatishchev was old and unwell, and Muller was afraid that the documentation would be lost if its owner died suddenly. The collection included many items that Muller had not seen during his own tour of Siberia, but were noted in Tatishchev's manuscripts. As usual, however, Schumacher and Teplov failed to act on Muller's pleas, and shortly after Tatishchev's death in July 1750, a large part of his library was destroyed by fire. pp. 105-106</blockquote>

<P>Chapter Five, "Debate on "Russian" Origins 1749-1755" (pp. 109-122) mentions Muller's ruffling of nationalist feathers by his Normanist perspective that early Russian leaders were  Scandinavians. Muller's view of history as an objective account of what took place clashed with the concept that it was more important to foster the honour of the homeland. Muller did defend Russia, the Academy, Bering and the Second Kamchatka Expedition against critical reports in Western Europe.

<P>Chapter Six, "Monthly Compositions 1755-1764" (pp. 123-158), describes this journal and Muller's work as editor. The publication was a great transmitter to the Russian reader of much interesting material, including the history and geography of the Empire.

<P><blockquote>The September 1755 edition of MONTHLY COMPOSITIONS carried the first of a detailed six-part series by Muller on trade in Siberia... The series included a list and description of Siberian cities and trade routes, enumerated the various goods bartered by Siberian, Kalmyk, Bukharan, and Chinese traders, and noted the main periods of contact between Russians and the peoples of Siberia.... 

<P>Other essays by Muller carried a wealth of information on the various peoples of Siberia, on the first Russian travellers to China (from 1608), on three "heathen" tribes of the Kazan district (Cheremis, Chuvash, Votiaks), on the whale fisheries of Kamchatka, on gold mining in Bukhara, and on Peter the Great's fortresses along the Irtysh. Muller also described items found in grave sites in Siberia and New Russia. Another exhaustive series in which he depicted Russian voyages in the Arctic and Pacific from 1636 to 1745 appeared in ten parts, 1757-8. p. 133</blockquote>

<P>Other material by Muller in MONTHLY COMPOSITIONS included a description of the region of the Amur River, exploration in the Far East, the Cossacks, the Time of Troubles (1598-1613) and the history of Novgorod. Sometimes he drew reaction from nationalists such as Lomonosov responding to perceived slights to Russian pride. The chapter also describes the changes in official attitude with the accession of the capable Catherine II, more appreciative of learning and of Muller than had been her immediate predecessors. And a glimpse is provided of the international atmosphere of Muller's household.

<P>Chapter Seven, "Educator and Academy Deputy 1765-8" (pp. 161-176), describes Muller's move to Moscow, his views on and involvement in education, his increasing acceptance and security and such details as his seven audiences with the Empress in 1767 and her granting him access to the 36,000 volumes of the J.A. Korff library which she had given to Duke Paul.

<P>Chapter Eight, "Archivist, Historian, Publicist 1769-1783" (pp. 177-197), mentions Muller's continuing work in these areas, including his cataloguing of the large Golitsyn family library, his 500 page work, replete with a hundred pages of genealogical charts, on Russia's old nobility and his history of Little Russia and Zaporozhye, "The first detailed Russian history of the Cossacks and Ukraine." p. 191

<P>The Epilogue, "Muller and Russian Historiography" (pp. 200-213), looks at the scholar and his influence on historiography in Russia. Its final paragraph is perhaps a worthy eulogy:

<P><blockquote>Thus Muller was prophetic when he wrote in 1764 that Russia had "enough material...chronicles, chronographs, books of rank, genealogies, embassy records, military and ceremonial papers, and other lists... When all of this is carefully prepared in printed productions, only then, and not before, will historical writers be in a position to create a proper history of Russia." But it was still nearly a century before the great multi-volume histories of Russia, above all S. M. Solov'ev's, and the important juridicial-historical works by K.D. Kavelin, B.N. Chicherin, and others, could demonstrate the full maturity of historical writing in Russia. And these men looked to Muller as their most important predecessor among historians whose careers were made in Russia. p. 213</blockquote>

<P>There are also two appendices, the advice Muller received on his departure to Russia from his father and Muller's forward to the first issue of MONTHLY COMPOSITIONS.

<P>This look at Muller, a quite worthy addition to works focusing on Peter the Great, the great Lomonosov and Catherine the Great, is highly recommended.<p>
