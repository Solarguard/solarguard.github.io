THE NATIVE TRIBES OF CENTRAL AUSTRALIA, Baldwin Spencer and F.J. 
Gillen, Dover, New York, 1968 (1899)

The blurb at the back calls this, "One of the dozen or so greatest 
ethnographic accounts in the entire literature of anthropology." And, 
it is indeed a fascinating look at Aboriginal life by two initiates 
of the Arunta tribe conscious of the devastating impact of European 
civilization on those Aborigines in closer proximity to it.

Chapter One, "Introduction" (pp. 1-54) begins by presenting the land to
the reader.

   The native tribes with which we are dealing occupy an area in the  
   centre of the Australian continent which, roughly speaking, is not 
   less than 700 miles in length from north to south, and stretches   
   out east and west of the transcontinental telegraph line, covering 
   an unknown extent of country in either direction. p. 1

There are Lower Steppes and Higher Steppes and true desert and gibber 
(stone) plains, creeks subject to flash flooding, plants and animals 
that survive by growing quickly so they can in time deeply drive 
their roots or burrow. There are ranges rising to 5,000 feet of 
elevation running for several hundred miles,

   separated from one another by valleys, varying in width from 200   
   or 300 yards to twenty miles... p. 5

In the desert:

   Every now and then are found, right in the heart of the            
   sand-hills,  small patches of limestone, in each of which is a     
   deep pit-like excavation, at the bottom of which there may or may  
   not be a little pool of water, though such "native wells", as they 
   are called, are of rare occurrence and are the remnants of old     
   mound springs. More likely than not, the little water which one    
   does contain is foul with the decaying carcase of a dingo which    
   has ventured down for a drink and has been two weak to clamber out 
   again. p. 6

Except in desert, game is plentiful. Aborigines are adept at finding 
water, for example from tree rooots.

   Each of the various tribes speaks a distinct dialect, and regards  
   itself as the possessor of the country in which it lives. p. 7 

The tribes are divided into groups, each occupying its own territory. 
There are three influential positions: medicine men, spirit 
communicators and headmen. Each group has an hereditary headman whose 
chief responsibility is caring for the ertnatulunga ("Sacred 
store-house" p. 9) off-limits to the uninitiated, including women and 
children. While tradition is very important, men of ability can 
introduce innovations and legends speak of capable ancestors altering 
traditional ways.

Aborigines are unclothed, prefer small fires which do not drive them 
back and will lounge while food is plentiful, gathering and hunting 
according to need. There are several pages on hunting, tracking and 
cooking techniques, as well as tools and weapons, including the 
spear-thrower and boomerang. As to ornament, a man wears:

   a waste belt made of human hair -- usually provided by his         
   mother-in-law. On his forehead, stretched across from ear to ear,  
   is a chilara or broad band made of parallel strands of fur string, 
   and around his neck he will have one or more rings similar to      
   those worn by the women. His hair will be well greased and also    
   red ochred... p. 30

The authors describe physical aspects, including the hair and beard 
and the body scars on both males and females. Often such scars are 
evidence of mourning. Although Aboriginal morality varies from that 
of Europeans, the native standards are upheld, sometimes by capital 
punishment, also the penalty for magical murder.  

   no such thing as natural death is realized by the native; a man    
   who dies has of necessity been killed by some other man, or        
   perhaps even by a woman, and sooner or later that man or woman     
   will be attacked. In the normal condition of the tribe every death 
   meant the killing of another individual. p. 48

They proceed with comments about generosity, focus on the group 
rather than on the individual, concern for children and the elderly.

   There is no such thing as doing away with aged or infirm people;   
   on the contrary such are treated with especial kindness, receiving 
   a share of the food which they are unable to procure for           
   themselves. p. 51

There is some infanticide, including of twins. The chapter concludes 
with comments about the normal carefree nature of Aborigines and the 
probable common origin of various tribes.

   It may be said that, as far as we are yet acquainted with their    
   customs, the various tribes may be regarded as descended from      
   ancestors who observed in common with one another certain customs, 
   and were regulated by a definite social system which was at one    
   time common to them all. In course of time, as they wandered over  
   the continent and became divided into groups, locally isolated to  
   a large extent from one another, these groups developed along      
   different lines. p. 54

Chapter Two, "The Social Organization of the Tribes" (pp. 55-91), 
begins by mentioning, "The division of the tribe into two exogamous 
inter-marrying groups." p. 55 There is reference to mothers naming 
children after the locality where the mother feels conception 
occurred. Proceeding to state that words such as "Mother" and 
"Father" have a group rather than an individual significance, they 
look at the Urabunna tribe:

   The whole tribe is divided up into two exogamous intermarrying     
   classes, which are respectively called Matthurie and Kirarawa, and 
   the members of each of these again are divided into a series of    
   totemic groups, for which the native name is Thunthunnie. pp. 59-60

It is uncertain that only women of one specific totem are available 
to men of a particular totem. Women of the Crow totem marry men of 
the Cicada totem, but the authors are unsure whether other totems in 
the Kirarawa class are available to the Cicada. There are further 
considerations, including the one that a spouse must be selected from 
one's own generation. While one may have a wife or two from the right 
categories, actually any such woman may be available under certain 
circumstances, and similarily one's wife or wives may also be 
available to other men of one's categories.

The chapter provides tables of terms of relationship. These underline 
group rather than individual identification even for such terms as 
father (includes father's brothers, blood and tribal) and wife 
(includes father's elder sisters' daughters, blood and tribal). It 
looks at how a member of the Urabunna tribe would fit into the Arunta 
tribe. It looks at the system of the Arunta and other tribes with the 
same organization. Its tables, a page or so long for each tribe, with 
some two dozen terms, show in general a correspondence with merely a 
linguistic difference in the term. For example, the Arunta word is 
okilia, the Luritcha word is kurta, the Kaitish word is alkiriia, the 
Warramunga word is papiati and the Urabunna word is nuthie and in 
each case this means elder brothers and the sons of father's elder 
brothers.

Chapter Three (pp. 92-112) concerns marriage. it begins by mentioning 
special occasions during which one may have sex with a person 
normally unavailable. One such time is when a women arrives at a 
marriageable age. She is then ceremonially made a woman by means of a 
stone knife and the men present have intercourse with her.

   When it is over the woman's head is decorated, by the Ipmunna man  
   who operated, with head bands and tufts of Alpita, the neck with   
   necklaces, the arms with bands of fur string, and her body is      
   painted all over with a mixture of fat and red ochre. Thus         
   decorated, she is taken to the camp of her special Unawa by the    
   men who have taken part in the ceremony and who have meanwhile     
   painted themselves with charcoal. p. 93

Another such occasion is that messengers among the Urabunna will 
include a woman or women available to all the men visited, if the 
response to the message is favourable. There is little jealousy among 
Aborigines, and while there may be serious consequences, including 
death, for violating sexual taboos, this is for breaking custom, not 
because of jealousy.

Chapter Four, "The Totems" (pp. 112-127), begins by mentioning each 
person is born into a totem:

   usually an animal or plant; but in addition to those of living     
   things, there are also such totem names as wind, sun, water, or    
   cloud -- in fact there is scarcely an object, animate or           
   inanimate, to be found in the country occupied by the natives      
   which does not gives (sic) its name to some totemic group of       
   individuals. p. 112

Tradition has it that on the death of totemic ancestors there arose 
natural features and the spirits of the ancestors went into sacred 
stones (churinga or bull-roarers).

   Either where they originated and stayed, as in the case of certain 
   of the witchetty grub people, or else where, during their          
   wanderings, they camped for a time, there were formed what the     
   natives call Oknanikilla, each one of which is in reality a local  
   totem centre. At each of these spots, and they are all well known  
   to the old men, who pass the knowledge on from generation to       
   generation, a certain number of the Alcheringa ancestors went into 
   the ground, each one carrying his Churinga with him. His body      
   died, but some natural feature, such as a rock or a tree, arose to 
   mark the spot, while his spirit part remained in the Churinga. At  
   the same time many of the Churinga which they carried with them,   
   and each one of which had associated with it a spirit individual,  
   were placed in the ground, some natural object again marking the   
   spot. The result is that, as we follow their wanderings, we find   
   that the whole country is dotted over with Oknanikilla, or local   
   totem centres, at each of which are deposited a number of          
   Churinga, with spirit individuals associated with them. p. 123

These ancestral spirits enter a woman conceiving in their locality. 
This explains a child's totem.

Chapter Five (pp. 128-166) concerns Churinga. Each Aborigine has a 
Churinga, though women may not be aware of the fact. The objects may 
be lent to a friendly tribe. They were never stolen, except by white 
men and then,

   the men in the group to which they belonged stayed in camp for two 
   weeks weeping and mourning over their loss and plastering          
   themselves over with white pipeclay, the emblem of mourning for    
   the dead. p. 136

It proceeds with discussion of the secret name bestowed upon each new 
born baby, communicated to an initiate having the proper discretion 
in a ceremony containing chants about the Alcheringa and after the 
initiate has been shown secret sacred objects and told of those 
ancestors to whom they pertain and later only ever whispered on 
special occasions and then never in the presence of anyone of another 
totem.

It mentions the distinction between a churinga carried by a messenger 
as an emblem of office and a message stick.

   In the great majority of cases the Churinga, wooden ones and stone 
   alike, have patterns incised on their surfaces, the tool used      
   being usually an incisor tooth of an opossum...p. 144

   The whole design consists, with few exceptions, of a conventional  
   arrangement of circular, semi-circular, spiral, curved and         
   straight lines together often with dots. p. 145

The same symbols are used with different meanings by the various 
totem groups. A totem group may temporarily cease to have living 
representation, but at any time a woman may feel she has conceived in 
the area and a baby be born having a spirit of that totem.

There is a several page description of the borrowing and return of 
churinga. The process begins with a messenger offering a few churinga 
to a headman who will not accept, unless he is willing to lend more 
in return. There is ceremony and gravity on the return of churinga 
borrowed, this return possibly two years after the borrowing.

Chapter Six, "Intichiuma Ceremonies" (pp. 167-211), begins by 
referring to the custom of holding such ceremonies for the increase 
of the totem plant or animal. These are usually held at the rainy 
season, though especially for the Rain or Water totem a prolonged 
drought may be the occasion for the performance of the ceremony. 
There follows an outline of these ceremonies by each of the following 
totems: Witchetty Grub, Emu, Hakea Flower, Manna, Honey-ant, Water 
and Kangaroo. The ceremonies differ greatly among the totems. Thus, 
for example, while members of the Witchetty Grub totem fast 
throughout the ritual, avoiding food, members of the Water totem eat, 
but are strictly forbidden water. Among characteristics of the 
Witchetty Grub ceremonies:

   Every man has left all his weapons in the camp, for all must go    
   quite unarmed and without any decoration of any kind; even the     
   hair girdle, the one constant article of clothing worn by the men, 
   must be left in camp. p. 171

   The totem Ilkinia or sacred design is painted on the body of each  
   man with red ochre and pipe clay, and the latter is also used to   
   paint the face, except for the median line of red. When the        
   decorations are complete a start is again made, all walking in     
   single file...p.175

   The old man, who had been left in charge at the camp during the    
   absence of the party, is also on the look-out for the return of    
   the latter. While the men have been away he has built, away from   
   the main camp, a long, narrow wurley, which is called Umbana, and  
   is intended to represent the chrysalis case from which the Maegwa  
   or fully-developed insect emerges.
   p. 176

Other interesting characteristics of the various totem ceremonies 
include: the use of human blood on sacred ground, the use of large 
churinga, several feet long, and the women of one moiety ensuring 
those of the other lie face down.

Chapter Seven, "Initiation Ceremonies" (pp. 212-270), enumerates the 
four Arunta and Ilpiarra ceremonies: throwing in the air, 
circumcission, subincission and fire.

   One of the most noticeable features of the ceremonies from a       
   negative point of view, is the absence of the knocking out of      
   teeth as a general custom associated with the initiatory rites.    
   Amongst many tribes of the eastern coastal district this forms a   
   prominent feature, but amongst the Central Australian natives,     
   whilst it may be performed, it has nothing to do with initiation,  
   and is, in fact, practised by men as well as women, the rite       
   having no sacred significance of any kind...
   p. 213

Tossed into the air to promote his growth, a boy of about ten or 
twelve has reached the time to move to the men's camp and to begin to 
hunt. Varied are details of initiation ceremonies and detailed the 
some thirty pages account here of the circumcision ceremony lasting 
at least nine days.

Having gathered much food, men carry the young one to ceremonial 
ground. Now, uniquely bearing shields, women dance. He is painted and 
informed he is now Wurtja. He is cautioned to secrecy, warned that 
otherwise the Great Spirit will carry him off. There is vigorous 
dancing and singing till daybreak, a woman handing him a firestick 
for which to care, the passage of three relatively uneventful days, 
his blindfolding and lying face down, opening his eyes to observe 
performances representing happenings in Alcheringa times, hunting, 
singing about wandering Alcheringa ancestors, important dances, 
rubbing with red ochre, some men opening their veins, showing him 
sacred objects, him carried off by women and held by them for half an 
hour, women coming, backoning after the men have regained him, the 
making of poles, the tying of twigs to him, the arrival of shield 
bearing women driven off by bark hurling men, men decorating 
themselves, decorating him and placing two bunches of owl feathers in 
his hair, women arriving, his flight with two men, two women erasing 
with their foreheads the drawing on him, lighting a fire, the sound 
of the Great Spirit Twanyirika putting the women to flight, him 
raised on a shield, his foreskin pulled and cut, the blood flowing 
into the shield, bull-roarers pressed on the wound and the secret 
information conveyed to him that they, not Twanyirika, made the 
sound, his viewing a bundle of wooden churinga, his now being not 
Wurtja but Arakurta, his mother to aid his recovery greasing her body 
and avoiding intercourse with his father, the foreskin either 
swallowed by a younger brother or dried up, smeared with red ochre 
and worn from the neck by a sister.

In the specific ceremony witnessed by the authors, the surgeon, 
pleading failing eyesight had requested his son perform the operation.

   This necessitated a long whispered consultation, not that there    
   was any serious objection to the proposal; indeed the old man is   
   regarded as so great a man in the tribe, being recognized as an    
   oknirabata, that no one would dream of opposing his wish in a      
   matter such as this, but simply because anything like hasty        
   action, in connection with an affair of serious import like one of 
   the initiation ceremonies, would be completely out of              
   keeping...pp. 241-242

While the Arakurta recovers men come and bite his head and chin 
("Until blood flows freely" p. 251) to promote hair growth. When he 
is recovered, usually in five to six weeks, another very important 
ceremony occurs -- incision. Men gather in the bush where he has been 
staying since his circumcision. He lies down. There is singing till 
daybreak, a performance of Alcheringa times. He is lain on top of 
others. Someone stretches his urethra which is cut. He is told he is 
now Ertwa-kurtwa and this was his final operation, although others 
present may choose to be cut again. He sits on a shield and the blood 
flows into the haft and is emptied into a fire. The shouting of the 
men on his operation is heard by the women and now his mother-in-law, 
sisters and aunts may be cut so as to cause cicatrices across the 
stomachs and shoulders. The men go towards the main camp singing. The 
women come dancing. He runs towards the women then whirls towards the 
bush.

   Before it is light the Ertwa-kurka is dressed up by Okilia and     
   Umbirna men with all the ornaments such as forehead band, arm      
   strings, tail tips, etc., which are worn by a native beau. He is   
   also provided with a shield and spear-thrower... p. 258

Women press their hands on his shoulders, rub their faces on his back 
and cut off locks of his hair. The next day he tosses a boomerang 
towards where his mother dwelt in an Alcheringa incarnation. He hunts 
before speaking to anyone.

There follow several pages of variant details in other parts of the 
tribe and in other regions of Australia. There is the observation 
that such ceremonies stretch back into the distant past, cannot be 
connected with population control which they don't, that Aborigines 
don't connect intercourse with birth, and that newborns are killed if 
there is an older sibling still nursing.

Chapters Eight (pp. 271-322) and Nine (323-386) concern the Engwura, 
the last initiation ceremony, ordeal by fire.

   Some idea of the importance of the ceremony may be gathered from   
   the fact that the one which we witnessed commenced in the middle   
   of September, and continued till the middle of the succeeding      
   January, during which time there was a constant succession of      
   ceremonies, not a day passing without one, while there were        
   sometimes as many as five or six within the twenty-four hours.     
   They were held at various hours, always one or more during the     
   daylight, and not infrequently one or two during the night, a      
   favourite time being just before sunrise. p. 272

The chapter discusses details concerning the sending out of 
messengers, preparing the ground and the set up, the particular 
totemic nature of some performances, the ten evening long opening of 
the event, and the equally long succeeding occurrence following which 
the young men are completely separated from the women. Their time is 
spent hunting and observing or joining in performances.

   On occasions such as this every man carries about with him a small 
   wallet which contains the few odds and ends needed for decoration  
   in the performance of the various ceremonies. The wallet consists  
   of a piece of the skin of some animal, such as one of the smaller  
   marsupials, with the fur left on, or else some flat strips of a    
   flexible bark tied round with fur string are used. In one of these 
   wallets will be found a tuft or two of eagle-hawk and emu          
   feathers, bunches of the tail feathers of the black cockatoo, some 
   porcupine-grass resin, pieces of red and yellow ochre and white    
   pipe-clay, an odd flint or two, balls of human hair and opossum    
   fur string, a tuft or two of the tail tips of the rabbit-kangaroo, 
   and not least, a dried crop of the eagle-hawk filled with down.    
   p. 283

There is adorning of a sacred pole which includes the use of human 
blood while a repetitive chant is uttered. There is adorning of 
performers. There are examinations of churinga conducted with utmost 
reverence, no one speaking above a whisper. After providing an 
account (concerning the travels and doings of two Alcheringa men) 
conveyed at one performance, the authors write:

   The importance of the traditions relating to the wanderings of the 
   Alcheringa ancestors has already been pointed out in connection    
   with the discussion of the totems. It must be remembered that it is 
   during the Engwura ceremony especially that a knowledge of these   
   matters is imparted by the elder to the younger men, on whose      
   memory the traditions are firmly fixed by means, to a large        
   extent, of the ceremonies, each of which is associated with some   
   special spot and some special individual or group. pp. 310-311

Among these accounts is reference to the salt water up north. Also, 
the ancestors are shown eating the totemic food, something generally 
not doneat present.

At one point each young man is assigned to one of the older men, who 
may have several such under him. They need his consent before 
speaking in his presence. The young men hunt, providing meat for 
older men who are concentrating on ceremonies. The young men eat only 
when and what their elders approve. 

Fire is significant. The young men move towards the women who hurl 
burning boughs and grass at them. On another occasion the young men 
hurl firesticks over the heads of the women.
 
   hundreds of them whizzed like rockets through the darkness; the    
   loud shouting of the men, the screaming of the women and children, 
   and the howling of scores of dogs produced a scene of              
   indescribable confusion.   p. 365

Another time the women light fires shouting that with them they will 
burn the men. The older men lead the younger ones to the fires, one 
for each of the two moieties of the tribe. The fires,

   were now giving off dense volumes of smoke from the green bushes   
   which had been placed on the red-hot embers. p. 380

Each man knelt on the appropriate fire while the women pressed hands 
onhis shoulders.

   In this way the performance was rapidly gone through, not a word   
   being spoken when once the ceremony had begun, each man simply     
   kneeling down in the smoke for at most half a minute. In less than 
   half an hour all was over... p. 380

The young men would remain in the bush until the lifting of the ban 
of silence. That includes presenting the older men with food and 
sprinkling them with blood. The authors were impressed at the 
readiness to open veins on this and other occasions to no apparent 
ill effect. 
 
Chapters X and XI (pp. 387-449) concern traditions of Alcheringa 
ancestors.

   In reality the traditions of the tribe recognise four more or less 
   distinct periods in the Alcheringa. During the first of these men  
   and women were created; in the second the rite of circumcision by  
   means of a stone knife, in place of a fire-stick, was introduced;  
   in the third the rite of Ariltha or sub-incision was introduced,   
   and in the fourth the present organization and marriage system of  
   the tribe were established. pp. 387-388

Firstly, two self-existing ones came from the Western Sky cutting 
with great sharp knives rounded shapes by the salt water then here 
into human form and with a firestick they performed circumcision. 
Little Hawk totem men continued to cut round shapes into humans. Some 
males remained uncircumcised.

Among the details of individuals named, places visited and what 
transpired are the assertions that the Little Hawk totem originated 
circumcision with stone knives, that sub-incision began in the Wild 
Cat totem, and that the Emu totem was the source of the present 
marriage system.

   The Udnirringita people of this, their central group, did not      
   wander about, and they are not recorded as having had any          
   Inapertwa ancestors, but the grubs are supposed to have been       
   transformed directly into human beings. Whilst, however, those who 
   originated at the Emily Gap, according to tradition, remained      
   there, other groups are recorded as having immigrated to the same  
   spot from outside parts of the country.  p. 428

   Every prominent and many insignificant natural features throughout 
   this strip of country -- the most picturesque part of the great    
   central area of the continent -- has some history attached to it.  
   For example, a gaunt old gum tree, with a large projecting bole    
   about the middle of the trunk, indicates the exact spot where an   
   Alcheringa man, who was very full of eggs, arose when he was       
   transformed out of a witchetty grub.  p. 424

There are details concerning immigrating Witchetty Grub people and of 
people of some other totems, of some adopting the Arunta language, an 
origin myth for a red ochre deposit and other myths.

Chapter Twelve (pp. 450-475) outlines various customs such as the 
knocking out of teeth prevalent in the rain country north-east of the 
Arunta. Most members of the Rain or Water totem perform this.

   the non-observance of the custom would not prevent any man from    
   being admitted to the secrets of the tribe, but it would subject   
   him to what is most dreaded by the native, and that is the         
   constant ridicule of the other men and women, with whom he is in   
   daily contact. p. 451

Although practised among males and females in central tribes, it is 
not the initiation rite that it is in eastern and southeastern 
Australia.

Next comes nose boring, then promoting breast growth:

   her body is rubbed all over with fat by the Gammona men, who then  
   paint a series of straight lines of red ochre down her back and    
   also down the centre of her chest and stomach. A wide circle is    
   painted round each nipple and straight lines below each of these   
   circles. Long strings of opossum fur-string are passed across each 
   shoulder and under each arm-pit; numbers of neck-rings are put     
   round her neck, several head-rings are placed on her forehead, and 
   a number of tail tips are fixed so that they droop down over the   
   forehead and ears. All these things have been charmed by the       
   Gammona men... p. 460

Gammona are uncles on the mother's side. Now come customs connected 
with blood and hair, with childbirth, with diet (largely providing 
food to in-laws and the needy, avoiding one's totem and foods 
prohibited to the uncircumcised boy).

Chapter XIII (pp. 476-496) concerns vengence. All deaths are avenged, 
the medicine man (whether so informed by the dying person or not) 
determines who by magic is responsible for the death and that person 
is killed. The executioner, one of his little toes having been 
dislocated, dons special shoes of emu feathers matted with blood. 
There are variations in the procedure of execution. Sometimes a 
medicine man performs magic, rubbing a substance into the wound. 
Sometimes a woman without the shoes but with other adornment smashes 
a churinga ("Specially made for the occasion by her husband" p. 486) 
into the back of a culprit's neck. Sometimes a group of avengers 
travel after the guilty.

Chapter XIV, "Customs Related to Burial and Mourning" (pp. 497-511), 
begins:

   Within a very short time of death the body in the Arunta tribe is  
   buried. It is placed in a sitting position with the knees doubled  
   up against the chin, and is thus interred in a round hole in the   
   ground, the earth being piled directly on to the body so as to     
   make a low mound with a depression on one side. This is always     
   made on the side which faces towards the direction of the dead man 
   or woman's camping ground in the Alcheringa...p. 497

There is mention of the safeguarding of male hair and ornaments, of 
the burning of the camp, of avoiding mention of the deceased's name 
for twelve or eighteen months, of avoiding the grave for some time, 
of the widow smearing herself with white pipe clay, of the periods of 
silence for widows in the Warramunga and the gesture language there.

   Not seldom, when a party of women are in camp, there will be       
   almost perfect silence and yet a brisk conversation is all the     
   while being conducted on their fingers or rather with their hands  
   and arms, as many of the signs are made by putting the hands, or   
   perhaps the elbows, in varying positions. Many of the positions    
   assumed by the fingers are such that it is not at all easy for a   
   white man to imitate them...  p. 500-501

There are mourning ceremonies a year or so after death at which 
enormous displays of grief may be evident.

Chapter XV (pp. 512-521) concerns spirits. The reincarnation of an 
Alcheringa spirit into a human of the present generation provides the 
opportunity for the unreincarnated aspect of the spirit, the double, 
if you will, to watch over the human. There are such doubles, as well 
as Alcheringa spirits not currently reincarnated often beneficial, 
though evil influence, especially to wanderers in the night, is a 
very real Aboriginal fear.

Chapter XVI (pp. 522-553) concerns medicine men and magic. Ordinary 
spirits, mischievious spirits and medicine men produce medicine men. 
One sign of the profession is the hole in the tongue:

   The tongue remains throughout life perforated in the centre with a 
   hole large enough to admit the little finger. p. 523

The medicine man sees spirits, as do dogs. After waiting a year, if 
his tongue has not closed up, he may practise, using the magic stones 
the spirits placed in his body to cure others.

   He may not for instance eat fat or warm meat, neither must he      
   inhale the smoke from burning bones, nor go near to the nest of    
   the large "bull-dog" ant (a species of Myrmecia), because if he    
   were bitten by one of these he would lose his powers for ever.     
   p. 525

Though there are not many, there are some medicine women. Among the 
requirements of one initiated a medicine man is a month of 
abstemption. This includes avoiding intercourse with his wife.

   In ordinary cases the patient lies down on the ground while the    
   medicine man bends over and sucks vigorously at the affected part  
   of the body, spitting out every now and then supposed pieces of    
   wood, bone or stone, the presence of which is believed to be       
   causing the injury and pain. p. 531

Medicine men determine culpability for deaths. It is believed some 
among other tribes change into hawks. There is detail about magic 
which may be done by anyone. Much of this concerns causing harm. 
Then, there are pages concerning charming women, who must be among 
those one is allowed to marry for this to be accepted. However,

   Just as we find magic used in connection with the securing of a    
   wife who is already the property of another man, so we find also a 
   special form of magic employed in the punishment of the individual 
   who is guilty of the theft. p. 548

Chapter XVII (pp. 554-560) considers non-magical means of obtaining 
wives: capture (rare), elopement and, most common, arrangement with 
the father.

Chapter XVIII (pp. 561-566) concerns beliefs about celestial objects. 
There are myths about the sun (female) and moon (male). An evil 
spirit, Arungquiltha, is thought to cause eclipses of the sun.    
   
   Mushrooms and toadstools they will not eat, believing them to be   
   fallen stars and endowed with Arungquiltha. p. 566

Chapter XIX, "Clothing, Weapons, Implements, Decorative Art" (pp. 
567-635) begins by stating that the people of Central Australia are 
the most artistic on the continent, that normally their superb 
workmanship of tools and weapons is not much adorned and:

   The most striking feature with regard to decoration amongst the    
   Central natives is the constant and plentiful use of red ochre and 
   grease. It may perhaps be that this is due to the fact that for    
   ages past the native has been accustomed to regularly rub this     
   material over his most sacred objects, the Churinga, which are     
   stored in hiding places amongst the rocks, and this again may be   
   associated with the fact that they are thereby protected to a      
   certain extent from the ravages of insects such as the white ant.  
   p. 568

Natives do not wear clothes, though they adorn themselves with 
necklets, armlets, forehead bands, the waste-band, etc. There are 
also tailtips women wear over the ears.

   The most characteristic weapons of the native are spears,          
   spear-throwers, shields and boomerangs, all of which he habitually 
   carries about with him when on the march... p. 574

Next come details about weapons, music (banging weapons on the ground 
or against each other, two pieces of wood imitating a frog's croak, a 
trumpet, etc.) wooden containers for food and drink, spindles, rock 
paintings (geometric and zoomorphic), festive decoration (head-dress, 
bird's down, designs, etc.).

There follow appendices concerning native names:

   Every man has thus: (1) his sub-class name, (2) his totem name,    
   (3) his personal name, (4) his secret or Churinga name, (5)        
   probably a nick-name, (6) his status term, and (7) he may have, if 
   he has acted    as an official during an initiation ceremony, a    
   special term applied to by the man who was initiated at that       
   ceremony. p. 638

a comparison of South and Central Australian ceremonies, and detailed 
measurements of thirty individuals. There is also a glossary of 
Aboriginal terms (pp. 645-657), an index (pp. 659-669) and a fold out 
map. 

This is a thoroughly fascinating account, highly recommended.
