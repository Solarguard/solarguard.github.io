<H3>Correspondences for Enochian Chess Divination</H3>

Michael McKenny, no date.<p>

Here are brief correspondences for Enochian chess divination.  The major pieces are provided elemental attributions and the squares of the boards Hebrew letters. There are Qabalistic lists of correspondences which can provide one with all kinds of connections once one has the Hebrew letter. However, as in manuals interpreting the symbols of dreams, one does well to balance details of the archetype with one's individual experience and feeling for such aspects of the unconscious.<p>

A. PIECES: <p>

<pre>
   King   = Spirit of its element  Tarot Ace of its element
   Knight = Fire of its element    Tarot Knight     "
   Queen  = Water of its element   Tarot Queen      "
   Bishop = Air of its element     Tarot Prince     "
   Rook   = Earth of its element   Tarot Princess   "
</pre>

<p>Each pawn is considered the vice-gerent of the major piece. Pieces and pawns have all been attributed correspondences in the ancient Egyptian pantheon. 

<p>The Queen of Fire would be Water of Fire etc.

<p>1. DETERMINATION OF THE PTAH SQUARE

<p>Once one has decided which elemental board and angle most correspond to the question, then one determines the precise square on that angle according to the astrological House into which the question best fits. The above letters may be attributed astrological correspondences. One will note that each angle contains 16 squares. 4 of these are elemental squares (A = Air, M = Water, Sh = Fire, Th = Earth) and the other twelve the astrological Houses.

<p>The correspondences of Sign = House = Letter are: 

<pre>
     Sign        House      Letter

     Airies       = 1 =       H
     Taurus       = 2 =       V
     Gemini       = 3 =       Z
     Cancer       = 4 =       Ch
     Leo          = 5 =       T
     Virgo        = 6 =       I
     Libra        = 7 =       L
     Scorpio      = 8 =       N
     Sagittarius  = 9 =       S
     Capricorn   = 10 =       O
     Aquarius    = 11 =       Tz
     Pisces      = 12 =       Q

</pre>

<p>I think this is enough for now.
