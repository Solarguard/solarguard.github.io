Twenty Stanzas on the Ogham

Eyes up!
Feet on the floor!
You hear the birds outside.
Let's get the pails to milk the cows.
There's grass and dew.
Dawn's here.

Let's look!
Let's ask the wind!
An ear upon the ground.
What's sounding near? What smells? What's bright?
With nose and toes
Let's see.

Let's walk.
Let's step ahead.
Let's march behind our shields.
Let's row our boat, although it storms.
We're safe today.
Advance.

Ebb flow,
A skipping girl,
Let's see a dream awake.
Pictures are leaping from the well.
Inside the mind.
Let's feel.

Let's reach
Above the roof,
A bridge beyond the world,
A key to soar towards the gods.
Let's use our wings.
Let's fly.

Let's rest.
Let's pause and heal.
This here's a place of peace.
Let's take a breath, relax our arms.
Let's sip a drink.
Time out.

A lord,
A leader fair,
A host who greets and feeds,
A hawk in war, an owl in peace,
A guy who's great,
A chief.

Let's weigh
With honest scales.
Let's pay a debt that's owed.
Let's ride the road, avoid the ditch.
Let's eat our greens.
Balance.

Let's make.
Let's move the brush.
Let's sing a newer song.
Transform hard stone to human face.
It's time for crafts.
Inspired.

A laugh,
A smiling face,
An apple red on tree,
A girl, a boy, a leap for joy.
It's time for fun.
Happy.

A vine
That grows along,
That joins the past today
With what's to come, a garmont sewn.
They're holding hands.
A weave.

A drum.
Hoofbeats behind.
To dash ahead or turn
With sword to fight or words of peace,
Deciding time,
Warning.

A broom.
Let's sweep and wash.
Let's water dirt and toss
What's yucky, stinky, smelly, bad.
Let's tidy up.
Let's clean.

It's fall
And drop the leaves,
A thing we cannot change.
The trees undress for snowy sleep.
It has to be.
It's fate.

A wheel.
The time returns.
A seed, a tree, a seed.
A baby walks with cane to grave
To crawl again.
It's life.

Let's look.
Let's see afar.
With finger hole to eye. (see note below)
Let's think about the kids to be
And future good
perceive.

Let's seek.
Let's meet a guide.
A bee can smell the way.
Let's reach the books, the tools we need.
Let's know to look.
Let's find.

Let's hug.
Let's smile a while.
Enjoy the sound of harps.
Let's sail inside the tales they bring.
Let's feel happy.
Let's dream.

Hurray!
The race is won!
The first across the line
Receives the gold, the garland sweet,
The victor's song
And cheers.

A bird.
A living Yew
That grows among the stones,
A breath of life that flies afar.
Ever alive.
A soul.

Note: The people of the North above the tree line, where often the
horizon is the only limit to sight, look through a little hole formed
by the thumb and the two fingers closest to the thumb in order to see
more clearly what's far away.
