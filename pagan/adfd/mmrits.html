Rituals Attended

I'm not sure of the requirement here. Is it all rituals or only
those attended during the five months covered by journal entries?
I have not found a separate file here and this, too, I retype from
the journal. In order to meet any extensive requirement, I am also
composing what I can for rituals not described in the volume of the
journal I found. There is a requirement for a description of the
taking of the dedicants oath. This was done in front of the grove at
our equinox ritual in September 2000. The description from the
journal of that is in a separate file mmoath.txt. These journal
entries may be identical to what was sent three years ago. This
includes the Ottawa Pagan Network Ritual on March 20, 1999 as this
was conducted by the Silver Fox (Montreal) ADF Grove, our pre-grove
ritual at the Tree Ring at Bealtaine 1999 (four of the six people
there are currently ADF members, our formal founding ritual at
Midsummer 1999 and our Lughnasad 1999 Rit at the Kalaidescope Fest.

20/3/99
   It is about 23:30. I've just returned from the Ritual. This was
my first ADF Ritual. I really resonated to many aspects of it: down
the well to invite the ancestors, up to the gods and goddesses,
acknowledging and inviting the nature spirits all around, the
meditation where we became aware of ourselves as trees, roots, etc.
and then became aware of the other trees around us and our
interlocking branches, the very Irish thing of being conscious of
and singing the song to the local river goddess, the concept of
offering those who don't belong a gift, a drink, to stay away, and
those who don't belong and won't accept a gift to stay away are then
told to stay away beyond the light. Near the beginning we had been
blessed by earth, water and sky rubbing a bit of earth on the
forehead, sprinkling a bit of water and wafting a bit of smoke. Now
ther is the invocation from Bridget, herself earlier invited
specially and offered a drink as a gift, of the favours we need in
the spring. We are asked if we accept her gifts and said yes and
touched a cloth special to the Silver Fox Grove in Montreal. Also,
the divination discloses that travel, victory and change are our
future. This we accept and drink water that is offered around. We
sing together. The gates are closed. The informal chatting,
drinking of mead, etc. begins.
   I felt energy during the formal ritual and I very much resonated
to many aspects of this. During the informal part I met many new
people from Montreal and Ottawa.

30/4/99
It is 22:15. I have just returned home from the Beltane gathering at
the Tree Ring. When I arrived I saw four other people: Ian and
Frances, Lee and Meredith. After chatting briefly we began the more
solemn, if that's the word, aspect. There was sweet grass I believe
it was that Merdedith brought to each of the others. Then we circled
the trees and entered inside. Then was a quiet time with some soft
drumming. I read a little thing in Irish which I had written
expecially for this occasion. It goes: "Onoraid Deithe sruthana,
sinsearagh, tailimh, Bile, fainne crann. Is e n'oiche Bealtaine e.
Ta athas oraing. Mhainn an rince seasur gan cheann." I've no idea
how many mistakes there are in it. The important thing in my opinion
is that it was in Irish, that there was Irish spoken on this
occasion. The quality of the Irish can grow. First the seed, then
the shoot and later the grown tree.
   There was a lot of good feeling, of sharing of good vibes as we
explained it to a sixth guy, a non-pagan environmental activist from
northern New York who'd come up with his twin brother Don (he was
Dave) to do a dance circle and read poetry. He read a few poems.
   It was the first time I'd been with others like that at the Tree
Ring on such an occasion. There was the giving of rose petals, a
symbol of love for Beltane, and sprinkling them around the group.
There was a candle at the beginning. There were neat little noise
makers or whatever like the five wooded spools of thread on a wooden
pole, the tree rainmaker or whatever it's called, the moon goddess,
etc.
   We chatted. We sang, "We are a circle within a circle," etc. We,
"scratched the tree under the ears" to quote Ian. It was great.

20/6/99 c. 17:10
   I returned not long ago from the Midsummer Rit of ADF. It may be
considered the founding rit of ADF-Ottawa. It was great. There were
some sixteen people there, including several who came from Montreal,
Heather (Puck) a new Ottawa ADF member (she just sent in her
membership this past week) and our scribe was there, but Ian, John
Seargent and Lee Murray were not there. There was Charlie, the
father from Montreal down to see his teenage son Brian. There was
Michael from Picton who had found a staff gnawed by beavers on Lake
Ontario. There was Collin and Elizabeth, etc.
   I was surprised that we did not form a circle around the Tree
Ring, but off to one side. It was Nordic in focus and Thor was
mentioned as one of three main deities. It rained, but not enough to
come through the leaves. Sheila was surprised to see me come in the
door afterwards dry and asked about that.
   There was a chant we sang on the procession at the beginning that
I really liked. It goes:
   "We are walking to the grove.
   We are on the path we chose.
   We will never lose our way.
   Cause we dream all night and travel by day."
   Right after the rit I asked Linda if she could tell me the words.
She did even better and sold me her BIG BARDIC BOOK which contains
this and the lyrics of 220 other chants she has collected from 1988-
1999. Great.
   The runes were cast by Michael Demers, our chief druid. There
were three very favourable ones. I believe the first was Sun. I'll
have to send him an e-mail request for the full text of his
divination, as this ought not be forgotten in the future of our
grove.

1/8/99
   I went to the ADF Lugnasad Rit at Kalaidescope at the site on the
Ontario Mississippi River past Sharbot Lake. This is about an hour
and a half ride from here, so three hours yesterday were spent in
the car.
   MJ from Nova Scotia and Cathbad, the one who runs the Nemeton
list, were at our rit. The outstanding events and features of this
rit were the breaking of the whole bottle of mead (as our senior
druid tried to get the cork out) which was acknowledged when Ian
poured a bit of Irish whiskey as libation saying, "And the whole
bottle of mead you grabbed earlier," the saying of a story and oath
and a boast as the goblet passed around three times (mine were a) "I
was proclaimed a heretic and replied, 'No, I am a pagan.'" b)
conabor, "I'll try" and c) "And next Lughnasad I'll speak better
Irish than my ancestors did), the invoking of two deities such as
Lugh and Medbh somewhat confrontational towards each other (at one
point as Ian calling Medbh is continuing, Puck calling Lugh says,
"Enough!"), the significant rainfall and the drawing of the ogham
omens by Puck (Heather):
For Medbh Heather, Aspen, Apple
For Lugh Vine, Hawthorn, Straiph (Blackthorn).
   Another main event for me was that Puck loaned me her copy of
Edred Thorsson's THE BOOK OF OGHAM. I have been reading it with keen
interst. I had gone there with my ogham few onn in the hopes it
would enable me to gather knowledge needed.

The September 1999 Rit was the one performed as a Greek play. Ian
Clysdale wrote it and it concerns the descent of Persephone into the
Underworld. The characters of this play, the participants of the
ritual read their parts, are some of the Greek deities: Demeter,
Hermes, Athena, etc. Although I am a Celt and was not really used to
so dramatic a ritual, Ian still pulled it off as far as I am
concerned and it worked for me.

The Samhain 1999 Ritual was very special. I believe I wrote this one
and it was likely the first one I wrote. As part of Samhain it had
in it burning messages that were intended for the ancestors. We did
this one at the home of our senior druid, Michael Demers, and he had
a fire pit. One of the special aspects of the ritual was that for
some of this one, the outside portion, there was a film crew from
the journalism class at Carleton University, about half a dozen, if
I recall correctly, but despite the presence of these observers, we
were able to focus alright. More impressive, when we moved from the
outside into the house, leaving the film crew outside, as part of
that symbolic crossing the threshold on this special day, and Karen
led us in guided meditation, that was a potent meditation. I think
we all spoke of its effectiveness and I recall that as the best such
up until that period. Feasting and fellowship afterwards. It was a
very good ritual.

Yule 1999 was one I did not attend, but I wrote it as a Norse Rit.
Yule feels Norse to me and our senior druid of the time was Norse.
I don't think this one is on the website, but I believe I took
largely the same ritual for Yule 2000 and that one is on the web
page. What I missed in 1999 and attended in 2000 was one of our two
all night vigils for the longest night. This is an influence of the
Silver Fox Grove. In 2000 we did a bit at the Tree Ring at sunset,
came here (since I live close to the Tree Ring) and then proceeded
to Frances' place where the bulk of the vigil took place. This was
very impressive, perhaps the most astonishing thing for me, one who
tends to rise at dawn and go to sleep in synch to that, was in the
midst of an alert and keen consultation on the future of the grove
realizing it was something like 3 AM.

Imbolc 2000 was one at Ian's place. He did this with reference to
the four provinces of Ireland. I spoke for Ulster. Each of the
provinces had its characteristic: Munster as the place generally
first touched by visitors and immigrants was hospitality. Leinster
was fertility of crops and herds, Connacht was teaching and druids
and Ulster was struggle. Since my ancestors are supposed to come
from Monaghan, Monaghan, I identify with the North and Ulster,
though I'm not keen on senseless struggle. This ritual worked both
in the sense of the resonance of the theme of the Provinces of
Ireland and in me being energized at work the next day, despite the
shortness of sleep.

Ostara and Bealtaine 2000.
I can't recall clearly, but my work schedule had me miss two rituals
and I think these could have been Ostara and Bealtaine 2000.

Midsummer 2000. This was a celebration of our first anniversary as a
grove. It was done in the four provinces of Ireland mode which has a
certain resonance for me. In general in the conducting of rituals I
find I most resonate with doing the ancestors. I have also done
ogham divination. Runes more recently, only in 2003.

Lughnasad 2000. We gathered at the Tree Ring. We recalled the
anniversary of being at fest for this one. There was the tale, oath
and boast thing. Someone spoke of where we would be in a year from
now, and for my boast I spoke of doing my best even were i on
another planet.

The deepening program was sent before the Equinox. At the equinox
ritual, before the assembled grove, we (Puck and I) took our
dedicants oath. This is in a separate file, mmoath.txt
