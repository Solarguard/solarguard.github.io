An Introduction to Fragrant Garden,  

Fragrant Garden is the proposed name of the human homeworld. It is
an indication of the vast potential of the human species. This is
something very different from perfect utopia. Simply ending the Cold
War released such energy that populations depressed for a generation
awoke to a sense of almost limitless possibilities.

That point in human history bears intent scrutiny, especially in
consideration of the means and methodology whereby the benefits
bestowed on humanity were transmuted. How did it happen that once
again the species slipped into contentious conflict and attitudes
accepting the division of this world into warring camps?

Fragrant Garden will consider not just some specific conservative
program to perpetuate the American military-industrial complex, so
apprehensively drawn to the attention of the American people by
President Eisenhower. Nor will it look only at the continued hold
by fundamentalist clerics of all faiths on their co-religionists.

These are specific features of something that requires a general and
more inclusive analysis. Of course, there are such fundamentalists
clinging to a particular literalist priority of scriptural passages
enabling conflict. There are also those with vested interests in
maintaining the above mentioned military-industrial complex. There
are others very much determined to increase specific company influences,
even at the cost of wars.

It has been said that such aspects of modern life as the expensive
cancer deaths benefit both the manufacturers of cigarettes and those
producing the highly lucrative pharmaceuticals absorbing such a high
percentage of health expenditures. Thus, enormous resistance to real
beneficial change exists.

Fragrant Garden is primarily concerned with fundamental causes of
such considerable disregard of the public good. What is it about the
human animal that propels individuals of the species to assess
individual advantages in terms contrary to the wellbeing of the
species?

A close examination at the physical structure of the human brain,
taking into account the other animals resident on this planet, would
seem to suggest inclinations to self acquisition, to interpersonal
conflict, to tribal identification predate humanity. Forerunners of
humans, predecessor species have bequeathed physical neuronal ways
permitting such anti-social attitudes and behaviours.

Humans also have inherited and can learn lessons more advantageous
than the training generations have had in religious and economic
intolerance. It is worthy of note that often the more destructively
oriented, intent at any cost to exercise influence, are able to find
their way (by hook or by crook) into powerful offices. History has
provided numerous examples of this situation.

Fragrant Garden is both a basic consideration of the hard wiring and
the education going into species destructive beliefs and patterns of
behaviour and an analysis of the means whereby humanity may remedy
these defects. First, comes the recognition that propaganda inciting
competition is contrary to human communal interest. Then comes focus
on the interest of humanity.

Fragrant Garden examines honestly the extent to which humans are
preprogrammed by genetics, programmed by education systems and by
the advertising campaigns of those with vested interests in ongoing
contention, in continuing deficient medical practices, etc. Fragrant
Garden indicates some human responsibility to attain the harmony of
the species and then to safeguard it from throwbacks.

Also, there remains the vast potential of an intelligent species,
acting for its own good, utilizing fully its people resources, its
population healthy, peaceful, prosperous, energized within a growing
civilizaion.

In my opinion, such a species would collectively rejoice in its
African heritage and honour the sacred home continent of all. With
this understanding, it seems very reasonable to locate the capital
of the planet close to where humans are thought to have evolved. 
Thus, Nairobi may more befittingly host the UN headquarters. This 
suggestion is in keeping with a spirit of honouring the ancestors 
of all humans. In a worldview that focuses on co-operation, insight,
goodwill and understanding, such could easily, harmoniously occur.

Fragrant Garden envisages the human species increasing arable land
and enhancing moderate weather throughout much of Africa and much of
other areas at present close to uninhabitable. Fragrant Garden is a
planet within a solar system. Naturally, once it is in basic harmony
humans will be drawn throughout that solar system. Essential science
enabling quicker movement throughout that volume of space, shielding
from cosmic rays and larger objects, addressing the psychological
interaction of people in small groups, etc. is a prerequisite for
such human exploration.<p> 

This has been only an introduction of the concept of Fragrant Garden
as examining the human condition, past, present and future. In time
to come, further thoughts, more precise details may be included. In
keeping with the spirit of human potential, I'll add that ideally
the completed book will be composed in the Chinese language. China
for milennia has been the most literate human society. A truly
global human civilization may very well include much of benefit from
China.

All the Best,
