QUANDO IN TERRA

When will the process of development of the nations of the earth
reach the stage where there will be one sovereign state, one human
country, one globally perceived homeland for the human species?

Historians, scholars, students, pupils, populations study and absorb
through their popular cultures the stories, the myths, the factual
unfoldment of the growth of their various nation states. Vested and
special interests, powerful restraining forces, sectarian and
localized identifications, personal egos and ambitions, the agendas
of businesses and corporations, military might, a host of impediments
to national emergence were transformed in these historical processes.

The same impediments are adduced as the realities negating allegedly
the logical growth of a human nation state. It is to be expected
that future dwellers of the Motherland of humanity will read the no
less thrilling account of the transformation of these impediments as
the previous populations of the various sectors of the planet have
read, studied and heard in the accounts of the birth of their lands.
The degree of tragedy and violence in the continuing history of the
attainment by the human species of its homeland is something now
largely under the control of the peoples of the planet Earth.

Each generation is met by the assertions from those whose personal
interest resides in maintaining inequality, dominance, control, that
reality dictates the preservation of unacceptable conditions. Each
generation is confronted by the fact of its voluntary exercise of
free will, its ability to choose to be complicit in unacceptable
conditions continuing or to select the option of enhancing the
quality of life for all the fellow citizens of the Terran homeland.
Advertising agencies, political campaigns and the entire industry of
mass entertainment are founded on the notion that by and large the
individuals composing the human species are marks that can be conned
into buying a particular product, dupes that can be sold a political
bill of goods, cows that can be lazed into grazing on shows and on
circuses.

This entertainment includes the presentation of current global
events in many lands, including in the USA, where the distortion of
what is happening from "The whole truth and nothing but the truth,"
could hardly be greater.

The prophecy of what is going to happen has always been a very
problematic undertaking. However, it is very legitimate to point to
the similarities between today's circumstances and those faced by the
various nations that did in the end succeed in getting born in the
face of so many opposing obstacles. And it is quite reasonable to
state the anticipation that at some point in the future the human
species which learned how to produce agriculturalists, founded towns
and cities, developed trade routes and countries, gave birth to very
talented artists, trained crafts workers, schooled scientists,
engineers and doctors, etc. will heal itself of the diseases keeping
it divided, construct the modalities for its global life and learn
the ways and means of its harmonious existence into the future. It is
not an issue of some dreamy utopia, some Hollywood glazed inertia
based on suspension of disbelief, nor of a similar paralysis of will
founded on fearful nightmares of dystopia.

The historians, teachers, pupils, population studying, learning,
living the reality of human accomplishment will be very aware of the
facts of their civilization, their history, their daily life.

Today there is a conversation at some of the highest levels across
the continents that specifically Brazil, Germany, India and Japan be
accorded their deserved permanent seats on the Security Council of
the United Nations. As to be expected, those whose existing power
surpasses their real weight are very hesitant to agree to a more
equitable distribution of power. This particular debate, this renewed
focus of light on the unacceptable current circumstance of European
and American domination of the planet, is significant, although it is
one symptom of the greater problem, one aspect of anachronistic
behaviours, one stage in the growth of a human state.

Of course, the UN Security Council is in great need of enhancement.
Justly, the Security Council would represent the interests of the
important segments of the human species. That the traditional
impediments to equitable arrangements oppose such arrangements does
not prevent the enunciation of more equitable arrangements. It is
very clear that the most equitable arrangement would be for the UN
to be governed as a Parliament or Congress with the election of
delegates based on proportional representation with guarantees for
the rights of minorities, and that no superiority ought to be held
by any district, especially on such grounds as previously or at
present such a place was imposing its will on others by force of
arms!

Having stated the ideal goal of doing away with the preference of
some places over others, so long as there remain veto wielding seats
on the Security Council, then it is more ethical that these be
temporary and accorded on some such basis as one per continent, with
perhaps two for Asia which has such a vast area and population.

If even this is discounted by the current impediments to the growth
of human civilization, strictly within the context of anachronistic
present structures, then, of course, Brazil, Germany, India and Japan
deserve to be brought on board. However, no one should ever forget
that this has been a settling for something very far from what is
possible.

Just because the Solar Guard pointed to the current stage of human
history as a replay at the global level of the Chinese Period of the
Warring States and even calculated the length of time of that ancient
period is no excuse, especially in times of modern destructive
technologies, for an equal number of generations to feel exempted
from the responsibility to exercise their capacity to do better than
fight among themselves until some land's leadership acquires control
of the planet. Such control may well have been much easier to achieve
in an age of swords and spears than with modern weaponry. As well,
the short lived duration of the victor of the Warring States Period
one hopes can serve as a splendid cautionary tale ensuring all on
Earth today try a more co-operative approach and restrain themselves
from temptations for use of heedless militaristic might.

The opportunity to view the planet as a homeworld of the human
species, to seek to contribute beneficially to the emergence of a
worthwhile, truly representative and humane global nation, to
resist baser inclinations to dominate other lands and peoples, to
say nothing of the populations of one's own country, continues to
exist throughout the historical stage of the birth of the nation of
humanity.

May all those finding themselves now in positions of authority, power
and influence, as well as all humans, who, notwithstanding the belief
systems of Madison Avenue and of Hollywood, do possess free will and
are capable of becoming conscious of their fundamental humanity, be
inspired to assert themselves as contributors, rather than obstacles,
to the achievement of sovereignty for the human homeland.

Very Best Wishes, Michael McKenny, September 22, 2004
