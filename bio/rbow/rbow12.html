Chapter Twelve Flight

"I'm okay," she assured us barely a microsecond later. "However,
it's an amazingly powerful magic user we're dealing with."

"I'm going to let them know back home," I projected.

"Agreed," projected Blue and Orange together.

I reached down deep into the psychic level required. For a short
instant I felt suffused by relaxed calm, surrounded by a sea of
serenity. Then I called forth the image of Indigo. I saw this take
shape behind my eyelids. There was her glade in the great woods.
There was her tower rising from a well. There was that ordinary
looking knoll where she loved to sit and stare up at the starry sky
at night or in daylight across to the sea of trees. Here she sat
now, a flitterfly on the shoulder of her robe of colour, a scamperer
at her feet. One of her hands was rubbing an indigo crystal and the
other was wrapped around a walking stick which stood by her side.
She was the oldest of us all and the one who had travelled furthest
along the mystic path.

"Indigo," I called softly, and she heard me.

"Green," she projected, "what's wrong?"

"Please, prepare to receive an important transmission. Kindly
forward it to the others. Sorry, I can't stay and chat. Things are
happening."

"You may send your message," she projected.

The mental record of all that had happened since Orange had
telepathically informed Blue and I that he had detected something
was beamed in a single tight telepathic pulse.

"You have successfully sent your message," she projected, and I
could feel her beginning to analyze the information she'd just
received.

"Farewell," I projected.

"Green, you be careful," came her fading thought as the knoll and
the grass and her ethereal tower behind her vanished from before my
psychic vision.

I felt relieved. Now our fellow wizards and through them the rest of
the civilized galaxy would be alerted if anything untoward happened
to us. I drove that thought out of my mind. Not only did such
thoughts open up a path by which our adversaries could discover us,
they also opened up a path by means of which we could be defeated.
Thoughts are things and while we certainly knew how to be careful,
I, we, would only visualize success.

"Even though it's just a tiny black fly?" Orange was asking. "Where
does it hide it's brain capacity?"

"Size doesn't have to mean anything," Blue replied. "Don't forget
the size and capacity of the computer chip."

"That works even with magic?" he asked.

"Well, Terran mythology seems to back our own in describing the
Little People as great magic users," Blue replied.

"Green," came Kevin's voice. I could read that he was just starting
to get concerned as I had not replied to something, and seemed to be
staring out into space. The transmission to Indigo had taken my
complete concentration.

"Yes, though our grampa gowa and their elves and leprechauns are
only mythological beings," projected Blue.

"I feel," projected Orange, "that there's an enormous difference
between a leprechaun and a black fly. Don't you agree?"

"I'm starting to fear," I projected, "that the only difference in
this case may be ethics, morality, what Terran gamers call
alignment."

"That's not yet confirmed," projected Orange. "It may turn out that
our recent experiences have us leaping to erroneous conclusions."

"Ay-yar grant that you're right," projected Blue.

"Our field's starting to weaken," I projected. "That thing seems to
be causing an enormous drain on our energy."

"Confirmed," projected Orange. "It's dropped nine point four per
cent. Pulling in reserves."

Blue and I joined him in drawing energy from our matrix rings to
sustain the strong psychic shields as well as the cloak concealing
our extra-terrestrial identity. However, considering the enormous
power of this thing, there was a good chance, we'd soon need all the
energy we had for even more important purposes.

"Sorry," I said to Kevin, getting unsteadily to my feet.

Even as this thought was passing through me mind and I was striving
to banish it as one too negative and defeatist, the black fly began
a startling transformation, an alarming change. It was not that it
decided to emulate the remarkable change of the catterpillar into
the butterfly. Nothing so normal and at the same time so miraculous
as that was its intent and soon accomplished purpose. Rather, in the
fraction of a second it took for us to draw that energy from our
rings and bring our shields and cloak back to full strength, this
insect that was closer to a reptile in nature, had assumed the size
of a small aircraft. One instant it was a tiny black fly. The next
it vaguely resembled a pterodactyl, or perhaps a dragon.

"That's some illusion," projected Orange.

"Negative," contradicted Blue. "It is not bothering to cast any
illusionary or hallucinatory spells. We're seeing it largely as it
is in this dimension."

"I don't like the impression we're getting of this thing's
strength," I projected.

"Isn't matter the same density in its crazy dimension?" asked
Orange. "Or was I in a black hole?"

"We had the briefest glimpse," Blue projected, "of the weird
reality this thing comes from. As far as I can tell, any distortion
of the normal laws of nature appears possible there."

"Is this Kaylooree?" asked Orange, naming the Lord of the Pit.

"I very much doubt it," replied Blue. "I do suspect, though, that we
may have here one of the most magically adept of his servants."

"Great," I projected. "Just what we need. I'm going to get ready to
join you, in the physical if needed." While we could do a lot in the
astral, being physically present would allow us to use our maximum
power.

"My head," I said. "I better step outside for a moment." I could
read that Kevin was quite alarmed.

We had been thinking these thoughts at our normal, near computer
swift pace. Yet, almost as fast as we could think, it acted. It
swung its great black head toward the space where Blue and Orange
thought their astral forms were concealed from psychic scrutiny. It
opened its great beak and the vibrations we detected in the air
indicated it was emitting a sound. It was a roar, though considering
the size of the beast, it was remarkably ineffective. It was almost
as if it thought that it was sufficient that it be heard and that
the volume didn't matter.

More serious, we now were picking up an unmistakable and intense
psychic odour. This confirmed, as I had feared, that more than the
colour of its scales was black.

It gazed straight at them and its eyes gleamed malefically. It swept
on its great wings right for them.

"So much for our cloaking spell," projected Orange.

Instantly, their astral bodies, dropped from their position several
metres above the trees, down into the woods. It entered the space,
where they had been, and hovered there glaring down at them.

"I know something is there," came a bizarre thought from its
ultradimensional mind at only forty one per cent of our standard
conversational telepathic velocity. "I know that there is
nourishment there. This is a nourishing world. I will feast, if not
on you now, then on you soon. I detect other food, lots of food
close by. I am off to feed. Think not that you are escaping me."

We felt it move its wings and head off in the direction of the city.

"Don't worry," I said. "I should be back soon. All the best."

"We can't just let it fly into Ottawa to feed," projected Orange.

"You're right," agreed Blue.

They both rose and began to follow it. Immediately, it sensed that
they were above the trees. It swirled. It charged at them as swift
as lightning. As it did so, it projected a confused visual,
something to do, it seemed, with eating. Its mouth passed through
the space they'd occupied barely a microsecond earlier. Again, they
had plunged below tree level, though not completely in time.

The two of them felt the searing tear of that more than merely
physical mouth through their mental and psychic forms. Even I,
merely sensing what they experienced, shuddered. Our shields and
cloak frayed and dropped temporarily. The shields flared into life
again. However, what was gone was the fiction that we were native to
this planet.

"Well, if we don't need that any more," projected Orange, "let's not
waste any more energy on it."

"Agreed," projected Blue. "It's time to get serious."

"I'll be there soon," I projected.

There would be no further hesitation in taking the final step in a
desperate situation.

There beneath the moon and above the pleasant trees hung an entity
from beyond this physical universe. It had already tried to take a
bite out of their astral forms. The other two wizards did not need
the few seconds I did to reach a door and step out into the night,
from which unseen they could project their physical forms to
confront the flying threat. Their action was instantaneous.

Their bodies no longer sat in a library, nor lay resting on a couch
in Ottawa while their astral selves roved the skies and struggled
with this ultramundane horror. Their physical forms joined their
psychic ones in the air above the trees. Nor were they concealed by
any spell of invisibility. Even beyond this, for the first time
since we'd arrived on this planet, disguise was completely cast
aside. They did not stand there arrayed in the jeans and t-shirt of
any ordinary young resident of Ottawa and most other cities on this
planet. They, who were clearly the Wizards of Blue and Orange, were
now physically present, attired in the cloaks and headbands of their
colours.

It hesitated in amazement at the extent of the magic might which so
suddenly had appeared to confront it.

And then I was beside them, dressed as a wizard is dressed among my
people. I wore a long plain green robe. An emerald green headband
kept my long hair out of my eyes. My face showed the lines and the
long beard more befitting one of my years.

My ring glimmered with the power of my life force and with the
spirits of all of my predecessors. I did not hang there merely
observing that which had so threatened us. I had come here for one
purpose and my two colleagues the same. We soared together through
the sky above these trees in the Gatineau Hills.

It's hesitation lasted another hundredth of a second. Then it shook
its massive head and sent forth a sound which it may have intended
as a scornful laugh.

"Good. I get to feed on you now," it projected.

However, we had not come to fool around. There was no need to
consult about which spell to use or whether an ordinary Enochian
envelope would adequately conceal our planet of origin.

At once, we shouted at the top of our voices, drawing on the
totality of our extrasensory ability, the six most potent psychic
syllables in the known galaxy. We spoke them in our own awesomely
ancient language, and with the same determination as when the very
first of our kind had utterd those six syllables in the greatest
magical confrontation from the dawn of our recorded history.

"Ay-yar ih Ay-yar nih!" we screamed as our rings sent forth three
enormous lightning bolts to sear the great black monstrosity from
the skies.

However, it was already gone. It had vanished even before its ears
could receive the sound of our shouted six syllables. It had
disappeared even before our three potent lightning bolts could reach
the spot it had so recently occupied.

"Searching," projected Blue. "There it is. It has teleported itself
to the river." This came with a visual of its present location.

"We can't let it roam free on this planet," projected Orange.

We agreed, of course. At once, the three of us vanished from the sky
above the particular trees below us to instantly appear and occupy
some air above the Ottawa River. Off in the distance lay the lights
and the most well known landmarks of downtown. To the right and left
of us lay the lights of lesser renowned structures, which we knew,
however, to be inhabited.

The creature flew above the water heading straight for the most
prominent of the features of this nation's capital. As we soared in
swift pursuit, it passed over the Peace Tower and from there veered
away from the river and headed over the city.

It had not gone unnoticed. As it now began to circle a structure
about a kilometre from the Peace Tower, there came to our ears the
roar of police sirens. We continued to speed after it. We were close
behind it, when it dropped towards street level.

From one police cruiser, the gaze of two policemen focused on the
flying terror. I saw their intent just beginning to charge their
synapses, informing of their determination to leaped out and
confront it. Thoughts sped through their minds about normal
procedure and reports to write, once their revolvers came out of
their holsters. However, that would not deter them in this
situation. It was their aim to jump out, drawing instantly those
weapons and fire straight into the creature.

I could read their apprehensive yet determined thoughts. They knew
they were confronting something whose bones belonged in a museum.
They were not at all pleased to be doing so. Still, they had sworn
they would protect this city and nothing, not even a pterodactyl,
was going to drive them away. The sound of the sirens of backup
police cars was barely registering in their consciousness.

"Now," came the projected thought of the pterodactyl, "I will begin
to feed. These foolish ones shall be first."

I could tell the message had registered inside the minds of the
police officers, still gazing with grim determination, despite some
understandable trepidation, at the thing.

"Not if we can help it," projected Orange.

The pterodactyl ignored him, focusing its attention fully on the
policemen.

"They can't do anything," projected Blue.

"Why not bind the blasted thing with Ay-yar's Praise," suggested
Orange. He followed the suggestion with a beamed diagram of the
energy flow he envisaged.

"Agreed," I projected almost at the same microsecond as Blue.

The pterodactyl projected a visual of the revolvers going off, of
instantly both triggers being pulled again, of again and again
bullets striking and bouncing of its scales, scales as hard as
adamantine.

We wizards waited no longer. In unison we hurled into the physical
and psychic air a binding spell, a net of mental energy, woven with
the repetition of those six most potent syllables in the galaxy. We
visualized them in our alphabet. We wove them together with the
energy of our life force. We hurled this into the sky and followed
it up.

Below us, with a fraction of my mind, I could still follow the
glacial flow of energy along the policemen's synapses, directing
fingers to fling the doors of the police car open, to be followed by
the actual jumping out and drawing of revolvers. Weird as it may be
to feel the inhuman thoughts of a pterodactyl shaped nightmare
boasting inside their minds about the powerlessness of Terran
weapons to affect it, they still intended to make the effort. Yet,
our pace was too fast to allow their bullets time to pierce the sky.

Then I had not even a fraction of my mind to spare for them. My full
attention and the complete attention of my two colleagues was
demanded by the enormity of the task ahead.

There was no doubt that this creature was more than a little
surprised to find us here to confront it. This was one of the lords
of the darkest pit. It had felt itself more than sufficiently able
to take care of this world and open a new portal to permit the
transference of its master through the spaces between the
dimensions.

And here we were, not just major psychics of this planet it much
despised, but three of the greatest wizards in the galaxy. We were
the ones who had blocked the first portal, so effectively opened and
so cleverly concealed by its underlings. We were the ones who,
though we had not been unharmed, had survived its frightful attack.
More significantly, we were the ones who had uttered those soul
stirring, soul searing sounds in no language of this world. And when
the defenders of this place stood powerless to stop it, here we were
with a net woven of those, to it, inexplicably painful sounds.

Indeed, our net had sound. We visualized it as humming. It shone
with three of the seven colours of the rainbow. It throbbed with
power and both in a material and nonmaterial sense it continually
uttered the most sacred words we knew, "Ay-yar ih Ay-yar nih!"

Again the creature strove to teleport itself beyond the influence of
our most effective spell. Again it tried to disappear. And it
failed. We had with the swiftest thought possible calculated all the
paths through space and time by which it might escape. We had thrown
out the strands of our net so that anywhere in its vicinity it tried
to move it touched one of those strands. It found that so painful
that it drew back in on itself.

Suddenly, to the astonishment of the policemen watching from below,
it did seem to disappear. We knew, however, that it had not. It had
merely reversed the first of its mighty magical accomplishments on
its arrival in this dimension and on this planet. In the place of
the monstrous pterodactyl, there flew again a tiny black fly.

This was a clever design it had come up with. Its plan was to use
its smaller size to slip between the strands of our net. This plan
would probably have worked against anyone save us. However, we were
completely prepared for the ploy, and we had an enormously fast
reaction time which matched its own. We could command our net to
alter its configuration and enwrap the now tiny fly.

And bright, and fast and potent as we were, we were not good enough
to catch it. It had thought in some ultradimensional way, beyond our
ability to perceive and contacted the denizens, if not the very
lord, of its native dimension. And he now replied to save his most
trusted vassal. A hole appeared in the sky above that Ottawa
building, a hole leading to another dimension.

For only a microsecond we felt the chill of another reality about to
crash into normal space. This was no concealed doorway, as had been
the squirrel hole, with all the anti-dimensional energy directed
away from it, with the lights off, as it were. This was a complete
link between the two dimensions with the lights and everything else
free to pour across. The consequences might almost be the same as
those resulting from the contact of matter and anti-matter.

We were very sober, for we well knew what this could do in an
inhabited place to the life force of all the souls here. For only a
microsecond we began to ponder the problem of how to close it and
retain our captive. And then, before we could do anything, the hole
was closed and the black fly which had also been a sort of black
scaled pterodactyl or a dragon was gone.

"Wait for me," came a telepathic call, too late.

"Who's that?" I projected.

"Where did that cry come from?" asked Orange.

"First," projected Blue, "how about trying to conceal our identity
from whoever it is?"

"I see your point," I projected. "We can't assume that telepath
knows who we are just because the pterodactyl does. No need to throw
away a possible advantage."

"Only if it's not too draining," projected Orange.

"Agreed."

"Where is he or she located?" Orange projected again.

"Here," Blue replied. There followed a visual, clearer than any
photograph, of a street and some houses. It was a typical suburban
neighbourhood. "However, let's try to do this the human way."

"Got it," Orange projected.

"Me, too," I added.

"The Terran occultist Dion Fortune, among others," I projected,
using Enochian to envelope the telepathy, "has written about the
observation spell called a watcher. I'm activating one here, so
we'll know at once if a portal opens here again or that thing or one
of its fellows appears here."

"Well done," projected Blue.

"Now let's go visit that stranded telepath," projected Orange.
