The Roman Villa, John Percival, B.T. Barsford Ltd., London, 1976

Preface (7-8) There are many archaeological reports on villas. These
cover little of the social and economic institution. This introductory
study seeks to begin that consideration.

Definitions (13-15) A precise definition is difficult. Villas are in
the country, usually involved with agriculture and often luxurious.
This book considers the villa as an economic and social institution.

2. The Sources of Evidence (16-33) Archaeology (thousands have been
excavated, survival hazards emphasize such objects as pottery, early
excavators lacked expertise and broad focus), Representations in Art
(mosaics, wall paintings, sculpted reliefs, etc. provide glimpses from
the time of villas and country activity, such representations may
include idealized or stylized aspects), written sources (agricultural
handbooks, Cato's, Varro's, Vergil's Georgics, Columella's, some of the
Elder Pliny, Vitruvius' De Architectura, Petronius' novel, the Younger
Pliny's letters, poetry, laws, etc. offer valuable information. Some
estate records survive, largely from Egypt. Place names may suggest the
previous presence of villas.

3. Origins and Historical Development (34-50) The author considers
Augustus' establishment of the Pax Romana as the source of widespread
prosperity and cosmopolitan markets encouraging agricultural surpluses
and the extended Romanization the author sees in the institution of the
villa. Relative stability from 287-337 was cast in a more militant,
regimented light. Some areas had no restoration, some less lavish
revival and some, Britain, for example, seem fairly prosperous.
Emperors looked eastward and Western villas did not survive the
collapse of the Western Empire.

4 Regional Types and Distributions (51-105) Regions (Italy, Spain,
Africa, Gaul, Rhineland and Upper Danube, Balkans and Lower Danube,
Britain) are considered. Even within regions villas were of a variety
of sizes and styles.

5 The Pattern of Agriculture in the Western Provinces (106-117)
Mediterranean climate caused dry farming. There was two year crop
rotation. The three chief crops were grain, grapes and olives. The
north was wetter and cooler, favouring only the first of these three.

6 Villa Society and Tenure Patterns (118-144) Focusing largely on Gaul
and Britain, Percival notes the presence of tenants on large estates
and their gradual loss of freedom into the Late Empire.

7 Villa Economy and Investment (145-165) Villas, often owned by urban
people, provided agricultural surplus to towns and obtained luxuries
from towns. A peaceful empire enabled such economic activity. Some
villas grew enough food to support their residents, including staff.
Refined adornments were drawn from the owners' other wealth. These were
the minority. The extent of burdened Late Empire upper class people
withdrawing to their villas and the existence of industrial villas are
considered.

8 The Fourth Century and Beyond (166-182)
