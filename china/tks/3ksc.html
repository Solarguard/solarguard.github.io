THREE KINGDOMS, Luo Guanzhong, transl. Moss Roberts, University of
California Press/Foreign Languages Press, Berkely/Beijing, 1991

The text of SAN KUO, there called ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS, is
reviewed on this site under the earlier and more literary
translation by C. H. Brewitt-Taylor. This note contains remarks, or
rather a brief summary, of the supplementary material placed into
the more recent translation. One aspect of the newer work is that it
uses the somewhat more understandable Pinyin transliteration.
Personally, for reading purposes, I am more familiar with the older
system, even if this often renders efforts on my part to pronounce
words out loud incomprehensible to my Chinese acquaintences. I use
Pinyin below only where I'm not sure of the Wade-Giles usage.

Among additional material in this book is: the obligatory thanks, a
forward by John S. Service (mentioning his encounter with THREE
KINGDOMS in China in 1942 and earlier, the enormous influence of the
novel on early Twentieth Century Chinese intellectuals, politicians
and military leaders and the value of the novel, of this translation
and of the notes and commentary), an afterward (pp. 937-979) with
its notes (pp. 980-986), a list of some one hundred and sixteen
"principal characters," a chronology (pp. 993-996) of the main
events from 168 C.E. to 280 C.E., a list of "titles, terms and
offices," abbreviations, some ninety four pages of notes on the text
and eleven useful maps.

The afterward begins with the novel's mystic nature, its impact on
concepts of power, diplomacy and warfare, the question of dating and
authorship and the use of the mid Seventeenth Century Mao edition
with notes containing information from that edition and at times a
comparative passage from the 1552 edition.

There is a look at hereditary legitimacy and the Mandate of Heaven's
selection occasionally of one whose virtue renders him meritorious.
Both combine in Liu Pei who deserves to attract such supporters as
Kuan Yu, Chang Fei and Chuko Liang. The fraternal nature of the
Peach Garden Oath is contrasted with Chuko Liang's traditional
hierarchical view of the lord/vassal relationship.

The novel's use of historical sources, the influence on it of
storytellers and dramatists and the impact of their times on a
number of individuals cited as holding various views on it are
presented. A chief difference of viewpoint is that between
supporters of Liu Pei's legitimacy (who include T'ang historian Liu
Zhiji 661-721 and Sung philosopher Chu Shi) and those inclining to
sympathy for Ts'ao Ts'ao (including T'ang emperors Li Shih-min and
Hsuan Tsung and Sung historian Ssuma Kuang), often influenced by
where and under what conditions such commentators are residing. The
novel itself, perhaps composed with the consciousness of current or
recent Mongol domination, clearly favours the legitimacy of Liu Pei
and Han-Shu.

There is mention of Mao Zonggang's Seventeenth Century commentary,
Mao's identification of chronological segments, dominant characters
(especially Chuko Liang Kungming, Kuan Yu and Ts'ao Ts'ao) of causal
issues and of artistic patterning. The character of Kuan Yu perhaps
owes some of its increased prominence in later times to performances
of plays in his temples. There is a closing examination of the role
of Chuko Liang.

   The virtues the novel ascribes to Kongming also have ample
   historical basis: his loyalty to his liege; his untiring
   dedication to the cause of the Han; his ability in civil and
   military administration; his strategic insight; his receptivity
   to the views of subordinates; his personal humility and
   willingness to accept responsibility for failure; his fairness in
   applying the law and assigning reward and punishment; his skill
   as an inventor; and his honorable refusal to use his position to
   enrich himself. p. 975

One issue raised is that of Liu Feng, Liu Pei's adopted and elder
son, set aside when an heir was designated with the favouring of the
natural and younger Liu Chan. Liu Feng is promptly executed after he
fails to send assistance to Kuan Yu. Another issue is that of Wei
Yen, apparently seen by Moss Roberts as contributing much to Han-Shu
and as being maltreated by Chuko Liang.

In future there may be additional remarks here on the notes to the
text, as well as some comments on the translation, beyond the
initial observation that my experience has scarves going around the
neck, so altering Yellow Turbans to Yellow Scarves strikes me as a
degeneration, rather than an enhancement. I am especially interested
in the rich poetical component of the novel and look forward to a
comparing of the renditions by the two translators, as well as, in
time to responding personally to inspirations arising from some of
the more moving poems in this text.
