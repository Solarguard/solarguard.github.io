Muqaddimah, Ibn Khaldun, transl. Franz Rosenthal, Pantheon, New York
1958 v. 1, parts 2 and 3.

(pp. 249-310): Farmers and herders need fields for subsistence.
Conveniences and luxuries come with urbanization. Herding camels takes
Arabs deep into the wild. Herders seeking luxuries and conveniences
become urbanites. Cities are excessive; rural dwellers and herders more
naturally good, courageous, hardy, identifying with kinship groups.
Herders carefully remember their genealogy. Leadership grows from kin
identity. Urbanites lack strong kinship identity. 

Matter composes and decomposes. This applies to crafts, sciences and
the prestige of noble houses, which usually dissipates in four
generations. Hardier herders more likely achieve dominance over
urbanites. The apex of group feeling is kingship, vitiated by
debilitating luxury and will sapping laws and taxes. Good qualities
indicate potential for kingship. Commission of unworthy deeds exposes
a house's incompetence.

Another branch of a royal line may replace a declining one. The
defeated adopt the ways of their masters, some to such an extent their
nations vanish. Nomads often are thwarted by rugged terrain and city
walls. Nomads ruin settlements, craftsmen escaping enforced labour.
Nomads are least accepting of royal authority and very responsive to
the spiritual influence of prophets. Nomads may respond to a persuasive
urban ruler and urban rulers can attempt to impose power perhaps by
policies of divide and conquer.

III (313-481): Contention for royal power causes conflict and war.
Dynastic decline obscures original group identity, sometimes among 
divided remnants of a realm. At times members of dynastic houses may
found new dynasties in remote regions. Religion unites people and
establishes firm dynastic authority. Without group identity claims to
prophetic authority fail.

Dynasties expanding their reach beyond areas of their group identity
may weaken themselves. It helps a dynasy to have numerous supporters.
Governing areas of disparite and divided group identity is difficult,
rebellion frequent. Areas lacking strong group identity may be easy 
to acquire and govern.

Dynastic authority naturally is centred in one individual. Luxury and
tranquility indicate approaching decline. These breed weak people and 
cause excessive taxation. Usually a dynasty is founded by a hardy 
generation, sees a second retain some of the original stamina and 
generates a third luxury loving people who are the decline of their
kind. Entering settled life is an aspect of the weakening process.

Dynastic stages are: victory, consolidation, impressive organization
and buildings, imitation, extravagant waste. Ancient ruins testify to
past dynastic strength. These were built by ordinary humans. Cited 
are financial records. When a ruler turns from his group to outsiders
the dynasty is declining. Here Ibn Khaldun stresses significance of
ancestry for group identity. 

With authority vested in one individual, actual power can come to 
influential ministers, especially during minorities and reigns of 
weak monarchs. Such ministers lack royal recognition and seldom are
dissatisfied with exercising power without kingly appellation.

Popular support decreases with increasing royal harshness. A ruler 
may also be too clever and make excessive demands. The Caliphate 
adds the spiritual aspect to mundane considerations. One purpose of
religion is humanity's continuation. Both worldly rulers and Caliphs
(Imams) can enforce order amongst people of varying views.

An imam has knowledge, probity, competence and wholesome physical
being. Disputed is an additional requirement of Qurayshi descent. 
Shiah believe Muhammad appointed Ali first successor. Diverse Shiah
sects have differing beliefs. Some expect the return of the twelfth
imam. 

Muhammad encouraged people to prefer awareness of joint descent from
Adam and Eve to divisive pride in more recent ancestors. He 
criticized irreligious royal extravagance. Dynastic authority 
focused correctly remains legitimate. The oath of allegiance, invalid
if compelled, is a legal contract.

Caliph appoint successors and family may be appointed. Some hold 
tyranny absolves the oath of allegiance, others note revolt sheds 
much blood. 

The Caliph is the prophet's representative with spiritual 
responsibilities. He leads prayer, administering great mosques. He
ensures only the worthy judge and teach. Caliph Umar instructed
equality before the law, just mediation, correction of erroneous
verdicts, timely justice and judging while alert.

The police function, including care of prisoners and rendering
punishment, is spiritual. Judicial rulings are to be spiritually
founded, witnesses to be upright peiople. Market supervisors were
appointed by judges, mint directors by the Caliph. Originally the
Caliph was the prophet's representative and the title Commander of
the Faithful became popular in time.

The Jewish cohen and Christian patriarch or pope have religious
responsibility, other men being king and emperor.
