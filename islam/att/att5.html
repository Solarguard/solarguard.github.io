This is a very rough summary of books 18 to 20 of the English
translation. The first of these at Tabari files has  comments on 
his range and capacity and the poverty of this attempt  to precis
his work. This file was last updated on November 8, 2006. Here 
are described highly important years and events of the greatest
significance. In future this summary may be more effectively
rewritten, but still will fail to suggest more than a glimmer of 
the full work.

at Tabari vol. 18, transl. Michael G. Morony (UCLA), SUNY, Albany,
1987 text pp 2-226. At present (14/10/2006) about a hundred of

A.H. 60 (13/10/679-30/9/680): Mu'awiyah died. His accomplishments,

succeed him.

vol. 19 "The Caliphate of Yazid b. Mu'awiyah" transl. I.K.A. 
Howard of the University of Edinburgh, SUNY, Albany, 1990.

Foreward: Yazid's caliphate is largely described as the opposition
to him by Husayn and Abdallah. Accounts of the six people Mu'awiyah 
sought to win to Yazid's side could refer to the Council selecting
the successor. They did not appoint Yazid.

Sources for at Tabari such as Dinawari and Yakubi and others such 
as Baladhuri, Mas'udi and al Mufid provide valuable roles in the
corraboration of him and demonstrating his high degree of detail 
and specified chains of transmission. There is also the
hagiograpgical literature.  

Baladhuri has fuller and chronoligically more accurate accounts of
events in Mecca.

A.H. 60 (Cont. 22/4/680-30/9/680): Mu'awiyah died on April 22, 680.
Yazid received allegiance. Marwan failed in his mission to secure
support for Yazid from Husayn and Abdallah ibn Zubayr. Yazid 
ordered Amr lead an army. There was fighting in Mecca.

Kufans invited Husayn. Yazid received reports Kufans favoured 
Husayn and commanded Ubatdallah secure the city. Decisively he did
so. Husayn was advised to remain in Hijaz, even go to Yemen. He set
out for Kufah.

Ubaydallah defended Kufah. Husayn offered to depart for Arabia, to
Yazid or a frontier post. Ubaydallah refused. Hurr, a cavalry 
commander, defected to Husayn. Husayn and his small party were
defeated on October 10, 680.

A.H. 61 (1/10/680-19/9/681): There are some one hundred pages here
describing details of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn and its 
immediate aftermath. A list of those killed with Husayn indicates 
the swath hereby cut in the descendants of Ali. The fight was long 
and there was hesitation to kill Husayn as many did not want his 
blood on  their hands. Captives (women and children and sick Ali, 
son of Husayn) were spared. Their utterances confirm the nobility 
of this family.

A.H. 62 (20/9/681-9/9/682): Summoned to Yazid, Amr explained his 
actions concerning Zubayr. A Medinan deligation met Yazid. They
returned and denounced him. Mundhir ibn Zubayr went to Basrah.
Yazid ordered Mundhir imprisoned, but Ubaydallah allowed him to 
leave for Medina. He spoke even more harshly against Yazid.

A.H. 63 (10/9/682-29/8/683): Many in Medina repudiated Yazid and
moved against Umayyah clan members there. Informed Yazid sent a 
large force under Muslim ibn Uqbah. On the Syrians' approach, the
Umayyah swore not to harm other Medinans and left the City.

Muslim urged Medinans to accept Yazid, so without combat he could 
pass on to Mecca. They replied they would oppose this. Medinans 
lost. Some prominent survivors were executed. Ali ibn Husayn who
had not fought was spared on Yazid's previous order.

A.H. 64 (30/8/683-17/8/684): Muslim died on the way to Mecca. His
dying words praised his taking of Medina and held the appointment 
of his successor, Husayn ibn Numayr, as Yazid's command. Meccans
lost. The Ka'bah's covering was damaged by fire.

News came of Yazid's death, aged thirty eight or thirty five.  

vol. 20 "The Collapse of Sufyanid Authority and the Coming of the
Marwanids" tr. G.R. Hawting (of U. London), SUNY, Albany, 1989

Foreward (pp. xi-xviii): This volume covers early years of the
second civil war. Three groups (Zubayrid, Shi'ite, Kharijite)
contended with Umayyids. Tribal allegiances were important. Much
of this volume comes from two sources, Umar ibn Shabbah and 
Hisham ibn Muhammad al Kalbi.

A.H. 64 (30/8/683-17/8/684): Fighting halted at Mecca. Zubayr
remained there. Ubaydallah was opposed in Iraq. He fled Basra at
night sitting behind Harith on Harith's mule. Basrans chose 
Abdallah ibn Harith leader. There was inter tribal conflict.
Masud supporting Ubaydallah was killed. Ubaydallah fled to 
Syria.

Amr ibn Masud was chosen leader in Kufa. Marwan became caliph 
in Syria. Dahhak, Zubayr's man in Damascus, was opposed in the
mosque and defeated in battle. 

Salm was governor in Khurasan until Yazid's death. Muhallab
succeeded him. Salm appointed two men commander of Marwan. 
They contended. There was fighting in Herat.

In Kufa penitents regretted not supporting Husayn. 

Ibn Ziyad had strenuously pursued the Khawarij. They had gone 
to Abdallah ibn Zubayr in Mecca. After Yazid's death, they 
left ibn Zubayr. 

Ibn Zubayr levelled the very damaged Ka'bah, extended its 
foundations and entrusted its contents to the gatekeepers.

A.H. 65 (18/8/684-7/8/685): Penitents raised the cry, "Avenge
Husayn" in Kufa. Several thousand went to Husayn's tomb and
mourned him. They advanced and outnumbered fell fighting. 

In Ramadan (April/May 685) Marwan was suffocated to death with
a pillow. He had appointed his two sons heirs. A Syrian force
failed to take Medina. Many died of plague in Basra. Muhallab
ibn Abi Sufra defeated Kharijites threatening Basra. Ibn Zubayr
rebuilt the Ka'bah. Fighting continued in Khurasan.

A.H. 66 (8/8/685-27/7/685): Mukhtar ibn Abi Ubayd rose in Kufa 
to avenge Husayn. He seized the governor's residence, obtained
the nine million dirhams in the treasury and paid his some ten
thousand men some three million. He appointed commanders in
Armenia, Adharbayjan, Mada'in, Upper, Central and Lower 
Bihqubadh and Hulwan.
